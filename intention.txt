Model Intention Summary:
1. This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. COTS dynamics include density-dependent growth, a smooth threshold mechanism that triggers outbreak events, and environmental forcing (i.e., sea-surface temperature effects and larval immigration).
3. Coral communities (fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites) experience selective predation by COTS, captured using saturating functional responses.
4. The interplay of these processes produces characteristic boom-bust cycles observed in ecological data.
