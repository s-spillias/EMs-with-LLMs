This model simulates Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impacts on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS population growth and immigration events
2. Differential predation by COTS on two coral functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)
3. Coral growth dynamics with resource limitation and competition
4. Feedback mechanisms between coral cover and COTS populations

The model incorporates key ecological processes including:
- Density-dependent COTS population regulation
- Preferential feeding of COTS on fast-growing corals
- Temperature-mediated coral growth and mortality
- Coral recovery dynamics following disturbance
- Immigration-driven COTS outbreak cycles

This model can be used to predict future COTS outbreaks and their impacts on coral community composition under different environmental scenarios, supporting reef management decision-making.
