# Ecological Model Improvement: Coral-COTS Feedback Mechanism

## Current Model Performance
The current model shows reasonable tracking of general trends but fails to capture important dynamics:
1. For COTS populations (cots_pred), the model underestimates major outbreak peaks around 1990-1995
2. For slow-growing coral (slow_pred), the model significantly underestimates the peak around 1990
3. For fast-growing coral (fast_pred), the model shows better fit but still misses some fluctuations

## Ecological Improvement: Temperature-Enhanced COTS Reproduction
I've implemented a temperature-dependent reproduction mechanism for COTS. Research shows that warmer temperatures can enhance COTS larval development and survival, leading to population outbreaks. This is particularly important as climate change continues to affect coral reef ecosystems.

This creates an important ecological feedback:
- Higher SST → Enhanced COTS reproduction → Increased coral predation
- This positive feedback can explain the rapid COTS outbreaks observed in the historical data

## Implementation Details
1. Added a temperature-dependent reproduction modifier for COTS that increases reproduction at higher temperatures
2. Added a new parameter `temp_repro_threshold` representing the temperature above which COTS reproduction is enhanced
3. Added a new parameter `temp_repro_effect` controlling the strength of temperature enhancement on reproduction

This mechanism is ecologically justified because:
- COTS larval development is temperature-sensitive, with faster development at higher temperatures
- Warmer waters can increase phytoplankton availability, which is food for COTS larvae
- Historical COTS outbreaks have been associated with warmer periods
- The mechanism creates a realistic positive feedback loop in the ecosystem

The improvement maintains model parsimony while adding an ecologically meaningful mechanism that should better capture the observed dynamics. I've simplified the implementation to use a linear response above the threshold temperature rather than a sigmoid function to improve numerical stability.
