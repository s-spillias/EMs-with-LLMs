This model simulates Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impacts on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population growth through density-dependent reproduction and mortality
2. Immigration events that can trigger outbreaks
3. Selective predation by COTS on two coral functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)
4. Differential coral growth and recovery rates between coral functional groups
5. Environmental effects (sea surface temperature) on both COTS and coral dynamics
6. Feedback mechanisms where coral availability limits COTS population growth

The model aims to predict COTS outbreak patterns and subsequent coral community responses, providing insights for reef management strategies. It uses a state-space modeling approach with process error to account for ecological stochasticity and observation error to handle measurement uncertainty.
