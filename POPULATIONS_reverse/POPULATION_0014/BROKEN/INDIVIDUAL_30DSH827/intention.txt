# Ecological Model Improvement: Coral-COTS Interaction Dynamics

## Current Model Performance Assessment
Based on the comparison plots, the current model:
1. Underestimates peaks in COTS population (cots_pred) around 1990-1992
2. Smooths out the high variability in slow-growing coral cover (slow_pred)
3. Fails to capture the sharp decline in fast-growing coral cover (fast_pred) around 1990

## Ecological Improvement: Density-Dependent COTS Predation Efficiency
The current model uses a simple functional response for COTS predation on corals, but doesn't account for how COTS density affects their feeding efficiency. In reality, COTS exhibit density-dependent predation behavior:

1. At low densities, COTS feed individually and efficiently
2. At high densities, COTS may:
   - Form feeding fronts that can devastate coral communities
   - Exhibit coordinated feeding behavior
   - Overwhelm coral defense mechanisms
   - Create positive feedback loops where initial coral damage attracts more COTS

This density-dependent predation efficiency is particularly important during COTS outbreaks, when their numbers spike dramatically. The current model underestimates both the impact of COTS during outbreaks and the subsequent coral decline.

## Implementation
I've modified the model to include a density-dependent predation efficiency term that:
1. Increases predation rates when COTS density is high (outbreak conditions)
2. Maintains normal predation rates at low COTS densities
3. Uses a threshold-based function to create a smooth transition between these states

This improvement should better capture:
- The rapid coral decline during COTS outbreaks (especially visible in the 1990-1992 period)
- The variability in coral cover over time
- The ecological feedback between COTS density and coral mortality

The new parameter (cots_density_effect) represents the strength of this density-dependent effect on predation efficiency. When COTS density exceeds a threshold (set at 1.0 individuals/mÂ²), the predation rate increases proportionally to the density, up to a maximum multiplier to prevent unrealistic values.

This ecological mechanism is supported by field observations of COTS outbreaks, where coral mortality is often more severe than would be predicted by simple per-capita predation rates.
