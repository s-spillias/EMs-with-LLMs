# Model Improvement: Adding Coral Competition Dynamics

## Current Model Performance
Based on the comparison plots between historical and modeled data:

1. **Slow-growing corals**: The model currently underestimates the peaks in slow-growing coral cover around 1985-1990, and doesn't capture the variability seen in the historical data. The model shows a smoother trajectory than the actual data.

2. **COTS population**: The model captures some oscillations in COTS population but misses the timing of some peaks, particularly around 1990-1995. The model also doesn't fully capture the amplitude of fluctuations.

3. **Fast-growing corals**: The model smooths out variations seen in the historical data, particularly missing the sharp peaks around 1980 and 1990.

## Ecological Improvement: Coral Competition
I've added explicit competition between slow-growing and fast-growing corals, which is a critical ecological mechanism in coral reef systems. In nature, corals compete for limited resources including space, light, and nutrients. This competition is asymmetric, with different coral types having different competitive abilities.

### Ecological Justification
1. **Space limitation**: Corals compete for limited space on the reef substrate. Fast-growing branching corals can quickly occupy space, potentially outcompeting slower-growing massive corals.

2. **Asymmetric competition**: Different coral morphologies have different competitive strategies. Fast-growing corals can shade slow-growing ones, while slow-growing massive corals can be more resistant to disturbance.

3. **Dynamic feedback**: Competition creates important feedback mechanisms that can explain the oscillatory patterns seen in the historical data, where one coral type increases while another decreases.

### Implementation Details
I modified the coral growth equations to include competition terms:

1. Added two new parameters:
   - `comp_slow_fast`: Competition effect of fast-growing corals on slow-growing corals
   - `comp_fast_slow`: Competition effect of slow-growing corals on fast-growing corals

2. Modified the competition terms in the growth equations:
   - For slow-growing corals: `competition_slow = 1 - (slow_t1 + comp_slow_fast * fast_t1) / K_slow`
   - For fast-growing corals: `competition_fast = 1 - (fast_t1 + comp_fast_slow * slow_t1) / K_fast`

3. These competition terms replace the simple density dependence terms in the original model, allowing for more complex interactions between coral types.

### Expected Improvements
This modification should:

1. Better capture the oscillatory dynamics seen in the historical data, particularly the peaks and troughs in coral cover.

2. Allow for more realistic responses to disturbances, as competition can amplify or dampen the effects of COTS predation.

3. Create indirect pathways between components - for example, COTS predation on one coral type can indirectly benefit the other coral type through reduced competition.

4. Improve the model's ability to represent the complex feedback mechanisms that drive coral reef dynamics over time.

The competition coefficients are set based on ecological understanding that fast-growing corals often have stronger competitive effects on slow-growing corals (comp_slow_fast = 0.8) than vice versa (comp_fast_slow = 0.5), reflecting the different growth strategies and morphologies of these coral types.
