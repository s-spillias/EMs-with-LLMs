# Model Improvement: Coral Recovery Threshold After COTS Predation

## Current Model Performance
The current model shows several limitations in capturing the dynamics between COTS and coral populations:

1. The slow-growing coral predictions (slow_pred) show a smoothed trend that fails to capture the sharp decline around 1990-1992 followed by recovery.
2. The COTS predictions (cots_pred) underestimate peak outbreaks and don't capture the cyclical nature of COTS populations.
3. The fast-growing coral predictions (fast_pred) similarly smooth out the dynamics, missing important fluctuations.

## Ecological Mechanism Added
I've implemented a coral recovery threshold mechanism that represents how coral recovery rates are affected by the severity of COTS predation. This is based on the ecological understanding that:

1. Severe COTS predation can reduce coral colonies below critical thresholds needed for effective reproduction and recovery.
2. When coral cover falls below certain thresholds due to COTS outbreaks, recovery becomes disproportionately slower.
3. This creates important feedback loops in the system where severe predation events have longer-lasting impacts than moderate ones.

## Implementation
The implementation uses a sigmoid function to modify coral growth rates based on recent predation intensity. When predation exceeds a threshold, coral recovery is significantly reduced, representing the difficulty of recovery from severe damage. This creates a hysteresis effect where recovery follows a different trajectory than decline.

## Expected Improvements
This change should:
1. Better capture the sharp declines in coral cover following COTS outbreaks
2. Show more realistic recovery patterns after severe predation events
3. Create more pronounced cyclical dynamics in the system
4. Better represent the ecological reality of coral reef resilience thresholds

The new parameter (pred_threshold) represents the ecological concept of a critical threshold beyond which coral recovery is impaired, which is well-documented in coral reef ecology literature.
