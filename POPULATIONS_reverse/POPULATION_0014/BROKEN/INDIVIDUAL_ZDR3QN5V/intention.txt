# Ecological Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Coral Vulnerability

## Current Model Performance Assessment
Looking at the comparison plots between modeled and historical data:

1. **Slow-growing coral (slow_pred)**: The model shows a linear increasing trend while historical data shows high variability with peaks in the 1980s and early 1990s, followed by a decline.

2. **Fast-growing coral (fast_pred)**: The model shows a steadily increasing trend that greatly overestimates the actual coral cover, especially after 1990.

3. **COTS (cots_pred)**: The model captures some of the outbreak dynamics but misses the timing and magnitude of certain peaks.

## Ecological Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Coral Vulnerability to COTS Predation

I've implemented a temperature-dependent vulnerability mechanism for coral predation by COTS. This is ecologically justified because:

1. Higher temperatures can stress corals, making them more susceptible to predation
2. Stressed corals may have reduced defense mechanisms
3. COTS feeding behavior and efficiency can be temperature-dependent

The modification introduces temperature-dependent predation rates where:
- As temperatures exceed coral optimal temperatures, corals become more vulnerable to COTS predation
- This creates an important feedback mechanism where warming can accelerate coral loss through both direct temperature stress and increased predation vulnerability
- This indirect pathway better represents the complex ecological interactions in coral reef systems

This change should improve the model's ability to capture:
- The decline in coral cover during warmer periods
- The differential impacts on fast vs. slow growing corals
- The timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks in relation to temperature changes

The implementation uses a biologically realistic functional form where vulnerability increases linearly as temperatures exceed a thermal threshold, with fast-growing corals being more sensitive to this effect than slow-growing corals. The model has been simplified to improve numerical stability while maintaining the key ecological mechanisms.
