# Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Predation Rates

## Current Model Performance
Looking at the comparison plots between modeled and historical data:

1. **Slow-growing corals**: The model shows a linear increasing trend while historical data shows high variability with peaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
2. **Fast-growing corals**: The model shows a steadily increasing trend that greatly overestimates actual coral cover, especially after 1990.
3. **COTS population**: The model captures some of the outbreak dynamics but misses the timing and magnitude of peaks.

## Ecological Improvement
I've implemented temperature-dependent predation rates for Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). This is ecologically justified because:

1. COTS feeding rates are known to be temperature-dependent, with increased metabolism and feeding at higher temperatures up to a thermal optimum.
2. This creates an important feedback mechanism where warming can temporarily increase coral mortality through enhanced COTS predation.
3. The current model uses fixed predation coefficients that don't account for this temperature sensitivity.

## Implementation Details
The predation rates (alpha_slow and alpha_fast) are now modified by a temperature response function:
- Predation increases with temperature up to an optimal temperature for COTS feeding
- Beyond the optimal temperature, feeding rates decline as physiological stress increases
- This creates a dome-shaped temperature response curve for predation using a Gaussian function

## Mathematical Implementation
I've replaced the linear temperature response with a Gaussian function:
