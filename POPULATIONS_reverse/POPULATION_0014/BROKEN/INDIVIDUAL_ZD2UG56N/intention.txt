# Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Predation Rates

## Current Model Performance
Looking at the comparison plots between modeled and historical data:

1. The slow-growing coral model shows a linear increasing trend while historical data shows high variability with peaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
2. The fast-growing coral model shows a steady increase over time, diverging significantly from the historical data which shows a general decline.
3. The COTS (Crown-of-thorns starfish) model captures some peaks but doesn't fully represent the dynamics seen in historical data.

## Ecological Improvement
I've implemented temperature-dependent predation rates for COTS on both coral types. In the current model, predation rates are simplified and constant, but in reality, COTS feeding behavior is strongly influenced by temperature. Research shows that COTS metabolism and feeding rates increase with temperature up to an optimal point, then decline at higher temperatures.

This change introduces a temperature-dependent modifier to the predation rates, creating a more realistic representation of how COTS impacts corals under varying temperature conditions. The modification uses a simpler linear response where:
- Predation rates are highest at the optimal temperature for COTS
- Predation rates decrease linearly as temperature deviates from the optimum
- The effect is bounded to prevent extreme values

## Expected Improvements
This change should:
1. Create more dynamic predation pressure that varies with environmental conditions
2. Better capture the observed fluctuations in coral cover, especially during temperature anomalies
3. Improve the model's ability to represent the feedback between COTS abundance and coral cover
4. Provide more realistic predictions under future temperature scenarios

The temperature-dependent predation mechanism represents an important ecological process that was missing in the original model and should help better capture the observed dynamics in the system. I've simplified the implementation to ensure numerical stability while still capturing the essential ecological relationship.
