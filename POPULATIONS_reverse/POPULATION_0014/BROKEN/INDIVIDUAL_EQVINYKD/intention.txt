Model Improvement: Adaptive Predation Preference Based on Coral Availability

Current Model Assessment:
Looking at the comparison plots between historical and modeled data, I observe several discrepancies:
1. The model underestimates peaks in slow-growing coral cover, particularly around 1990-1992
2. The model doesn't capture the rapid fluctuations in COTS populations
3. Fast-growing coral predictions show reasonable tracking but miss some key dynamics

Ecological Improvement:
I'm implementing adaptive predation preference for COTS based on relative coral availability. In nature, predators often switch to more abundant prey when their preferred food becomes scarce - a phenomenon known as prey switching. The current model uses fixed attack rates (a_fast and a_slow) regardless of the relative abundance of coral types.

By implementing a prey-switching mechanism, COTS will preferentially target the more abundant coral type, which creates a stabilizing feedback:
- When fast-growing coral becomes abundant, COTS will increase predation on it
- When slow-growing coral becomes abundant, COTS will shift preference toward it
- This creates a more realistic predator-prey dynamic with negative feedback

The implementation uses a simple linear scaling function to adjust predation pressure based on the relative abundance of coral types. This better represents the ecological reality where COTS are opportunistic predators that adjust their feeding behavior based on available resources.

I've implemented a conservative prey switching mechanism where:
- The attack rate on fast-growing coral increases linearly with its relative abundance
- The attack rate on slow-growing coral decreases linearly with fast-growing coral's relative abundance
- The scaling is limited to a 25% change in either direction to ensure model stability

This approach creates a stabilizing feedback loop in the system:
1. As one coral type becomes more abundant, predation pressure on it increases
2. As predation reduces its abundance, predation pressure shifts to the other coral type
3. This allows the first coral type to recover, creating natural oscillations

Expected Improvements:
1. Better capture of the peaks and valleys in coral cover
2. More realistic predator-prey dynamics
3. Improved representation of the feedback mechanisms between COTS and coral populations
4. Better fit to historical data, especially during outbreak periods

This change adds ecological realism without excessive complexity, focusing on a well-documented ecological mechanism (prey switching) that is likely important in this system. The conservative linear scaling approach provides a robust implementation that avoids potential numerical instabilities while still capturing the essential ecological dynamics.
