This model simulates Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impacts on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS population growth and immigration events
2. Differential predation by COTS on two coral functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae spp. and Porites spp.)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.)
3. Coral growth dynamics with competition between coral types
4. Feedback mechanisms where coral cover affects COTS mortality through resource limitation
5. Environmental forcing via sea surface temperature (SST) effects on both COTS and coral dynamics

The model aims to predict COTS outbreak patterns and subsequent coral community responses, accounting for the selective feeding preferences of COTS and differential recovery rates of coral functional groups. This enables exploration of long-term ecosystem trajectories and potential management interventions to mitigate COTS outbreaks.
