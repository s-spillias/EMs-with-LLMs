# Model Improvement: Incorporating Coral Competition and Temperature-Dependent Predation Efficiency

## Current Model Performance
Based on the comparison plots, the current model shows several limitations:

1.  **Fast-growing coral dynamics**: The model underestimates the peaks and valleys in fast-growing coral cover, particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s.

2. **Slow-growing coral dynamics**: The model fails to capture the extreme peak around 1990 in slow-growing coral cover and generally smooths out the observed fluctuations.

3. **COTS population dynamics**: The model captures some of the general trends but misses the timing of peaks, particularly around 1990-1992.

## Ecological Improvements Implemented

I've implemented two key ecological mechanisms that were missing from the original model:

1. **Coral Competition**: In coral reef ecosystems, slow and fast-growing corals compete for limited resources like space, light, and nutrients. The original model treated each coral type independently, which is ecologically unrealistic. I've added a competition term that allows each coral type to inhibit the growth of the other, using a modified logistic growth equation:

   ```
   slow_competition = 1.0 - (slow_t1 / K_slow) - comp_effect * (fast_t1 / K_fast)
   fast_competition = 1.0 - (fast_t1 / K_fast) - comp_effect * (slow_t1 / K_slow)
   ```

   This creates a more realistic feedback mechanism where increases in one coral type can suppress the growth of the other, potentially explaining some of the observed oscillations in the data.

2. **Temperature-Dependent Predation Efficiency**: In the original model, COTS predation rates were independent of temperature, which is ecologically unrealistic. COTS are ectothermic organisms whose metabolic rates and feeding behaviors are strongly influenced by temperature. I've added a temperature-dependent predation efficiency term:

   ```
   pred_efficiency = 0.5 + 0.5 * temp_effect_cots
   ```

   This scales predation efficiency from 50% to 100% based on how close the temperature is to the COTS optimal temperature. This creates an important feedback where temperature affects not only COTS growth but also their impact on coral populations.

## Technical Implementation

I've significantly simplified the model implementation to improve numerical stability:

1. **Simplified conditional logic**: Using the ternary operator (condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false) instead of if-statements for better gradient calculation.

2. **Removed penalty terms**: Eliminated complex penalty functions that were causing gradient issues.

3. **Increased minimum values**: Used larger minimum values (0.01 instead of 1e-8) to prevent numerical underflow.

4. **Simplified temperature effect calculation**: Streamlined the temperature effect calculation to avoid potential division by zero.

5. **Separated likelihood calculation**: Moved the likelihood calculation to a separate loop for clarity and stability.

## Expected Improvements

These changes should improve the model's ability to:

1. **Capture oscillatory dynamics**: The competition between coral types creates a natural mechanism for oscillations, which should better match the observed fluctuations in coral cover.

2. **Represent temperature-driven effects**: By making predation efficiency temperature-dependent, the model can better capture how environmental changes affect the entire ecosystem through multiple pathways.

3. **Improve fit during extreme events**: The modified model should better represent the system's response during extreme events like the 1990-1992 period, where interactions between components likely intensified.

The new parameter `comp_effect` has been added with a value of 0.3, representing moderate competition between coral types, based on literature about coral reef community dynamics.
