# Model Improvement: Threshold-Based COTS Outbreak Dynamics

## Current Model Performance
The current model shows several limitations in capturing the ecological dynamics:
1. It underestimates peaks in COTS population (cots_pred comparison)
2. It fails to capture the sharp declines in coral cover following COTS outbreaks
3. The modeled values are too smooth compared to the historical data, suggesting missing ecological mechanisms

## Ecological Improvement: Allee Effect and Outbreak Threshold
I've implemented a critical ecological mechanism: a positive density-dependent effect (Allee effect) in COTS population dynamics when they reach certain densities. This represents:

1. **Aggregation behavior**: When COTS reach certain densities, they aggregate for spawning, increasing reproductive success
2. **Predator saturation**: At higher densities, COTS can overwhelm predator control mechanisms
3. **Outbreak dynamics**: A non-linear response where population growth accelerates above certain thresholds

The implementation uses a simple threshold-based approach where growth rate increases by a fixed multiplier when COTS density exceeds a critical threshold. This creates a positive feedback loop that better captures the boom-bust cycles observed in real COTS populations.

## Expected Improvements
This change should:
- Better capture the sharp peaks in COTS populations seen in the historical data
- Improve the model's ability to represent the subsequent impacts on coral cover
- Create more realistic boom-bust cycles in the modeled ecosystem
- Maintain ecological realism while adding minimal complexity (only two parameters)

The new parameters (cots_outbreak_threshold and outbreak_multiplier) have strong ecological justification in COTS biology and outbreak dynamics documented in coral reef literature.
