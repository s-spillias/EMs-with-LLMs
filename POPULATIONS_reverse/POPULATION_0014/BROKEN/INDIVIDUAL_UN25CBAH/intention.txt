# Ecological Model Improvement: Density-Dependent COTS Predation Efficiency

## Current Model Performance
The current model shows several limitations in capturing the dynamics between Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and coral populations:

1. The model underestimates peak COTS outbreaks, particularly around 1990-1992
2. The model fails to capture the subsequent rapid decline in coral cover following these outbreaks
3. The recovery patterns of both fast and slow-growing corals after disturbances are not well represented

## Ecological Mechanism Added: Density-Dependent Predation Efficiency
I've implemented a density-dependent predation efficiency mechanism for COTS. This reflects the ecological reality that during outbreaks (high COTS density), their feeding behavior changes in several important ways:

1. **Group feeding behavior**: At high densities, COTS exhibit aggregative feeding, which increases their efficiency in consuming coral tissue
2. **Reduced predation risk**: Large groups of COTS experience reduced per-capita predation risk, allowing more time for feeding
3. **Broader diet selection**: During outbreaks, COTS expand their dietary preferences to include less-preferred coral species

This mechanism is implemented through a density-dependent multiplier on the attack rates that increases as COTS population increases, up to a saturation point. This creates a positive feedback loop during outbreaks - as COTS numbers increase, their feeding efficiency increases, leading to more rapid coral decline and potentially explaining the dramatic peaks observed in the historical data.

## Expected Improvements
This change should:
1. Better capture the magnitude of COTS outbreak impacts on coral
2. Improve the representation of coral decline during outbreak periods
3. Create more realistic boom-bust cycles in the COTS-coral system
4. Better match the historical patterns seen in the data, particularly the sharp peaks in COTS abundance and corresponding coral declines

The addition of this ecological mechanism is parsimonious - adding minimal complexity while capturing an important feedback process in the system that is supported by field observations of COTS behavior during outbreaks.
