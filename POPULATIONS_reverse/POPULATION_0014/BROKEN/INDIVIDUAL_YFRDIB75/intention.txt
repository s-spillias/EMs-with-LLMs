# Model Improvement: Density-Dependent Predation Efficiency

## Current Model Performance
Based on the comparison plots between modeled and historical data:

1. **COTS Population (cots_pred)**: The model underestimates peak COTS outbreaks, particularly around 1990-1993. The model also doesn't capture some of the population fluctuations well.

2. **Slow-Growing Coral (slow_pred)**: The model doesn't adequately capture the dynamics of slow-growing coral, especially during high COTS abundance periods. The historical data shows much sharper declines and higher peaks than the model predicts.

3. **Fast-Growing Coral (fast_pred)**: While the model performs better for fast-growing coral, it still misses some patterns, particularly around 1985-1990.

## Ecological Improvement: Interference Competition Among Predators

I've implemented a density-dependent predation efficiency mechanism to better represent the ecological dynamics of COTS predation on coral. This improvement is based on the following ecological principles: 

1. **Interference Competition**: At high densities, predators often interfere with each other's feeding activities, reducing per capita feeding rates. This is a well-documented phenomenon in predator-prey systems.

2. **Functional Response Modification**: The standard Type II functional response assumes constant predator efficiency regardless of predator density. By incorporating a density-dependent efficiency term, we can more realistically model how COTS feeding rates change with population density.

3. **Ecological Mechanism**: The modified equation represents how COTS may compete for feeding space on coral colonies, potentially interfere with each other's feeding activities, or even trigger defensive responses in corals when COTS densities are high.

## Implementation Details

The key change is the addition of a predator efficiency term that decreases as COTS density increases:
