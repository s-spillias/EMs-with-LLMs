# Model Improvement: Coral Competition and Space Limitation

## Current Model Performance
The current model shows several limitations in capturing the dynamics of the coral-COTS system:
1. The fast_pred comparison shows the model fails to capture the high variability in fast-growing coral populations, particularly missing the extreme peaks around 1990.
2. The slow_pred comparison shows the model underestimates peaks in slow-growing coral cover.
3. The cots_pred comparison shows reasonable tracking of trends but misses some of the rapid population changes.

## Ecological Improvement: Coral Competition for Space
A key ecological mechanism missing from the current model is explicit competition between fast and slow-growing corals for limited reef space. In coral reef ecosystems, space is a critical limiting resource, and different coral types compete for available substrate. 

The current model treats each coral type independently with separate carrying capacities, but in reality, they share the same physical space. Fast-growing branching corals can quickly colonize open space but may be outcompeted by slow-growing massive corals in the long term under stable conditions.

## Implementation
I've modified the model to include:
1. A shared carrying capacity representing total available reef space
2. Asymmetric competition coefficients between coral types
3. Modified growth equations that account for both intra- and inter-specific competition

This approach better represents the ecological reality where:
- Fast-growing corals can rapidly colonize open space after disturbances
- Slow-growing corals are more competitive in stable conditions
- Total coral cover is constrained by available substrate

The competition mechanism is implemented through:
- A space limitation term that reduces growth as total coral cover approaches the maximum possible cover
- Competition coefficients that represent the asymmetric effects of each coral type on the other
- A simplified mathematical formulation to ensure numerical stability

The model now captures the fundamental ecological process of competition for space while maintaining computational stability. The asymmetric competition coefficients allow the model to represent the different competitive strategies of fast and slow-growing corals, which should improve its ability to capture the observed dynamics in the time series data.
