This model simulates Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impacts on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population growth influenced by:
   - Density-dependent reproduction and mortality
   - Immigration events (representing larval influx)
   - Temperature effects on survival and reproduction

2. Coral community dynamics with two functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)

3. Ecological interactions:
   - COTS preferential predation on fast-growing corals
   - Coral growth rates dependent on cover (space limitation)
   - Temperature stress effects on coral mortality
   - Feedback between coral availability and COTS survival

The model aims to predict COTS outbreak patterns and subsequent impacts on coral community composition, providing insights for reef management strategies. It incorporates environmental forcing (sea surface temperature) and immigration events as external drivers of the system.
