Model Improvement: Density-Dependent COTS Predation Efficiency

Current Model Assessment:
The current model shows several discrepancies between historical and modeled data:
1. For fast-growing coral, the model fails to capture the sharp peaks and troughs, particularly around 1985-1990 and 1992-1995.
2. For COTS predictions, the model underestimates population peaks in the early 1990s and doesn't capture the variability in the historical data.
3. For slow-growing coral, the model significantly underestimates the major peak around 1990-1991.

Ecological Improvement:
I've implemented density-dependent predation efficiency for COTS. In real coral reef ecosystems, COTS feeding behavior changes with population density:
- At low densities, COTS tend to completely consume preferred coral species
- At high densities, feeding efficiency decreases due to:
  a) Interference competition between individuals
  b) Reduced time spent feeding as movement and mate-finding increase
  c) Suboptimal foraging as preferred coral species are depleted

Implementation:
I've added a density-dependent modifier to the functional response equations that reduces predation efficiency as COTS density increases. This creates a feedback mechanism where:
- Low COTS densities have high per-capita predation rates
- High COTS densities have reduced per-capita predation rates

This modification should better capture:
1. The survival of corals during COTS outbreaks (explaining some of the peaks in coral cover)
2. The population dynamics of COTS as food resources change
3. The indirect pathway where COTS density affects its own population growth through resource depletion

The new parameter 'cots_interference' represents the strength of this density-dependent interference effect.

Technical Implementation Note:
The model has been simplified to improve numerical stability during optimization while preserving the ecological mechanisms. I've used fmax() and fmin() functions to ensure values stay within reasonable bounds, and simplified some of the mathematical expressions to reduce the risk of numerical issues.
