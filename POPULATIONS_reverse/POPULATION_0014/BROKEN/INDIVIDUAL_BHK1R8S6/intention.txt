# Model Improvement: Coral Recovery Delay Mechanism

## Current Model Performance
Looking at the comparison plots between historical and modeled data, I observed several issues:

1. **COTS Population Dynamics**: The model captures the general trend but misses some of the sharp peaks and rapid declines seen in the historical data around 1990-1995.

2. **Slow-Growing Coral Cover**: The model significantly underestimates the peaks in slow-growing coral cover (around 1990) and doesn't capture the rapid changes in coverage.

3. **Fast-Growing Coral Cover**: The model smooths out the fluctuations too much, missing important dynamics in the historical data.

## Ecological Mechanism Added: Recovery Delay After Predation

I've implemented a recovery delay mechanism to better represent the ecological reality of coral reef systems after COTS predation events. This addresses a key feedback mechanism missing in the original model.

### Ecological Justification:

When COTS feed on corals, they don't just reduce the current coral cover - they also damage the reef substrate and create conditions that temporarily inhibit coral recovery:

1. **Substrate Modification**: COTS leave behind damaged areas that require time to become suitable for new coral settlement.

2. **Algal Colonization**: After COTS predation, algae often colonize the damaged areas, further delaying coral recovery.

3. **Community Structure Disruption**: Predation events disrupt the ecological community structure, affecting coral recruitment processes.

4. **Differential Recovery Rates**: Slow-growing and fast-growing corals have different recovery trajectories after predation events.

### Implementation Details:

1. Added two new parameters:
   - `recovery_delay_slow`: Time required for slow-growing corals to recover from predation (3.5 years)
   - `recovery_delay_fast`: Time required for fast-growing corals to recover from predation (1.8 years)

2. Created tracking variables to accumulate predation impacts over time with exponential decay based on the recovery delay parameters.

3. Modified the coral growth equations to include recovery inhibition factors that reduce growth rates proportionally to recent predation history.

### Expected Improvements:

1. **Better Representation of Peaks and Crashes**: The model should now better capture the sharp peaks and subsequent crashes in both coral and COTS populations.

2. **Delayed Recovery Dynamics**: The model will show more realistic recovery patterns after COTS outbreaks.

3. **Improved Fit to Historical Data**: The model should better match the historical patterns, especially the rapid changes in coral cover.

4. **More Realistic System Behavior**: The model now incorporates an important ecological feedback mechanism that is known to occur in real coral reef systems.

This improvement maintains the core structure of the original model while adding a biologically meaningful mechanism that should improve its ability to capture the complex dynamics of the coral-COTS system.
