# Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Coral Growth Response

## Current Model Assessment
Based on the comparison plots, the current model shows significant discrepancies between predicted and historical data:

1. **Slow-growing corals**: The model predicts a steady linear increase, while historical data shows high variability with peaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

2. **Fast-growing corals**: The model predicts continuous growth far exceeding historical values, which actually show a declining trend after the mid-1990s.

3. **COTS population**: The model captures some of the outbreak dynamics but misses the timing and magnitude of key population fluctuations.

## Ecological Improvement
I've implemented a more realistic temperature-dependent growth response for corals using a Gaussian thermal performance curve, which is widely supported in coral reef ecology literature. This approach addresses several key ecological mechanisms:

1. **Environmental modifiers**: Temperature is a critical environmental factor affecting coral growth and survival. The previous model used simple linear temperature effects, which doesn't capture the non-linear thermal responses of corals.

2. **Differential thermal tolerance**: I've added parameters for thermal tolerance ranges that differ between slow and fast-growing corals. Fast-growing branching corals (like Acropora) are typically more sensitive to temperature stress than slow-growing massive corals (like Porites).

3. **Resource limitations**: The Gaussian response curve creates a physiological limitation where coral growth is optimal at a specific temperature and declines as temperature deviates from this optimum.

4. **Feedback mechanisms**: Temperature effects create an indirect feedback pathway where changing temperatures can alter the competitive dynamics between coral types and their vulnerability to COTS predation.

## Implementation Details
The new model uses a Gaussian function to model temperature effects:
- Temperature effect = exp(-((T - Topt)²)/(2 × variance))

Where:
- T is the current sea surface temperature
- Topt is the optimal temperature for coral growth
- Variance is set to fixed values (4.0 for slow-growing corals, 2.0 for fast-growing corals)

This creates a bell-shaped response where:
- Growth is maximized at the optimal temperature
- Growth decreases symmetrically as temperature deviates from the optimum
- The rate of decrease is faster for fast-growing corals than for slow-growing corals

The different variance values for slow vs. fast-growing corals (4.0 vs. 2.0) reflect the ecological reality that massive slow-growing corals generally have broader thermal tolerance than branching fast-growing corals.

This improvement should better capture the observed fluctuations in coral cover, particularly the decline in fast-growing corals during potential warming periods, while allowing slow-growing corals to maintain more stable populations.
