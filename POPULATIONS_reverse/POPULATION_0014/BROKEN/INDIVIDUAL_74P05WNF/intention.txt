# Model Improvement: Coral Recovery Resilience

## Current Model Performance
Looking at the comparison plots between historical and modeled data, I observe:
1. The model struggles to capture the high variability in fast-growing coral cover, particularly missing peaks and troughs
2. For slow-growing coral, the model smooths out the dynamics too much, missing important fluctuations
3. COTS predictions follow general trends but miss important outbreak peaks

## Ecological Mechanism Added: Coral Recovery Resilience
I've implemented a coral recovery resilience mechanism that accounts for the ability of coral to recover more effectively when at lower densities. This is a well-documented ecological phenomenon where:

1. After disturbances that reduce coral cover, the remaining coral colonies often experience enhanced growth rates
2. Lower density means reduced competition for space, light, and nutrients
3. Surviving coral fragments can rapidly recolonize available substrate

This is implemented as a density-dependent recovery modifier that increases coral growth rates when cover is below a threshold percentage of carrying capacity. The effect is stronger for fast-growing corals (which are typically better colonizers) than for slow-growing corals.

## Expected Improvements
This change should:
1. Better capture the rapid recovery of coral populations after disturbances
2. Improve the model's ability to represent the oscillatory dynamics seen in the historical data
3. Create more realistic feedback between coral cover and COTS population dynamics

The new parameters (recovery_threshold_fast, recovery_threshold_slow, recovery_multiplier_fast, recovery_multiplier_slow) control when and how strongly this recovery effect manifests for each coral type.
