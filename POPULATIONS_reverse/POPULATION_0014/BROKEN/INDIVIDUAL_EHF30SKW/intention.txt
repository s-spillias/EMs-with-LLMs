# Ecological Model Improvement: Nutrient-Mediated COTS Outbreak Dynamics

## Current Model Performance Assessment
Looking at the comparison plots between historical and modeled data:

1. **Slow-growing coral (slow_pred)**: The model captures the general trend but misses the high variability in historical data, particularly the sharp peak around 1990.

2. **Crown-of-thorns starfish (cots_pred)**: The model significantly underestimates the major outbreak peaks in 1990 and 1993, instead producing a smoothed response.

3. **Fast-growing coral (fast_pred)**: The model captures the general trend but misses the high-frequency variations, especially the sharp decline after 2000.

## Ecological Improvement: Nutrient-Enhanced COTS Reproduction
A key ecological mechanism missing from the current model is the relationship between nutrient levels (particularly during rainfall/runoff events) and COTS reproduction success. Research has shown that phytoplankton blooms triggered by nutrient-rich terrestrial runoff can dramatically increase COTS larval survival, leading to population outbreaks.

I've implemented a nutrient-mediated reproduction enhancement for COTS based on sea surface temperature (SST) as a proxy for rainfall/runoff events. This creates an indirect pathway where:
1. Higher SST correlates with increased rainfall in tropical regions
2. Increased rainfall leads to greater terrestrial runoff and nutrient input
3. Higher nutrients enhance phytoplankton blooms
4. Phytoplankton blooms increase COTS larval survival and recruitment

This mechanism creates a more realistic feedback loop where environmental conditions can trigger COTS outbreaks through enhanced reproduction, which then causes coral decline through predation. The implementation uses a sigmoidal response function to model the threshold effect of nutrient availability on COTS reproduction.

This improvement should better capture the episodic nature of COTS outbreaks observed in the historical data, particularly the sharp peaks that the current model fails to reproduce.
