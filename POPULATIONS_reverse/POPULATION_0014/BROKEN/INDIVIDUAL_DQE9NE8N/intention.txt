# Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Predation Efficiency

## Current Model Performance
Looking at the comparison plots between modeled and historical data:
1. The slow-growing coral model shows a linear increase while historical data shows high variability and peaks
2. The fast-growing coral model shows a steady increase far exceeding historical values
3. The COTS model captures some peaks but misses the timing and magnitude of outbreaks

## Ecological Mechanism Added
I've implemented temperature-dependent predation efficiency for Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS). In coral reef ecosystems, temperature significantly affects COTS metabolism and feeding behavior. During warmer periods (especially approaching but not exceeding their thermal optimum), COTS become more active predators with higher feeding rates.

This mechanism creates an important feedback loop:
- As temperatures increase toward COTS thermal optimum, their predation efficiency increases
- This leads to more coral consumption during warmer periods
- The increased feeding provides more resources for COTS population growth
- This can trigger or amplify COTS outbreaks during favorable temperature conditions

## Implementation
I've added a temperature-dependent modifier to the predation rates using a Gaussian-like function:
1. Predation efficiency peaks at the optimal temperature for COTS (28°C)
2. Efficiency decreases as temperature deviates from this optimum
3. The exponential function exp(-temp_pred_effect * (temp_diff)²) creates a smooth, biologically realistic response

## Expected Improvements
This change should:
- Better capture the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks
- Create more realistic dynamics in coral cover in response to temperature fluctuations
- Improve the model's ability to predict COTS outbreaks under changing temperature regimes
- Generate more realistic coral cover trajectories that respond to both COTS predation and temperature

## Technical Notes
I've simplified the model implementation to improve numerical stability while preserving the key ecological mechanism. The exponential formulation for temperature effects provides better numerical properties than the previous quadratic approach.
