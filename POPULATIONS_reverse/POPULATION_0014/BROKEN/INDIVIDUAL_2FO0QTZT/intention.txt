This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population growth with density-dependent regulation
2. COTS predation on two coral functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)
3. Differential coral vulnerability, with preference for fast-growing Acropora
4. Coral growth dynamics with competition between coral types
5. Environmental influences:
   - Sea surface temperature (SST) effects on coral growth and mortality
   - COTS immigration events that can trigger outbreaks
6. Feedback mechanisms where coral availability limits COTS population

The model aims to predict COTS outbreak patterns and subsequent coral community responses, providing insights for reef management strategies. Time series data on COTS abundance, coral cover percentages, sea surface temperature, and COTS immigration rates are used to parameterize and validate the model.
