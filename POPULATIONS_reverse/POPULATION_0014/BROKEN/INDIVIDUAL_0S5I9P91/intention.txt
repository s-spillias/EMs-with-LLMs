# Model Improvement: Resource Limitation and Temperature Effects

## Current Model Performance
Based on the comparison plots, the current model has several limitations:

1. **Slow-growing corals**: The model predicts a steady linear increase, while historical data shows high variability with peaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

2. **Fast-growing corals**: The model predicts continuous growth far exceeding historical values, which show a general declining trend.

3. **COTS population**: The model captures some peaks but misses the timing and magnitude of outbreaks.

## Ecological Improvements Implemented

I've implemented two key ecological mechanisms to better capture the system dynamics:

1. **Resource Limitation for COTS Growth**
   - Added a sigmoid function that limits COTS population growth when coral cover falls below a threshold
   - This represents a critical ecological feedback where predator populations are constrained by prey availability
   - The sigmoid function (1/(1+exp(-sensitivity*(coral-threshold)))) creates a smooth transition between resource-limited and resource-abundant conditions

2. **Temperature-Dependent Processes**
   - Implemented bell-shaped temperature response curves for both COTS and coral growth
   - This captures the ecological reality that both COTS and corals have optimal temperature ranges
   - Temperature effects are modeled as: exp(-(T-Topt)²/(2*beta²))
   - This allows for reduced growth/predation at both high and low temperature extremes

## Ecological Justification

These improvements address key ecological mechanisms:

1. **Feedback Mechanisms**: The resource limitation creates a negative feedback loop where COTS populations naturally decline when coral cover is reduced, preventing complete coral elimination and allowing for recovery cycles.

2. **Environmental Modifiers**: Temperature is a critical environmental driver in coral reef systems, affecting both coral growth and COTS metabolism/feeding rates.

3. **Indirect Pathways**: The model now captures how temperature can indirectly affect the coral-COTS relationship by differentially impacting their physiological processes.

These changes should help the model better capture the cyclical nature of COTS outbreaks and the subsequent coral recovery periods observed in the historical data, rather than the continuous trends shown in the current predictions.
