# Model Improvement: Incorporating Coral Competition Dynamics

## Current Model Assessment
Based on the comparison plots, the current model shows several limitations:

1. For slow-growing corals, the model fails to capture the high variability seen in the historical data, particularly missing the peaks around 1985, 1988, and 1990.
2. For fast-growing corals, the model smooths out the fluctuations seen in the historical data, especially during the 1980s and early 1990s.
3. For COTS populations, the model misses some of the sharp peaks and troughs, particularly around 1990-1992.

These discrepancies suggest that important ecological mechanisms are missing from the current model formulation.

## Ecological Improvement: Coral Competition
I've added interspecific competition between slow-growing and fast-growing corals, which is a critical ecological process in coral reef ecosystems. In nature, corals compete intensely for limited space on the reef substrate, and this competition can significantly influence their growth rates and responses to disturbances.

### Key Mechanisms Added:
1. **Competitive Interference**: Slow-growing and fast-growing corals inhibit each other's growth through direct competition for space and resources.
2. **Modified Carrying Capacity**: The effective carrying capacity of each coral type is reduced by the presence of the other type, creating a dynamic equilibrium that depends on the current state of the system.

### Implementation Details:
- Added two new parameters: `comp_slow_on_fast` and `comp_fast_on_slow` to represent the competitive effects.
- Modified the logistic growth equations to include effective carrying capacities that depend on the abundance of competing coral types.
- Used the formula: K_effective = K_original / (1 + competition_coefficient * competitor_abundance / competitor_K)

This formulation creates a more realistic representation of coral dynamics where:
- As one coral type increases, it reduces the growth potential of the other type
- The system can exhibit more complex dynamics including alternative stable states
- The response to disturbances (like COTS outbreaks) becomes more nuanced and potentially more variable

### Expected Improvements:
1. More variable coral dynamics that better match the historical fluctuations
2. More realistic recovery patterns following COTS outbreaks
3. Better representation of the system's response to environmental changes
4. Improved ability to capture the peaks and troughs observed in the historical data

This improvement maintains the core structure of the model while adding an ecologically meaningful mechanism that is well-supported by coral reef literature. The competition coefficients are parameterized based on literature values for coral competition and can be further refined through model fitting.
