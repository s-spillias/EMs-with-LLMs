# Ecological Model Improvement: Coral Recovery Inhibition by COTS

## Current Model Performance
Looking at the comparison plots between historical and modeled data:

1. Fast-growing coral prediction: The model generally captures the trend but misses some peaks and troughs, particularly around 1990-1995 where there's a significant discrepancy.

2. Slow-growing coral prediction: The model consistently underestimates the peaks in slow-growing coral cover, especially the major peak around 1990.

3. COTS prediction: The model fails to capture the sharp peaks in COTS population around 1990-1995, and generally underestimates COTS population variability.

## Ecological Mechanism Added
I've implemented a "coral recovery inhibition" mechanism that represents how COTS not only consume coral but also damage the reef structure and inhibit coral recovery through:

1. Physical damage to reef substrate during feeding
2. Creation of algal-dominated areas that slow coral recruitment
3. Persistent ecological effects after COTS outbreaks

This is implemented as a density-dependent inhibition factor that reduces coral growth rates based on recent COTS abundance. The effect has a time lag and persists even after COTS numbers decline, representing the ecological memory of the system.

## Expected Improvements
This change should:
1. Better capture the delayed recovery of corals after COTS outbreaks
2. Improve the model's ability to represent the ecosystem's hysteresis (different recovery vs. decline trajectories)
3. Create more realistic boom-bust cycles in the coral-COTS dynamics
4. Better match the historical patterns, particularly the slow recovery periods after major COTS outbreaks

The new parameter (cots_inhibition) represents the strength of this inhibitory effect on coral recovery, with ecological justification from studies showing persistent reef damage following COTS outbreaks.
