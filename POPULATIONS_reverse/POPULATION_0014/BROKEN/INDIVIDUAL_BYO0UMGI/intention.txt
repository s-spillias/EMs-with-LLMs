This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population growth influenced by sea surface temperature (SST) and immigration events
2. Selective predation by COTS on two coral functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae spp. and Porites spp.)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.)
3. Differential coral growth and recovery rates between coral functional groups
4. Temperature-dependent coral bleaching effects
5. Feedback mechanisms where coral cover affects COTS survival and reproduction

The model aims to predict COTS outbreak patterns and subsequent impacts on coral community composition, providing insights for reef management strategies. The model uses annual time steps and incorporates both density-dependent processes and environmental forcing variables.
