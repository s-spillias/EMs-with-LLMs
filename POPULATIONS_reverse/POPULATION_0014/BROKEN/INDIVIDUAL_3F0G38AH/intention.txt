This model simulates Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impacts on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population growth influenced by:
   - Density-dependent reproduction and mortality
   - Immigration events (representing larval influx from external sources)
   - Temperature effects on survival and reproduction

2. Coral community dynamics with two functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)

3. Ecological interactions:
   - COTS preferential predation on different coral types
   - Coral growth rates dependent on cover and environmental conditions
   - Feedback mechanisms where coral availability affects COTS survival

4. Environmental drivers:
   - Sea surface temperature (SST) effects on both COTS and coral dynamics
   - Extreme temperature events causing coral mortality

The model aims to predict COTS outbreak patterns and subsequent impacts on coral community composition, providing insights for reef management strategies.
