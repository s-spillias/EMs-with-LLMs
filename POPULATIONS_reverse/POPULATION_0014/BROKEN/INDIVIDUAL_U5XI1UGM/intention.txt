# Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent COTS Feeding Rate

## Current Model Performance
Based on the comparison plots between modeled and historical data:

1. **COTS Population (cots_pred)**: The model underestimates the peaks in COTS population around 1990-1995, and doesn't capture the variability well in the 1980s.

2. **Slow-Growing Coral (slow_pred)**: The model significantly underestimates the peaks in slow-growing coral cover, particularly the major peak around 1990.

3. **Fast-Growing Coral (fast_pred)**: The model captures some patterns but misses key fluctuations, particularly around 1985-1990.

## Ecological Improvement
I've implemented a temperature-dependent feeding rate for Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS), which represents an important environmental modifier of predation processes. This improvement is ecologically justified for several reasons:

1. **Metabolic Theory**: Like many marine ectotherms, COTS feeding rates are temperature-dependent, with feeding activity typically increasing with temperature up to an optimal point, then declining at higher temperatures.

2. **Observed Patterns**: The historical data shows significant fluctuations in COTS and coral populations that aren't fully explained by the current model. Temperature-dependent feeding could help explain these patterns, especially during temperature anomalies.

3. **Feedback Mechanism**: This creates an important feedback loop where environmental conditions (temperature) affect COTS feeding behavior, which in turn affects coral populations and ultimately COTS population dynamics through food availability.

## Implementation Details
The improvement adds temperature-dependent feeding for COTS using three parameters:
- `temp_effect_cots`: Controls the magnitude of temperature's effect on feeding rate
- `temp_opt_cots`: The optimal temperature for COTS feeding activity
- `temp_tol_cots`: The temperature tolerance range for COTS

The feeding rate modifier is implemented as a Gaussian response curve, similar to the temperature effect on coral growth, but with a different optimal temperature and tolerance range. The formula is:
