# Model Improvement: Coral Recovery Inhibition by COTS

## Current Model Performance
The current model shows several discrepancies between historical and modeled data:

1. For COTS predictions (cots_pred), the model fails to capture the sharp peaks in the historical data around 1991-1993, instead showing a much smoother trajectory.

2. For slow-growing coral (slow_pred), the model underestimates the high values in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, and doesn't capture the rapid decline after the 1991 peak.

3. For fast-growing coral (fast_pred), the model smooths out the fluctuations seen in the historical data, particularly missing the sharp drops in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

## Ecological Mechanism Added
I've implemented a coral recovery inhibition mechanism that accounts for how COTS not only consume coral but also inhibit coral recovery through:

1. Physical damage to coral substrate during feeding
2. Release of chemical compounds that inhibit coral settlement and growth
3. Creation of algal-dominated areas after predation that slow coral recolonization

This mechanism is particularly important during and after COTS outbreaks, when even after COTS populations decline, coral recovery can be delayed due to these lingering effects.

## Implementation
I've added a recovery inhibition term that reduces coral growth rates based on recent COTS abundance. This creates a time-lagged effect where high COTS densities continue to suppress coral growth even as COTS populations decline.

The inhibition follows a sigmoidal function where:
- Low COTS densities have minimal impact on recovery
- As COTS density increases, inhibition increases rapidly
- At high COTS densities, inhibition approaches a maximum value

This better represents the ecological reality that COTS impacts on coral ecosystems extend beyond direct consumption.

## Expected Improvements
This change should:
1. Better capture the delayed recovery of corals after COTS outbreaks
2. Improve the model's ability to represent the sharp declines in coral cover
3. Create more realistic dynamics in the system by incorporating this important feedback mechanism

The inhibition strength is set to 0.7, meaning that at high COTS densities, coral recovery can be reduced by up to 70%, which aligns with observations of delayed recovery in heavily impacted reef systems.
