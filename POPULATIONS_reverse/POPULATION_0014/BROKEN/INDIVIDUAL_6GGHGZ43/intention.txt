# Coral-COTS Model Improvement: Coral Recovery Inhibition During COTS Outbreaks

## Current Model Performance Analysis
Based on the comparison plots, the current model shows several limitations:

1. **Fast-growing coral dynamics**: The model underestimates the extreme peaks and troughs in fast-growing coral cover, particularly around 1990-1992 when there was a major decline followed by recovery.

2. **COTS population dynamics**: The model captures the general pattern of COTS outbreaks but misses the timing and magnitude of some peaks, especially around 1990-1992.

3. **Slow-growing coral dynamics**: The model smooths out the fluctuations in slow-growing coral cover, missing some of the more rapid changes.

## Ecological Mechanism Added: Coral Recovery Inhibition During COTS Outbreaks

I've implemented a mechanism to represent how COTS outbreaks can inhibit coral recovery beyond direct predation. During high COTS densities, coral recovery is suppressed through:

1. **Indirect effects**: COTS create "feeding scars" that can become infected with pathogens or colonized by algae, inhibiting coral regrowth in those areas.

2. **Behavioral changes**: High COTS densities can alter the behavior of other reef organisms, including herbivores that normally facilitate coral recovery by controlling algae.

3. **Ecological feedback**: COTS-damaged areas may experience altered water chemistry and microbial communities that temporarily reduce coral recruitment success.

This mechanism is implemented as a density-dependent inhibition factor that reduces coral growth rates when COTS densities exceed a threshold. The inhibition increases non-linearly with COTS density, representing the cascading ecological effects that occur during severe outbreaks.

## Expected Improvements

This addition should:
1. Better capture the rapid declines in coral cover during COTS outbreaks
2. More accurately represent the delayed recovery of corals following outbreaks
3. Improve the model's ability to predict system dynamics during extreme events
4. Provide more realistic transitions between stable and disturbed states

The new parameter (cots_inhibit_threshold) represents the COTS density at which indirect inhibition effects begin to significantly impact coral recovery, based on ecological studies of COTS outbreak impacts.
