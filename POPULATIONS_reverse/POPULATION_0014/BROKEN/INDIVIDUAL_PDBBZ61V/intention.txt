# Model Improvement: Density-Dependent Predation Efficiency

## Current Model Assessment
Looking at the comparison plots between historical and modeled data, I observed several discrepancies:

1. The model fails to capture the magnitude of peaks in both slow and fast coral cover, particularly around 1990-1992.
2. The COTS population dynamics show smoother transitions than the historical data, missing some of the sharper changes.
3. The model generally underestimates the variability in the system, especially for slow-growing coral.

## Ecological Mechanism Added
I've implemented a density-dependent predation efficiency mechanism for the Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). This represents an important ecological feedback that is missing in the original model:

### Density-Dependent Predation Efficiency
In nature, COTS feeding behavior is known to vary with population density. At low densities, individual starfish may be less efficient at finding and consuming coral. At moderate densities, there can be benefits from group foraging where multiple individuals may overwhelm coral defenses. However, at very high densities, interference competition among COTS can reduce per-capita feeding rates.

The implemented function uses a simplified form of the Hill equation to model this relationship:
