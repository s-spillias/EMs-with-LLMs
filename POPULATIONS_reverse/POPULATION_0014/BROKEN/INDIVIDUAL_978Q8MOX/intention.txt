# Coral-COTS Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Predation

## Current Model Performance
Looking at the comparison plots between modeled and historical data:

1. **Slow-growing coral (slow_pred)**: The model shows a linear increasing trend while historical data shows high variability with peaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s, followed by a decline.

2. **Fast-growing coral (fast_pred)**: The model shows a steadily increasing trend that greatly overestimates the actual values, especially after 1990.

3. **COTS population (cots_pred)**: The model captures some of the outbreak dynamics but misses the timing and magnitude of peaks, particularly around 1990-1995.

## Ecological Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Predation Rates

The current model uses fixed predation rates for COTS on both coral types. However, in real coral reef ecosystems, COTS feeding behavior is known to be temperature-dependent. Higher temperatures can increase COTS metabolism and feeding rates up to a threshold, after which extreme temperatures may reduce feeding activity.

I've implemented a temperature-dependent predation function where:
1. COTS predation rates increase with temperature up to an optimal temperature
2. Beyond the optimal temperature, predation rates decline
3. This creates a dome-shaped response curve typical of many biological processes

This improvement is ecologically justified because:
- COTS are ectothermic organisms whose metabolic rates are directly influenced by water temperature
- Temperature affects both feeding behavior and digestion efficiency
- Extreme temperatures can cause physiological stress that reduces feeding activity
- This mechanism creates an important feedback between environmental conditions and predation pressure

By implementing this change, the model should better capture:
- The timing of COTS outbreaks in relation to temperature fluctuations
- The variable impact on coral populations during different temperature regimes
- The potential for climate change to alter predator-prey dynamics in coral reef ecosystems

This single change adds meaningful ecological complexity without overparameterizing the model, focusing on a well-documented mechanism in coral reef ecology.
