This model simulates Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impacts on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population growth with density-dependent regulation
2. Differential predation by COTS on two coral functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)
3. Coral growth dynamics with competition between coral types
4. Environmental influences:
   - Sea surface temperature (SST) effects on coral growth and mortality
   - COTS immigration events that can trigger outbreaks

The model incorporates key ecological processes including:
- Temperature-dependent coral growth and mortality
- Preferential feeding by COTS on fast-growing corals
- Density-dependent COTS population regulation
- Coral recovery dynamics following disturbance
- Immigration-driven COTS outbreak patterns

This model can be used to predict future COTS outbreaks, assess coral community resilience, and evaluate management interventions for controlling COTS populations on the Great Barrier Reef.
