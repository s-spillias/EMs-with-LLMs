# Model Improvement: Coral-COTS Feedback Mechanism

## Current Model Performance
Looking at the comparison plots between modeled and historical data:
1. The fast_pred model generally follows the trend of historical data but misses some of the variability
2. The slow_pred model significantly underestimates peaks in the historical data, particularly around 1990
3. The cots_pred model captures some dynamics but misses the timing and magnitude of outbreak peaks

## Ecological Mechanism Added
I've implemented a coral-facilitated COTS recruitment feedback mechanism. In reality, COTS larvae settlement success is enhanced by the presence of crustose coralline algae (CCA), which grows on healthy coral reefs. This creates an important feedback loop:
- Higher coral cover → more suitable substrate for CCA → increased COTS recruitment success
- This feedback can help explain the boom-bust cycles observed in COTS populations

## Implementation Details
1. Added a new parameter `coral_recruit_effect` that represents how coral cover enhances COTS recruitment
2. Modified the COTS population dynamics to include a recruitment term that depends on total coral cover
3. This creates a positive feedback loop where:
   - Higher coral cover increases COTS recruitment
   - Higher COTS populations reduce coral cover through predation
   - Reduced coral cover eventually limits COTS recruitment

This mechanism should better capture the observed dynamics where COTS outbreaks often follow periods of high coral cover, and the subsequent coral decline leads to COTS population crashes.

## Expected Improvements
- Better representation of the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks
- Improved capture of the boom-bust cycles in both COTS and coral populations
- More realistic representation of the ecological interactions in the system
