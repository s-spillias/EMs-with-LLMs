Model Improvements:

Added coral-dependent COTS population growth to better represent resource-consumer dynamics. The current model shows poor fit to population peaks around 1990, suggesting missing feedbacks between coral abundance and COTS population growth.

The modification creates a mechanistic link where COTS population growth rate increases with coral abundance (their food source) through a saturating (Holling Type II) response. This captures:
1. Enhanced COTS reproduction/survival when coral is abundant
2. Population limitation when coral is scarce
3. Realistic feedback between predator-prey dynamics

New parameter c_effect represents the maximum boost to COTS growth from coral abundance, while c_half determines how quickly this effect saturates with increasing coral cover.
