Model Performance Analysis and Improvements:

Current Model Fit:
- The model shows significant discrepancies between predicted and historical values, particularly in:
  1. Overestimating COTS populations during 1990-1995
  2. Missing sharp peaks in slow coral cover
  3. Not capturing the variability in fast coral cover well

Ecological Improvement:
Added coral density-dependent predation efficiency to better represent COTS feeding behavior:
- When total coral cover is low, COTS spend more energy searching for food
- Predation rates decrease non-linearly below a threshold coral cover
- This creates a stabilizing feedback: as corals become scarce, predation pressure reduces
- Should help prevent unrealistic COTS population growth when coral cover is low

The pred_threshold parameter (20%) represents the coral cover level where COTS feeding efficiency starts to decline significantly. This value is based on literature showing COTS tend to leave reefs when coral cover drops below 20-25%.

This modification should:
1. Improve COTS population predictions by limiting growth when food is scarce
2. Allow better coral recovery during low COTS periods
3. Create more realistic boom-bust cycles in the ecosystem
