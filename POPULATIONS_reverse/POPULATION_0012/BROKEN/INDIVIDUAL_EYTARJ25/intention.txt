Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model shows numerical instabilities in COTS population dynamics
- Sharp transitions in coral-dependent reproduction causing gradient issues
- Need for more robust handling of coral-COTS feedback

Ecological Improvement:
Modified coral-dependent COTS reproduction using a logistic response function:
1. Smoother transition between low/high coral states
2. More numerically stable than ratio-based functional response
3. Maintains ecological meaning of coral threshold effect on COTS reproduction
4. Better bounded between 0-1 for all coral values

This implementation should:
- Reduce numerical instabilities while maintaining biological realism
- Better capture the threshold-like effect of coral abundance on COTS reproduction
- Improve model stability without sacrificing ecological mechanisms
