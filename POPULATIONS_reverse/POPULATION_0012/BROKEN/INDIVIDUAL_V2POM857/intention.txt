Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows discrepancies between predicted and historical values, particularly in COTS predictions showing sustained high levels when coral cover is low.

Added food limitation mechanism:
- Implemented a modified ratio-based food limitation with a minimum baseline value
- Uses Holling Type III-like response curve that ensures:
  * Minimum growth rate (20%) even at very low coral cover to prevent complete population crashes
  * Smooth transition to maximum growth rate (100%) as coral cover increases
  * Numerically stable behavior across all coral cover values
- Creates a more realistic feedback where COTS population growth is reduced but not completely eliminated when coral food resources are depleted

The food limitation term now varies between 0.2 and 1.0, providing both ecological realism and numerical stability. This should better capture the persistence of COTS at low coral cover while still maintaining strong food limitation effects when coral is scarce.
