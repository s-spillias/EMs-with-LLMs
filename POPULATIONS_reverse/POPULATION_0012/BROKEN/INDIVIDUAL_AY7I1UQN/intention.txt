Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model shows significant discrepancies between predicted and historical values
- Fast coral predictions show excessive oscillations post-1990
- Slow coral predictions fail to capture the sharp declines seen in historical data
- COTS predictions show delayed responses to population changes

Ecological Improvement - Asymmetric Competition:
Added asymmetric competition between coral types to better represent ecological reality:
1. Fast-growing branching corals can overshadow slow-growing massive corals
2. Competition coefficient (beta_competition) represents the additional negative impact of fast corals on slow coral growth
3. This mechanism should help explain why slow corals often struggle to recover when fast corals are present
4. The asymmetric nature of competition (fast affecting slow more than vice versa) reflects real reef dynamics

Expected Improvements:
- More realistic coral community dynamics
- Better representation of slow coral decline patterns
- More stable fast coral predictions through feedback effects
- More accurate representation of coral community succession
