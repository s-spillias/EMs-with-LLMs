Looking at the comparison plots, I notice the model struggles to capture the sharp peaks in both coral and COTS populations around 1990-1991. One key ecological mechanism that could improve this is coral stress-mediated vulnerability to COTS predation.   
When corals are stressed (e.g., by high temperatures), they may become more susceptible to COTS predation.                                                                                                                                                     

I'll propose adding temperature-dependent attack rates, where COTS predation efficiency increases with temperature stress on corals. This requires:

 The comparison plots show the model struggles to capture sharp population changes, particularly around 1990-1991 where there are dramatic peaks in both COTS and coral populations. The model tends to smooth out these extreme events, suggesting it's missi

 Added temperature-dependent predation rates to capture coral stress-mediated vulnerability to COTS. When water temperatures deviate from optimal conditions, corals become more susceptible to COTS predation due to:

 - More dramatic population fluctuations during thermal stress events                                                                                                                                                                                          
 - Synergistic effects between temperature stress and predation pressure                                                                                                                                                                                       
 - Better alignment of modeled peaks with historical data                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 The temperature effect is implemented through a multiplier on attack rates that increases exponentially with temperature deviation from optimal conditions, based on established stress-response relationships in coral reef systems.

These changes introduce temperature-dependent predation while maintaining model parsimony. The exponential temperature effect on attack rates is a well-established form for biological rate modifications and should help capture the more extreme population 
fluctuations seen in the historical data.

The error occurs because temp_pred_effect needs to be declared as a PARAMETER. I'll fix this in model.cpp and clean up the duplicate parameters section in parameters.json.

These changes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

 1 Make the temperature effect more gradual and bounded                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 2 Prevent attack rates from going too close to zero                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 3 Reduce the temperature effect parameter to avoid numerical instability                                                                                                                                                                                      

The new temperature effect combines a linear term with a Gaussian envelope to keep the response bounded and smooth.

The error is due to incorrect usage of CppAD::max. Let's fix this by using a different approach to bound the values:

This change replaces the problematic max() function with a smooth approximation that ensures the temperature stress multiplier stays above 0.1 while maintaining differentiability.

These changes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

 1 Replace the Gaussian temperature stress with a bounded logistic function                                                                                                                                                                                    
 2 Switch to a robust likelihood function that's less sensitive to outliers                                                                                                                                                                                    
 3 Increase the observation error standard deviations                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 4 Add better numerical safeguards                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

The new temperature effect is more numerically stable while still capturing the biological relationship between temperature and predation rates.

Let's simplify the model to improve numerical stability. I'll make these changes:

These changes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

 1 Simplify the temperature effect to a linear response                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 2 Return to standard normal likelihood for better gradient properties                                                                                                                                                                                         
 3 Reduce the temperature effect parameter to avoid extreme values                                                                                                                                                                                             
 4 Keep the eps term for numerical stability                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

The model should now be more numerically stable while still capturing the key ecological mechanisms.
