Model Performance Analysis and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
The comparison plots show the model struggles to capture sharp population changes, particularly around 1990-1991 where there are dramatic peaks in both COTS and coral populations. The model tends to smooth out these extreme events, suggesting it's missing key mechanisms that drive rapid population changes.

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature-dependent predation rates to capture coral stress-mediated vulnerability to COTS. When water temperatures deviate from optimal conditions, corals become more susceptible to COTS predation due to:
1. Reduced defense capabilities in stressed corals
2. Increased COTS feeding activity at higher temperatures
3. Compromised coral tissue repair mechanisms

This modification should help capture:
- More dramatic population fluctuations during thermal stress events
- Synergistic effects between temperature stress and predation pressure
- Better alignment of modeled peaks with historical data

The temperature effect is implemented through a multiplier on attack rates that increases exponentially with temperature deviation from optimal conditions, based on established stress-response relationships in coral reef systems.
