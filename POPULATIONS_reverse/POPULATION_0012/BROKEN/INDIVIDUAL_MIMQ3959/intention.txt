Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows systematic underestimation of variability in coral cover, particularly for slow-growing corals, and doesn't fully capture COTS population peaks. The plots suggest that the model's predictions are too smooth compared to the observed data.

Adding temperature dependence to coral growth rates is ecologically justified because:
1. Corals are known to have optimal temperature ranges for growth and calcification
2. Temperature stress can significantly reduce coral growth rates
3. Different thermal tolerances between COTS and corals could help explain some of the observed temporal dynamics

The implementation uses a Gaussian response curve similar to the COTS temperature response, but with coral-specific parameters. This maintains model consistency while adding biological realism. The separate temperature optima and tolerances for corals vs COTS allows for differential responses to temperature changes, which could better capture the observed variability in the system.

Expected improvements:
- More realistic coral growth dynamics in response to temperature fluctuations
- Better representation of temporal variability in coral cover
- Improved capture of system dynamics during temperature extremes
- More mechanistic representation of coral-COTS interactions under varying environmental conditions
