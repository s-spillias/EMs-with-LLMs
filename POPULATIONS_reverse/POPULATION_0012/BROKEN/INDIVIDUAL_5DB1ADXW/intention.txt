Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Performance:
- The model underestimates the magnitude of COTS outbreaks during 1990-1995
- Coral decline predictions are smoother than observed patterns
- Temperature effects only influence COTS growth directly

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature stress effects on coral vulnerability to COTS predation because:
1. Thermal stress weakens coral defenses and immune responses
2. Stressed corals are more susceptible to COTS attacks
3. This creates an indirect pathway where temperature affects both COTS growth and predation efficiency
4. The mechanism can amplify COTS impacts during warm periods, potentially better capturing outbreak dynamics

The vulnerability_factor increases predation rates when temperature deviates from optimal, representing compromised coral defense mechanisms under thermal stress. This should improve the model's ability to capture:
- Stronger COTS impacts during thermally stressful periods
- More pronounced coral decline during combined thermal and COTS stress
- Better alignment of predicted outbreak timing with observations
