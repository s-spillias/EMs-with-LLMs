Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model underestimates the variability in coral cover, particularly for slow-growing corals
- Fast coral predictions show smoother trends than the observed fluctuations
- COTS predictions capture general trends but miss some peak densities

Ecological Improvement:
Added asymmetric competition between coral types through competition coefficients (beta_fast, beta_slow). This represents:
1. Direct competition for space and resources between coral types
2. Different competitive abilities (fast-growing corals typically being stronger competitors)
3. Mechanism for one coral type to suppress the other's growth

Expected Benefits:
- More realistic dynamics in coral cover fluctuations
- Better capture of competitive displacement between coral types
- Improved representation of community state shifts
