Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- Model shows numerical instabilities in gradient calculations
- Complex conditional expressions may be causing optimization issues
- Core ecological relationships are sound but need more stable implementation

Ecological Improvement:
Modified coral-dependent COTS reproduction using a Holling Type II functional form:
1. Changed coral_effect calculation to use total_coral/(K_coral + total_coral)
2. This creates a saturating response where:
   - Effect increases with coral cover but plateaus
   - Always positive and bounded between 1 and (1 + beta_cots)
   - Numerically stable due to denominator term
3. Maintains same ecological meaning but with better mathematical properties

The modification:
- Preserves the feedback between coral abundance and COTS reproduction
- Provides more stable gradients for optimization
- Uses a well-established functional form from ecological theory
