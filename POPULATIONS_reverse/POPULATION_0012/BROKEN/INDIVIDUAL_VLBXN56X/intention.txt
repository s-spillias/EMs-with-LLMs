Model Improvement: Density-dependent COTS Feeding Efficiency

Current Model Performance:
- Overpredicts COTS impacts during high density periods
- Misses some of the recovery dynamics in coral cover
- Shows unrealistic sustained high predation rates

Ecological Mechanism Added:
- Interference competition between COTS individuals
- As COTS density increases, per-capita feeding efficiency decreases
- This reflects real behavioral mechanisms like:
  * Physical interference between individuals
  * Reduced feeding time due to competitive interactions
  * Local depletion effects
  
Expected Improvements:
- More realistic predation impacts during COTS outbreaks
- Better capture of coral recovery phases
- Improved balance between COTS population growth and resource limitation
