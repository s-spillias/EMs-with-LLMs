Model Improvements:

1. Added temperature-dependent predation efficiency for COTS
- Scientific basis: COTS feeding rates are temperature-dependent, with optimal feeding occurring around 28Â°C
- Implementation: Modified attack rates (a_fast, a_slow) to vary with temperature using a Gaussian response curve
- Expected improvement: Better capture of COTS population peaks and resulting coral mortality during warm periods
- Current model limitations: Underestimates COTS outbreak impacts during warm periods
