Model Improvements - Coral Recovery Facilitation

The current model underestimates coral recovery dynamics, particularly for slow-growing corals. This may be because it misses important facilitation effects where existing coral cover enhances recovery through:
1. Increased larval supply from nearby colonies
2. Fragment generation and attachment
3. Enhanced settlement cues and substrate conditioning

The modified model includes a hump-shaped relationship between coral cover and recovery rate:
- Very low coral cover = reduced recovery due to limited propagule supply
- Intermediate coral cover = enhanced recovery through facilitation
- High coral cover = reduced recovery due to space limitation

This better represents the ecological reality of coral reef recovery dynamics while maintaining parsimony.
