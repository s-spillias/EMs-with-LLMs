Model Improvement: Density-dependent COTS Predation Efficiency

The current model shows unrealistic dynamics, particularly in:
1. Overestimating COTS population spikes
2. Not capturing the persistence of corals at low densities
3. Missing some key temporal patterns in coral cover

Added density-dependent predation efficiency where COTS feeding rates decrease at low coral densities. This represents:
- Increased search time when coral colonies are sparse
- Potential refuge effects for remaining corals
- More realistic predator-prey dynamics at low coral densities

The coral_thresh parameter (5%) represents a critical density below which COTS feeding efficiency drops significantly. This creates a stabilizing feedback that should:
- Prevent complete coral loss
- Generate more realistic COTS population dynamics
- Better match observed patterns of coral persistence and recovery

This mechanism is supported by field observations showing that COTS outbreaks have less impact when coral cover is already low, and theoretical work on predator functional responses under varying prey densities.
