Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Coral Vulnerability

Current Model Performance Issues:
- Misses some key dynamics in coral populations
- Tends to overestimate COTS impacts in some periods
- Doesn't capture full variability in coral cover

Ecological Mechanism Added:
Temperature stress increases coral vulnerability to COTS predation. This is implemented by making the attack rates (alpha) increase quadratically with deviation from optimal temperature. This represents:
1. Stressed corals have reduced defense capabilities
2. Higher metabolic demands of COTS at higher temperatures
3. Potential synergistic effects between temperature stress and predation

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of coral decline during heat stress periods
- More realistic predator-prey dynamics under varying conditions
- Improved representation of coral resilience in favorable conditions

This addition is justified by extensive literature showing how thermal stress compromises coral immune responses and increases susceptibility to predation and disease.
