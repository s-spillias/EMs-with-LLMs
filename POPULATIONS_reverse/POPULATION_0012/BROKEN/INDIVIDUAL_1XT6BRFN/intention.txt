This model improvement adds temperature dependence to coral growth rates, recognizing that both fast and slow-growing corals have optimal temperature ranges for growth and calcification. The current model underestimates population peaks and rapid changes, which may be partly due to not accounting for how temperature influences coral growth rates.

The modification adds temperature response curves for both coral types, similar to the existing COTS temperature response, but with coral-specific optimal temperatures and ranges. This better represents how coral growth varies with environmental conditions, which is especially important given the strong temperature effects on coral physiology and growth rates documented in the literature.

This change should improve the model's ability to capture:
1. More dynamic coral growth responses to temperature variation
2. Better representation of coral population peaks
3. More realistic coral recovery patterns following disturbance
