The current model implementation shows limitations in capturing the dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their impacts on coral populations, particularly during temperature-driven events around 1990. The model underestimates both the magnitude of COTS population peaks and the subsequent coral decline.

To improve ecological realism, I've added temperature-dependent predation efficiency. COTS feeding rates are known to increase with temperature up to an optimal level, similar to their growth response. This mechanism helps explain why COTS outbreaks can have such devastating impacts during warm periods, as both their population growth and their per-capita feeding rates are enhanced.

This modification should better capture:
1. The magnitude of coral decline during COTS outbreaks
2. The temperature-driven variability in COTS impacts
3. The coupling between environmental conditions and predation pressure
