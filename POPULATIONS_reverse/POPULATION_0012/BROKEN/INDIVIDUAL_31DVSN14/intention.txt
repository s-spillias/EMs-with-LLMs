Model Improvement: Asymmetric Coral Competition

The current model shows systematic underprediction of slow coral dynamics and overly smooth predictions for both coral types. This suggests missing ecological interactions between coral groups.

Added asymmetric competition where fast-growing branching corals can shade and inhibit slow-growing massive corals through a competition coefficient (beta_competition). This represents:

1. Light competition - fast corals growing over and shading slow corals
2. Space competition - vertical growth advantage of branching corals
3. Resource limitation - reduced nutrient/plankton access for shaded corals

The competition effect uses a saturating functional form (1/(1 + Î²F)) where:
- No fast coral (F=0) means no competition effect (term = 1)
- High fast coral cover reduces slow coral growth (term approaches 0)
- Effect is non-linear, matching ecological reality
- Only affects slow coral growth, as fast corals typically overtop slow ones

This mechanism should improve prediction of:
- Reduced slow coral growth when fast corals dominate
- More dynamic coral cover patterns through feedback effects
- Better capture of competitive displacement scenarios
