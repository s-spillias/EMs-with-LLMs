Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general trends but underestimates peak COTS densities around 1990
- Coral decline following COTS outbreaks is not as sharp as observed
- Recovery trajectories are smoother than historical data

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature-dependent predation efficiency because:
1. COTS feeding rates are known to vary with temperature
2. This may help capture outbreak dynamics better by:
   - Increasing predation during warm periods
   - Creating more pronounced coral decline during outbreaks
   - Better representing the timing of coral loss
3. The mechanism is well-supported by literature on COTS physiology
4. Adds minimal complexity while capturing an important environmental feedback

Expected Impact:
- More realistic COTS outbreak intensities
- Sharper coral decline during outbreaks
- Better timing of peak predation events
- Improved representation of temperature's role in reef dynamics
