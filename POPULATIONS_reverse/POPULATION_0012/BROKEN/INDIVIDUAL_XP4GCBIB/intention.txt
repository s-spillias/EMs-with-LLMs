This model incorporates coral abundance as a key driver of COTS population dynamics through a resource-dependent growth modifier. When coral cover is high, COTS reproduction and survival is enhanced, creating a positive feedback loop that can drive outbreak dynamics. Conversely, when coral cover is depleted, COTS population growth is suppressed, representing reduced reproductive success and survival due to food limitation.

This mechanism should help capture the observed sharp increases in COTS populations when coral is abundant, followed by population crashes when coral becomes depleted - a pattern visible in the historical data around 1990.
