Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model underestimates peak COTS populations and subsequent coral decline around 1990. Adding temperature-dependent COTS mortality better represents how environmental stress affects population dynamics. High temperatures can increase COTS mortality through physiological stress and disease susceptibility, while very low temperatures can also be lethal.

This mechanism creates an additional feedback between environmental conditions and COTS populations, helping to capture more realistic population crashes after outbreaks. The temperature-mortality relationship uses a U-shaped function where mortality increases at both temperature extremes beyond the optimal range.
