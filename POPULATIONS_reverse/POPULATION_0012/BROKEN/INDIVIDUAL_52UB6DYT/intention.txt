Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- Underestimates peak coral cover, especially for slow-growing corals around 1990
- Doesn't capture the magnitude of COTS outbreak events well
- Shows smoother dynamics than the observed data

Ecological Improvement:
Added density-dependent predation efficiency where COTS feeding rates increase with coral cover. This represents:
1. Increased prey detection at higher coral densities
2. More efficient predator movement between coral colonies when they are closer together
3. Potential aggregation of COTS in coral-rich areas

This mechanism creates positive feedback that can help explain:
- Rapid coral decline during COTS outbreaks
- More pronounced peaks and troughs in population dynamics
- Stronger coupling between coral density and COTS predation pressure

The d_coral parameter controls the strength of this density dependence, with literature support from studies of predator functional responses in coral reef systems.
