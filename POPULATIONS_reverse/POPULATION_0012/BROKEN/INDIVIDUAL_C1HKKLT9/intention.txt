Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model underestimates the variability in slow-growing coral cover, particularly during 1985-1995
- Fast coral predictions show smoother dynamics than observed
- COTS predictions capture general trends but miss some peak densities

Ecological Improvement - Asymmetric Competition:
Added beta_competition parameter to represent the stronger competitive effect of fast-growing corals on slow-growing corals. This modification:
1. Better represents the biological reality that fast-growing branching corals can overtop and shade slow-growing massive corals
2. Should improve prediction of slow coral decline during fast coral expansion periods
3. Maintains simple competition for fast corals while adding ecological realism for slow coral dynamics
4. May help explain some of the observed variability in slow coral cover through indirect effects

The asymmetric competition term affects space availability calculations differently for fast vs slow corals, with fast corals having a stronger negative effect on slow coral growth (beta_competition > 1).
