Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
The comparison plots show that the model currently:
- Overestimates COTS densities in the mid-1990s
- Does not capture the sharp transitions in coral cover well
- Shows systematic bias in predicting fast-growing coral cover

Ecological Improvement:
Added size-dependent vulnerability to COTS predation because:
1. Larger coral colonies are more resistant to COTS predation due to:
   - Greater physical size making complete consumption harder
   - More developed defense mechanisms
   - Better recovery from partial predation
2. This creates a negative feedback where established coral communities are more resilient
3. The sigmoid vulnerability function (using vuln_half and vuln_slope) represents a realistic transition from vulnerable small colonies to more resistant large colonies

Expected Benefits:
- More realistic predation dynamics
- Better representation of coral community resilience
- Improved prediction of recovery patterns
- More accurate capture of COTS impact variations

This modification adds ecological realism while maintaining model parsimony by using a simple sigmoid function to capture a complex size-dependent process.
