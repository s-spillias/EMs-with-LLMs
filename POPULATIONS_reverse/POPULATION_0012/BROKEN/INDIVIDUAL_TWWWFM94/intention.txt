Model Improvements - Simplified Temperature Effects

The model has been modified to focus temperature dependence on COTS population growth while keeping predation rates independent of temperature. This change:

1. Maintains the key mechanism of temperature-driven COTS outbreaks through population growth
2. Improves numerical stability by simplifying the predator-prey interactions
3. Better reflects that while COTS metabolism increases with temperature, their per-capita feeding rates may be more constrained by handling time and search efficiency

The attack rate on fast-growing coral has been increased to better capture the observed impacts during outbreak periods, while keeping the mechanism more tractable for parameter estimation.
