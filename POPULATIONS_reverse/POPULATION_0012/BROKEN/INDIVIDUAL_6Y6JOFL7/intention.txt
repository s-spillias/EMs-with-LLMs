Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general trends but underestimates variability in coral cover
- Fast-growing coral predictions are too smooth compared to observations
- Slow-growing coral predictions miss important dynamics, especially during 1985-1995

Ecological Improvement:
Added asymmetric competition between coral types to better represent:
1. Space competition where fast-growing branching corals can overtop and shade slow-growing massive corals
2. The differential ability of coral types to compete for resources
3. The natural succession dynamics in coral reef systems

The beta_competition parameter (>1) represents the stronger competitive effect of fast-growing corals on slow-growing corals compared to the reverse interaction. This should help capture:
- More variable coral cover dynamics
- Better representation of coral community shifts
- More realistic recovery patterns after disturbances

This addition maintains model parsimony while incorporating an important ecological mechanism that shapes coral reef community structure.
