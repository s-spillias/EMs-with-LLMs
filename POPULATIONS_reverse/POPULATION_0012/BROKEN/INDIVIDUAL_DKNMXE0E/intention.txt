Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- Underpredicts peaks in COTS outbreaks (especially around 1990)
- Does not fully capture variability in coral cover dynamics
- Shows smoother predictions compared to observed fluctuations

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature-dependent coral growth rates because:
1. Coral growth and calcification are highly temperature-sensitive
2. Temperature stress can reduce coral recovery potential
3. This mechanism could help explain observed variability in coral cover
4. Temperature effects on both COTS and coral create important indirect pathways

The new temperature response function for coral:
- Uses a Gaussian curve to model optimal temperature range
- Has coral-specific optimal temperature (26Â°C) based on literature
- Includes separate temperature tolerance range for corals
- Directly modifies both slow and fast coral growth rates

Expected improvements:
- Better capture of coral cover variability
- More realistic coral recovery dynamics
- Improved representation of temperature-mediated feedbacks
