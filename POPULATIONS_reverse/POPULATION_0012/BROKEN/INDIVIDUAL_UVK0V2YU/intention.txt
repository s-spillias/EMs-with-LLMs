This model incorporates temperature-dependent predation rates to better capture coral vulnerability to COTS under stress conditions. When water temperatures deviate from optimal coral conditions, the corals become more susceptible to COTS predation, represented by increased attack rates (alpha parameters).

This mechanism helps explain:
1. The rapid coral decline around 1990-1995 seen in the historical data
2. Different impacts on fast vs slow growing corals under temperature stress
3. Feedback between environmental conditions and predation pressure

The temperature effect on predation efficiency uses a Gaussian response curve centered on optimal coral temperature (different from optimal COTS temperature), creating an ecological trade-off between COTS survival and predation success.
