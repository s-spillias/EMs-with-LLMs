Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows systematic underestimation of variability in coral cover, particularly for slow-growing corals, and doesn't fully capture COTS population peaks. The plots reveal that the modeled trajectories are too smooth compared to the historical data.

Key improvement: Added temperature-dependent growth rates for both coral types.

Ecological justification:
1. Different coral species have distinct thermal optima and tolerances
2. Fast-growing branching corals tend to be more sensitive to temperature fluctuations than slow-growing massive corals
3. Temperature effects on coral growth create important feedbacks with COTS populations through available prey density

Expected improvements:
- Better capture of coral cover variability through temperature-mediated growth
- More realistic representation of differential responses between fast and slow-growing corals
- Improved feedback between environmental conditions and predator-prey dynamics

The new parameters are based on literature values for typical thermal tolerances of different coral growth forms, with fast-growing corals having slightly higher optimal temperatures but also wider tolerance ranges than slow-growing corals.
