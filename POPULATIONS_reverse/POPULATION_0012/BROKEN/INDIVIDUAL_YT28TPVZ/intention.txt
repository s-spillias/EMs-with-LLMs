Model Development Strategy:

Current focus: Establishing stable baseline dynamics
1. Simplified parameter handling to ensure numerical stability
2. Removed temperature-dependent coral vulnerability temporarily
3. Maintained core predator-prey interactions

Next steps once stability is achieved:
1. Reintroduce temperature effects on coral vulnerability
2. Fine-tune parameter bounds and transformations
3. Validate model behavior during extreme events

The current version provides a foundation for testing more complex ecological mechanisms
while ensuring the basic population dynamics are captured reliably.
