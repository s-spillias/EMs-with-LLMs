Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows systematic underestimation of population peaks, particularly evident in the 1990-1995 period across all three populations (COTS, fast coral, and slow coral). This suggests missing positive feedback mechanisms.

Added prey-dependent COTS growth modification:
- Uses a Holling Type II functional form to represent how coral abundance affects COTS population growth
- When coral is abundant (total_prey >> beta_prey * K_coral), the effect approaches 1
- When coral is scarce (total_prey << beta_prey * K_coral), COTS growth is reduced
- beta_prey parameter controls how strongly COTS depend on coral abundance

This mechanism better captures the ecological reality that COTS populations cannot thrive without sufficient coral prey, while also potentially allowing for more dramatic population peaks when conditions are favorable (high coral cover + optimal temperature).
