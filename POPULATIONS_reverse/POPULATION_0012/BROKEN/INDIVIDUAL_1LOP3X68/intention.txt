Model Improvements:

Added temperature-dependent coral vulnerability to COTS predation. When water temperatures deviate from coral optimal conditions, coral defenses are compromised, making them more susceptible to COTS predation. This mechanism helps explain rapid coral decline during thermal stress events and provides an indirect pathway between environmental conditions and predation efficiency.

The temperature effect on vulnerability uses a bounded multiplier (1.0 to 2.0) based on deviation from coral optimal temperature (24Â°C). The thermal_width parameter determines how quickly vulnerability increases with temperature deviation. This captures the ecological reality that stressed corals are more easily consumed by COTS while maintaining numerical stability.
