Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- Underpredicts peaks in COTS outbreaks (especially around 1990)
- Does not fully capture the magnitude of coral decline
- Shows smoother dynamics than observed data

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature-dependent feeding efficiency for COTS, implementing a key mechanism where:
- COTS feeding rates vary with temperature following a Gaussian response curve
- Attack rates are modified by temperature, separate from population growth effects
- This captures the physiological basis for increased predation during warmer periods

Expected Benefits:
1. Better representation of COTS outbreak intensities during warm periods
2. More realistic coral mortality during temperature-driven feeding peaks
3. Improved capture of the timing and magnitude of coral decline events

This modification is supported by literature showing that COTS feeding rates are temperature-dependent, with optimal feeding occurring around 27Â°C.
