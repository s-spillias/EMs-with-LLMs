Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model underpredicts sharp declines in coral cover seen in historical data
- COTS population peaks are not well-aligned with coral decline patterns
- Recovery trajectories are too gradual compared to observations

Ecological Improvement:
Added density-dependent attack rates to represent COTS aggregation behavior:
- COTS are known to aggregate and feed more efficiently at higher coral densities
- Attack rates now increase with total coral cover via q_agg parameter
- This better captures the rapid coral decline phases seen in data
- Mechanism is well-documented in literature on COTS feeding ecology
- Should improve model's ability to represent outbreak dynamics

The modification maintains model parsimony while incorporating an important ecological mechanism that influences system dynamics.
