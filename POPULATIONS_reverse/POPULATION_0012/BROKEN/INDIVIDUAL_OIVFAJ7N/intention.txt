Model Improvement: Numerically Stable Fixed Preference Predation

The model implements a simplified and numerically stable predation mechanism with fixed preferences to capture COTS feeding behavior. The implementation uses complementary preference values (0.7 for fast-growing, 0.3 for slow-growing corals) and ensures positive values throughout calculations.

Key improvements:
1. Direct use of fixed preference values without intermediate calculations
2. Additional safeguards against division by zero
3. Simplified predation terms while maintaining ecological realism
4. Removal of unnecessary intermediate variables

The preference values (0.7/0.3) reflect COTS' tendency to feed more heavily on fast-growing branching corals while maintaining some predation pressure on slow-growing massive corals. The simplified formulation prioritizes numerical stability while preserving the essential predator-prey dynamics.
