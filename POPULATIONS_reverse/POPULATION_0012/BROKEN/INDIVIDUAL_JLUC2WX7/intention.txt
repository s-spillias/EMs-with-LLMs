Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The fast coral predictions show a smoother decline than the historical data, missing sharp drops
- The slow coral predictions don't capture the high variability seen in observations
- COTS predictions capture general trends but miss some peak amplitudes

Ecological Improvement - Temperature Stress Effects:
Added temperature-dependent modification of coral growth rates because:
1. Corals are highly sensitive to temperature stress
2. Fast-growing branching corals (e.g., Acropora) are typically more sensitive to temperature than slow-growing massive corals
3. Temperature stress can cause sudden drops in coral cover as seen in the historical data
4. Different thermal tolerances between coral types help explain their different response patterns

The new temperature stress terms use a Gaussian response curve where:
- Growth is optimal at temp_opt_coral (26°C)
- Fast-growing corals have narrower tolerance (temp_tol_coral_fast = 1.8°C)
- Slow-growing corals have wider tolerance (temp_tol_coral_slow = 2.5°C)

This modification should better capture:
- Sharp declines during temperature anomalies
- Different sensitivities between coral types
- More realistic variability in coral cover
