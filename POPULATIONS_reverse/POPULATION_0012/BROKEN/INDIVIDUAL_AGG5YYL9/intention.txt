Model Improvements:

The model now includes density-dependent coral growth that accounts for:
1. Space limitation effects at high coral cover
2. Linear decrease in growth rate with increasing coral density
3. Bounded predation to prevent negative coral cover

This simpler formulation maintains ecological realism while improving numerical stability.
