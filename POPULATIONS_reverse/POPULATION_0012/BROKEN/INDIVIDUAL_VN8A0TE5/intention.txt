Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general trends but misses sharp population peaks around 1990
- Predation rates appear too constant despite varying environmental conditions
- Coral decline patterns suggest missing stress-related vulnerability

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature-dependent coral vulnerability to predation because:
1. Stressed corals have reduced defense capabilities
2. Temperature stress compromises coral immune responses
3. COTS may preferentially attack stressed corals
4. This mechanism can create positive feedback during heat stress events

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of population peaks during stress events
- More realistic predator-prey dynamics under varying conditions
- Improved representation of coral vulnerability during thermal stress
