Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general trends but misses important dynamics, particularly:
- Underestimates peaks in slow-growing coral populations around 1990
- Smooths out natural variability in coral population responses
- Does not fully capture the recovery patterns after disturbances

Ecological Improvement - Coral Facilitation:
Added facilitation effects where fast-growing corals enhance slow coral growth through:
- Providing stable settlement substrate
- Creating protective habitat structure
- Moderating local environmental conditions

This mechanism is implemented via a facilitation term (f_facilitation) that increases
slow coral growth rate based on fast coral cover. The effect scales with relative
fast coral abundance (fast_pred/K_coral) to maintain biological realism.

Expected improvements:
- Better capture of slow coral recovery dynamics
- More realistic representation of coral community interactions
- Improved prediction of population peaks through positive feedback effects
