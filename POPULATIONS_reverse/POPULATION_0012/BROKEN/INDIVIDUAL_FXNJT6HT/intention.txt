Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general declining trends in both coral types
- However, it underestimates the variability in coral cover, particularly for slow-growing corals
- The COTS predictions show smoother dynamics than observed

Ecological Improvement - Asymmetric Competition:
The original model used simple total cover competition, treating fast and slow-growing corals as equivalent competitors. This doesn't reflect reality where:
- Fast-growing branching corals can overtop and shade slow-growing massive corals
- Slow-growing massive corals have less vertical impact on fast-growing species
- This asymmetry affects recovery patterns and community composition

Implementation:
- Added alpha_fast_slow (1.5) and alpha_slow_fast (0.5) competition coefficients
- Modified growth equations to incorporate asymmetric effects
- Values based on literature showing stronger competitive effects of fast-growing species

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of differential recovery patterns between coral types
- More realistic representation of community dynamics
- Improved fit to observed variability in coral cover
