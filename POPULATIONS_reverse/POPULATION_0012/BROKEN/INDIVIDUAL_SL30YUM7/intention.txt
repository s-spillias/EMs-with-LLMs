Model Performance Analysis and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general trends but misses sharp population peaks around 1990
- Predation rates appear too constant despite varying environmental conditions
- Temperature only affects COTS growth, not their predation efficiency

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature-dependent coral stress effect on predation rates because:
1. Stressed corals are more vulnerable to predation
2. High temperatures reduce coral defense mechanisms
3. This creates an important feedback loop where temperature affects both COTS growth and predation efficiency

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of population peaks during high temperature periods
- More realistic predator-prey dynamics under stress conditions
- Improved representation of temperature's multiple ecological effects

The new parameters (stress_threshold, stress_effect) are based on literature values for coral thermal stress responses and documented increases in predation susceptibility under stress conditions.
