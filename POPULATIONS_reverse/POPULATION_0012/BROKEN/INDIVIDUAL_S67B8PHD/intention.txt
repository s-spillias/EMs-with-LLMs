Model Performance Analysis and Improvements:

Current Fit Assessment:
- Previous temperature response functions showed gradient instabilities
- Complex exponential terms created numerical difficulties
- Need more robust bounded responses

Ecological Improvement:
Modified temperature effects to use rational functions:
1. Temperature effect now uses 1/(1 + x^2) form that is:
   - Naturally bounded between 0 and 1
   - Symmetric around optimal temperature
   - Smoother gradients than exponential
2. Predation terms simplified to:
   - Use direct competition between coral types
   - Include numerical safeguard (eps)
   - Maintain Type II functional response structure

These modifications:
- Keep the same ecological meaning but with better numerical properties
- Ensure all effects remain properly bounded
- Reduce likelihood of gradient evaluation issues
- Maintain mechanistic basis of temperature dependence
