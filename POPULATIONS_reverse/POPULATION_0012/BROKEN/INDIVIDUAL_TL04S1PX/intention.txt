This model incorporates density-dependent predation efficiency for crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). As COTS density increases, their per-capita predation rate decreases due to interference competition between individuals. This mechanism is supported by field observations where very high COTS densities don't necessarily result in proportionally higher coral mortality.

The addition of interference competition (beta_interference parameter) modifies the functional response equation to reduce predation efficiency at high COTS densities. This should help better capture the observed dynamics where coral cover sometimes persists even under high COTS abundance.
