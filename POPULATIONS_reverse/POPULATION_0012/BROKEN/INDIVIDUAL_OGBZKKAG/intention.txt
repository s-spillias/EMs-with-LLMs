Model Improvement: Type III Functional Response

The current model implementation uses a Type II functional response for COTS predation on corals. While this captures basic saturation effects, it doesn't reflect the observed pattern where COTS feeding efficiency often increases with coral density before saturating.

Looking at the model fits, there are notable discrepancies around 1990-1995 where observed COTS populations show sharp peaks that the model struggles to capture. This suggests the current Type II response may be oversimplifying the predator-prey dynamics.

The implemented Type III functional response:
1. Better represents how COTS feeding efficiency increases with coral density (due to easier prey location) before saturating
2. Includes a shape parameter that controls this density-dependent efficiency
3. Can produce more realistic population dynamics including potential for alternative stable states

This modification should improve the model's ability to capture:
- Sharp increases in COTS populations when coral density is high
- More realistic predation impacts on both fast and slow-growing corals
- Better representation of density-dependent predation efficiency

The pred_shape parameter value of 2.0 is based on literature values for similar marine predator-prey systems.
