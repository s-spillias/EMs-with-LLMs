Model Performance Analysis and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model underestimates sharp peaks in coral populations around 1990
- COTS outbreak dynamics are not well captured, particularly the rapid increases
- The model tends to smooth out population fluctuations

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature-dependent feeding efficiency for COTS to better represent:
1. The physiological impact of temperature on COTS feeding behavior
2. The potential for rapid increases in coral mortality during optimal conditions
3. The reduced predation pressure during suboptimal temperatures

This mechanism should improve the model's ability to capture:
- More dynamic COTS outbreak behavior
- Sharper changes in coral populations
- Better alignment of peak predation events with environmental conditions

The separate temperature optima for growth (28°C) and feeding (27°C) reflect that 
these processes may have different thermal sensitivities, allowing for more nuanced 
representation of COTS population impacts under varying conditions.
