Model Improvement: Asymmetric Coral Competition

The current model shows discrepancies between predicted and observed coral cover, particularly in capturing the oscillatory patterns seen in the slow-growing corals. The original model only considered total space limitation through K_coral, treating both coral types as equally competitive.

The improved model introduces asymmetric competition coefficients (beta_sf and beta_fs) to better represent the ecological reality that:

1. Fast-growing branching corals can overshadow and more strongly inhibit slow-growing corals (beta_sf > 1)
2. Slow-growing massive corals have a more moderate competitive effect on fast-growing corals (beta_fs < 1)

This modification should:
- Better capture the observed oscillations in coral populations
- Represent the different competitive strategies of coral growth forms
- Account for indirect effects where changes in one coral type more realistically affect the other

The competition coefficients are based on literature values from studies of coral reef community dynamics and competitive hierarchies.
