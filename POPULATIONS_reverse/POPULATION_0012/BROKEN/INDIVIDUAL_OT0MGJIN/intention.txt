Model Improvements:

1. Added temperature dependence for coral growth rates to better capture environmental stress effects
- Both fast and slow-growing corals are sensitive to temperature
- Uses Gaussian response curves with species-specific optimal temperatures and tolerances
- Fast-growing corals typically have narrower temperature tolerance than slow-growing corals
- This should help explain some of the observed variability in coral cover that the current model misses
