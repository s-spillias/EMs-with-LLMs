Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general declining trends in both coral populations
- However, it underestimates sharp peaks, especially around 1990
- COTS predictions show delayed response to coral abundance changes

Ecological Improvement:
Added size-dependent predation efficiency to better represent COTS feeding behavior:
- COTS feeding efficiency increases with total coral cover
- Predation rates increase additively with coral abundance relative to carrying capacity
- Creates moderate positive feedback: higher coral cover enables more efficient predation
- Should better capture increased predation during high coral cover while maintaining numerical stability

The size_effect parameter modulates this relationship:
- Values near 0 maintain basic Type II functional response
- Values > 0 increase predation efficiency with coral cover
- Literature suggests moderate values (~0.5) best match observed patterns
