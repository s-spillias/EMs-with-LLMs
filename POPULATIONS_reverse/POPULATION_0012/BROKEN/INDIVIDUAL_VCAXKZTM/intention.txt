Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general trends but struggles with high variability in coral cover
- Slow-growing coral predictions are particularly smoothed compared to observations
- Fast-growing coral dynamics show less temporal variation than the data

Ecological Improvement: Asymmetric Competition
Added asymmetric competition coefficients (beta_fast_slow, beta_slow_fast) to represent:
1. Strong competitive effect of fast-growing corals (beta_fast_slow > 1)
   - Branching corals can quickly overtop and shade massive corals
   - Creates more dynamic responses in slow-growing coral cover
2. Weaker competitive effect of slow-growing corals (beta_slow_fast < 1)
   - Massive corals compete mainly through space occupation
   - Allows fast-growing corals to maintain higher growth potential

Expected Improvements:
- More realistic coral cover variability through competitive interactions
- Better capture of differential recovery patterns between coral types
- Improved representation of space competition dynamics
