Model Improvements:

1. Added asymmetric competition between coral types:
- Fast-growing corals can overshadow slow-growing corals
- This better represents the vertical structure of reef communities
- Competition coefficient (comp_fast) captures shading effects

Expected improvements:
- More realistic coral cover dynamics through competitive interactions
- Better capture of slow coral suppression when fast corals dominate
- More dynamic responses in coral populations
