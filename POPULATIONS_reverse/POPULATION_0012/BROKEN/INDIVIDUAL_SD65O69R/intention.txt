Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Fit Analysis:
- The model tends to underestimate peaks in coral populations
- Dynamics are oversmoothed compared to historical data
- COTS predation impact may be oversimplified

Ecological Improvement:
Added density-dependent predation efficiency to better represent:
1. Reduced prey finding success when coral cover is low
2. Potential refuge effects where remaining coral is less accessible
3. More realistic predator-prey interactions at low coral densities

This modification should:
- Allow better preservation of coral at low densities
- Create more dynamic responses in the model
- Better match observed recovery patterns
- Improve ecological realism of predation processes

The pred_half parameter (15%) represents a reasonable threshold where COTS predation efficiency begins to decline significantly, based on literature values of coral cover where COTS impacts become evident.
