Model Improvement: Size-dependent Predation Efficiency

Current Model Performance:
- Underestimates sharp declines in coral cover around 1990
- Produces overly smooth predictions compared to observed fluctuations
- Misses some of the feedback dynamics between COTS and coral populations

Ecological Mechanism Added:
Incorporated coral size-dependent predation efficiency where COTS feeding becomes more efficient as coral colonies grow larger. This is based on:
1. Larger coral colonies are more visible/accessible to COTS
2. COTS can feed more efficiently on larger continuous patches of coral
3. Creates stronger feedback between coral abundance and predation pressure

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of rapid coral decline events
- More realistic predator-prey dynamics
- Improved representation of density-dependent processes
- More accurate prediction of population crashes

The pred_efficiency parameter scales how predation effectiveness increases with coral cover, while the adjusted handling_time better reflects observed feeding rates.
