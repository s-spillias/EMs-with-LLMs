Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Fit Analysis:
The model shows numerical instabilities and gradient evaluation issues while attempting to capture:
- Density-dependent predation effects
- Complex predator-prey interactions
- Coral cover dynamics

Ecological Improvement:
Simplified the predator-prey interaction while maintaining key ecological mechanisms:
1. Total coral cover affects predation efficiency
2. Basic Type II functional response structure
3. Reduced predation at low coral densities

Key changes:
- Removed separate handling time calculation
- Combined density effects into single scaling term
- Added numerical safeguard (eps) to prevent division by zero

The h_coral parameter now acts as a simple half-saturation constant that:
- Reduces predation when total coral cover is low
- Provides numerical stability
- Maintains basic density-dependent feeding behavior
