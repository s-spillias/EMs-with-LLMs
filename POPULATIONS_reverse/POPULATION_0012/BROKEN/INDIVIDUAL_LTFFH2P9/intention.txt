Model Improvement: Bounded Prey Switching Behavior

The model has been enhanced to include prey switching behavior with bounded attack rate adjustments. This modification addresses both the ecological dynamics and numerical stability requirements of the system.

Key improvements:
1. Relative abundance calculation now properly normalized between 0-1
2. Switching factor centered around neutral preference (0.5)
3. Attack rates bounded to prevent extreme values:
   - Minimum 10% of base rate to maintain basic feeding
   - Maximum 200% of base rate to limit predation intensity
4. Use of CppAD::CondExpGe/Le for smooth bounded transitions

Benefits of this approach:
- Prevents numerical instabilities from extreme attack rates
- Maintains ecological realism (predators always feed at some minimum rate)
- Provides smooth gradients for optimization
- Keeps predation pressure within biologically reasonable bounds
- Better reflects actual COTS feeding behavior where preference shifts are gradual

The bounded adjustment ensures both numerical stability and ecological realism while capturing the essential prey switching behavior observed in COTS populations.
