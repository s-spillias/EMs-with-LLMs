Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general trends but misses important dynamics
- Slow coral predictions underestimate peak values
- COTS predictions miss key population spikes
- Fast coral predictions are too smooth

Ecological Improvement:
Added asymmetric competition between coral types through shading effects:
- Fast-growing branching corals can overtop and shade slow-growing massive corals
- This is represented by a competition coefficient (beta_competition)
- The effect reduces slow coral growth rate using a saturating function
- Competition is asymmetric - fast corals are not affected by slow corals

Expected Benefits:
- More realistic representation of coral community dynamics
- Better capture of reduced slow coral growth when fast corals dominate
- Improved prediction of coral cover patterns during recovery phases
