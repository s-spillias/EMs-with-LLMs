Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows discrepancies between predicted and observed values, particularly in periods of low coral cover (1995-2000). The model tends to overestimate COTS predation impact during these periods.

Added density-dependent predation efficiency to better represent COTS feeding behavior:
- When coral cover is low, COTS must spend more energy searching for prey
- Predation efficiency scales with total coral cover relative to a threshold
- This creates a feedback where declining coral cover reduces COTS feeding success
- Should improve fit particularly during periods of coral recovery after major declines

The pred_threshold parameter (10%) represents the coral cover level below which COTS feeding becomes significantly less efficient. This value is based on literature showing reduced COTS activity and feeding rates in degraded reef areas.
