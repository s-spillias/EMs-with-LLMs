Model Performance Analysis and Improvements

Current Fit Assessment:
- The model overestimates COTS density during 1990-1995
- Fast coral predictions show excessive oscillations
- Slow coral predictions miss major fluctuations in 1985-1990

Ecological Improvement:
Added coral density-dependent predation efficiency to better represent COTS feeding behavior. When coral cover is low, COTS must expend more energy searching for prey, reducing their predation efficiency. This mechanism should:
1. Help prevent unrealistic COTS population growth when coral cover is low
2. Better capture the recovery phases of coral populations
3. Create more realistic feedback between coral abundance and COTS population dynamics

The new parameter h_coral represents the coral cover at which COTS achieve 50% of their maximum predation efficiency, based on studies of COTS foraging behavior and energetics.
