Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- Underestimates population peaks around 1990 for both COTS and corals
- Misses some of the rapid changes in population dynamics
- Generally captures long-term trends but smooths out extreme events

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature-dependent coral vulnerability to COTS predation because:
1. Thermal stress compromises coral immune responses and energy reserves
2. Stressed corals are more susceptible to predation
3. This mechanism can amplify COTS impacts during warm periods
4. Creates an indirect pathway where temperature affects predation efficiency
5. Helps explain observed correlation between thermal stress events and COTS outbreaks

Expected Impact:
- Better capture of population peaks during thermal stress periods
- More realistic representation of coral vulnerability
- Improved modeling of outbreak dynamics
- Better alignment with ecological understanding of coral-COTS interactions
