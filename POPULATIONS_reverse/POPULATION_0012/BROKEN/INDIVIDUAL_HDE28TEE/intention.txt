Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general trends but misses sharp population peaks
- COTS outbreaks around 1990 are underestimated
- Coral decline patterns are smoother than historical data

Ecological Improvement:
Added coral-dependent COTS growth modifier to represent:
1. Enhanced COTS reproduction when coral food is abundant
2. Reduced COTS population growth during low coral coverage
3. More realistic feedback between coral abundance and COTS dynamics

This modification should:
- Better capture COTS outbreak dynamics
- Improve representation of coral-COTS feedback loops
- Create more realistic population fluctuations
