Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows limitations in capturing the dynamics of coral cover, particularly for slow-growing corals. The historical data shows higher variability and more pronounced peaks and troughs than the model predictions.

Key improvements made:
1. Added asymmetric competition between coral types
2. Introduced separate competition coefficients (beta parameters) to represent:
   - Intraspecific competition among slow-growing corals
   - Stronger competitive effects of fast-growing corals on slow-growing ones

This better represents the ecological reality where:
- Fast-growing branching corals can overtop and shade slow-growing massive corals
- Competition for space and resources is not symmetric between coral types
- Available space for growth depends on both the total coral cover and the competitive effects

These changes should improve the model's ability to capture:
- More realistic variability in coral cover
- Asymmetric interactions between coral types
- Better representation of space competition dynamics
