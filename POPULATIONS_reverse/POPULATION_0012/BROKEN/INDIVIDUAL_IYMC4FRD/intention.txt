The model aims to capture coral-COTS dynamics with temperature-dependent predation vulnerability. When water temperatures deviate from coral optimal conditions, the coral becomes more susceptible to COTS predation. This represents how thermal stress can weaken coral defenses and make them more vulnerable to predation pressure.
