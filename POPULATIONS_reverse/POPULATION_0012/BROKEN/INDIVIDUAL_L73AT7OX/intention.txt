Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model overestimates COTS populations after peak events (1990-1995)
- Predicts more stable coral populations than observed
- Misses some of the rapid changes in population dynamics

Ecological Improvement:
Added coral cover-dependent feeding efficiency to better represent:
1. Reduced COTS feeding success at low coral cover
2. Energy costs of searching for food when coral is sparse
3. Natural feedback between resource availability and predation pressure

This modification should:
- Help prevent unrealistic sustained COTS outbreaks
- Better capture population crashes when resources become limited
- Improve the representation of recovery phases
