Model Performance Analysis and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- COTS predictions show overestimation after 1990
- Fast coral predictions miss high-frequency variability
- Slow coral predictions don't capture some key dynamics

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature stress effects on coral vulnerability to COTS predation. This represents:
1. Increased susceptibility of thermally stressed corals to predation
2. Synergistic effects between temperature stress and COTS outbreaks
3. More realistic predator-prey dynamics under varying environmental conditions

This mechanism is supported by research showing that thermal stress can:
- Weaken coral defenses
- Reduce coral energy reserves
- Make corals more susceptible to multiple stressors

The modification should improve model predictions by:
- Better capturing coral decline under combined thermal and COTS stress
- More realistic predation dynamics during warm periods
- Improved representation of coral resilience variation
