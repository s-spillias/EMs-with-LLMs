Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- Underpredicts peaks in slow coral cover
- Shows delayed COTS response to coral availability 
- Fast coral decline is too smooth compared to observations
- Does not capture competitive interactions between coral types

Ecological Improvement:
Added explicit competition effect from fast-growing to slow-growing corals through the beta_comp parameter. This represents:
1. Light competition - fast-growing branching corals can overshadow slow-growing massive corals
2. Space pre-emption - fast growers can quickly occupy newly available substrate
3. Flow modification - branching coral structures alter water flow patterns

Expected Benefits:
- More realistic suppression of slow coral growth when fast corals are abundant
- Better capture of coral community composition dynamics
- Improved representation of recovery patterns after disturbance

This addition maintains model parsimony while incorporating an important ecological mechanism supported by coral reef literature.
