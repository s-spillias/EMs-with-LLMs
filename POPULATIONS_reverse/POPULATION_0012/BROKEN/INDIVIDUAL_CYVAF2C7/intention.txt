Model Assessment and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model underpredicts peaks in slow coral cover, suggesting missing growth dynamics
- COTS predictions show delayed responses to coral availability
- Fast coral predictions are too smooth compared to observations
- Simple space limitation may not capture full complexity of coral interactions

Ecological Improvement:
Added asymmetric competition between coral types through shading effects. Fast-growing branching corals can overtop and shade slow-growing massive corals, reducing their growth rates. This is implemented through a competition coefficient (beta_competition) that reduces slow coral growth based on fast coral abundance.

This mechanism is ecologically justified because:
1. Branching corals typically grow vertically and can shade underlying massive corals
2. Light competition is a key factor in coral reef community structure
3. This asymmetric interaction helps explain the differential recovery patterns seen in the data

The competition term should improve model fit by:
- Allowing more dynamic responses in slow coral cover
- Creating more realistic feedbacks between coral types
- Better capturing the observed temporal patterns in coral community composition
