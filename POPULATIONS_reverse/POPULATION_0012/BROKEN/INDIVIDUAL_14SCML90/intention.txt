Model Improvements:

The current model underestimates COTS outbreak peaks and subsequent coral decline. A key missing mechanism is the temperature dependence of COTS feeding rates. Research shows that warmer temperatures increase COTS metabolism and feeding activity up to an optimal temperature.

Adding temperature-dependent predation rates should:
1. Better capture the magnitude of COTS impacts during warm periods
2. Improve prediction of coral decline during outbreaks
3. Create more realistic feedback between environmental conditions and predator-prey dynamics

This maintains model parsimony while incorporating an important ecological mechanism supported by empirical evidence.
