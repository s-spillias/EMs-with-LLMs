Model Performance Analysis and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model shows significant overestimation of COTS density during 1990-1995
- Fast coral predictions deviate substantially from observations during 1985-1990
- Slow coral dynamics show unrealistic rapid changes not matching historical patterns

Ecological Improvement:
Added coral cover-dependent feeding efficiency for COTS through a Holling Type II response modifier. This represents:
1. Reduced predation efficiency at low coral cover due to increased search time
2. More realistic predator-prey dynamics when resources are scarce
3. Better representation of energy expenditure in foraging

Expected Benefits:
- More accurate COTS population control at low coral cover
- Smoother transitions in coral cover predictions
- Better capture of system resilience
- More realistic predator-prey coupling

This modification is supported by field observations showing reduced COTS feeding rates in degraded reef systems and aligns with optimal foraging theory.
