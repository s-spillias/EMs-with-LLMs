Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows systematic deviations from historical data, particularly:
1. Over-prediction of COTS populations during outbreak periods
2. Under-prediction of coral cover variability
3. Missing important coral decline events

Added temperature effects on coral dynamics:
- Simple logistic temperature response function for coral growth
- Separate temperature tolerance parameter for corals
- Simplified coral growth and predation terms

Expected improvements:
1. Better numerical stability while maintaining temperature effects
2. More robust coral growth responses to temperature
3. Clearer relationship between temperature and coral dynamics

The logistic temperature response provides a smooth transition between optimal and stressed conditions while avoiding numerical instabilities. The simplified growth terms maintain the key ecological relationships while reducing computational complexity.
