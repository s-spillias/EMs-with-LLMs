Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- Underpredicts peaks in slow coral cover
- Shows delayed COTS response to coral availability 
- Fast coral predictions are too smooth
- Does not capture competitive interactions between coral types

Ecological Improvement:
Added asymmetric competition between coral types where fast-growing corals can suppress slow-growing corals through shading and space preemption. This is implemented through a competition coefficient (beta_comp) that reduces the effective growth rate of slow corals based on fast coral abundance.

Justification:
1. Fast-growing branching corals are known to overtop and shade massive slow-growing corals
2. This competitive effect helps explain why slow coral recovery may be limited even when space is available
3. The asymmetric nature (fast affects slow more than vice versa) reflects real reef dynamics
4. Literature supports strong competitive hierarchies in coral communities

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of slow coral suppression during fast coral dominance periods
- More realistic coral community dynamics
- Improved representation of recovery patterns after disturbance
