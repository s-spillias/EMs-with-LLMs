Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Predation Efficiency

Current Model Performance:
- The model underestimates peak COTS densities around 1990
- Subsequent coral decline is not captured well
- Temperature effects only influence COTS growth, not feeding behavior

Ecological Justification:
- COTS feeding rates are known to be temperature-dependent
- Higher temperatures increase metabolic rates and feeding activity
- This creates a stronger coupling between temperature and coral mortality
- Using same temperature response curve as growth maintains parsimony

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of COTS outbreak intensities
- More realistic coral mortality during warm periods
- Improved representation of temperature-driven ecosystem dynamics
- More mechanistic basis for predator-prey interactions
