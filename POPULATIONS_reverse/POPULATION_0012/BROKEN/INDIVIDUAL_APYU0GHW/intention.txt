Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows discrepancies between predicted and observed values, particularly during periods of rapid change in both COTS and coral populations (1990-1995). The model tends to overestimate COTS populations when coral cover is low and underestimate population crashes when food becomes scarce.

Added ecological mechanism:
- Resource-dependent COTS growth using a Holling Type II functional response (food_effect term)
- This creates a crucial feedback loop where COTS population growth depends on available coral cover
- The beta_food parameter controls how strongly COTS growth depends on coral availability
- When coral cover is very low, COTS growth is limited regardless of other conditions
- This should help capture population crashes when coral food becomes scarce

Expected improvements:
1. More realistic COTS population dynamics when coral cover is low
2. Better representation of feedback between coral depletion and COTS population growth
3. Improved prediction of COTS population crashes following coral depletion events
