Model Improvements:

Added temperature-dependent coral vulnerability to COTS predation. When sea temperatures exceed optimal levels, corals become more susceptible to predation due to reduced defense capabilities and increased physiological stress. This is implemented as a multiplier on attack rates that increases with temperature deviation from optimal conditions.

This modification should help capture:
1. The observed sharp declines in coral cover during high temperature periods
2. The corresponding COTS population spikes due to increased feeding efficiency
3. More realistic predator-prey dynamics under varying environmental conditions
