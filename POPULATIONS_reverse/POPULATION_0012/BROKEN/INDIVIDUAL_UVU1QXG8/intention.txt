Model Improvement: Temperature-Dependent Predation

The current model shows discrepancies between predicted and observed values, particularly around peak COTS outbreaks and coral decline events (circa 1990). While the model captures general trends, it underestimates the magnitude of these extreme events.

The improvement introduces temperature-dependent predation rates by modifying the attack rates with the same temperature effect function used for COTS growth. This is ecologically justified because:

1. COTS feeding behavior is known to be temperature-sensitive
2. Higher temperatures typically increase metabolic rates and feeding activity
3. The temperature effect creates more dynamic predation pressure that can better capture outbreak events

The temperature modification uses the existing temperature response curve (Gaussian function) that was already validated for COTS growth, maintaining parsimony while adding an important ecological mechanism.

Expected improvements:
- Better capture of peak predation events during warm periods
- More realistic coupling between environmental conditions and coral mortality
- Improved prediction of outbreak intensities
