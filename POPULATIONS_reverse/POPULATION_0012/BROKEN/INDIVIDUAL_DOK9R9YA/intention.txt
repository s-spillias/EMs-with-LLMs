Model Performance Analysis and Improvements

Current Model Performance:
- The model underpredicts sharp population peaks, especially around 1990
- Smoother predictions than actual data suggest missing feedback mechanisms
- Temperature effects alone don't capture full COTS population dynamics

Ecological Improvement:
Added food-dependent reproduction for COTS population growth through beta_food parameter. This creates a positive feedback loop where:
1. Higher coral abundance → increased COTS reproduction success
2. More COTS → increased coral predation
3. Reduced coral → reduced COTS reproduction

This mechanism is well-documented in COTS ecology where:
- Larvae success depends on available food resources
- Population outbreaks are more likely when coral is abundant
- Natural population control occurs through food limitation

Expected improvements:
- Better capture of sharp population peaks
- More realistic boom-bust cycles
- Improved representation of coral-COTS feedback dynamics
