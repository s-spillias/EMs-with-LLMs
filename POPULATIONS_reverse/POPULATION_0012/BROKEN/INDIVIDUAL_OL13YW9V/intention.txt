This model improvement incorporates temperature-dependent predation rates for crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). The original model only included temperature effects on COTS growth, but research shows that feeding rates are also strongly temperature-dependent in marine predators.

The modification adds thermal sensitivity to attack rates using a Gaussian response curve similar to growth, but with different optimal temperature and range parameters. This allows predation efficiency to vary with environmental conditions, which could better capture:

1. Increased feeding during warm periods leading to more severe coral damage during outbreaks
2. Reduced predation pressure during cooler periods allowing coral recovery
3. More realistic coupling between environmental conditions and ecosystem impacts

The separate thermal parameters for growth vs feeding reflect that these processes often have different thermal optima in marine organisms. This added mechanism should help explain the observed sharp peaks in COTS abundance and subsequent coral decline patterns seen in the historical data.
