Model Improvement: Asymmetric Coral Competition

The current model shows systematic underprediction of slow coral dynamics and misses some key temporal patterns. A key ecological process missing is the asymmetric competition between fast and slow growing corals.

Fast-growing branching corals can overtop and shade slow-growing massive corals, reducing their growth potential. This is implemented through a competition coefficient (beta_competition) that reduces slow coral growth based on fast coral abundance.

The competition effect uses a linear form with minimum threshold (max(0.1, 1 - Î²*fast/K)) because:
1. The competitive impact scales linearly with fast coral relative abundance
2. The minimum threshold ensures slow coral growth doesn't completely stop
3. When fast coral cover is low, the effect approaches 1 (no competition)

This mechanism should improve prediction of:
- Reduced slow coral recovery when fast corals are abundant
- More realistic coral community composition dynamics
- Better capture of observed temporal patterns
