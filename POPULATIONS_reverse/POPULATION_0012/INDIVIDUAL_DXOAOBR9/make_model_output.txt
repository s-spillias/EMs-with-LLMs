You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Predicting Crown of Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts through selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species).. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

Search results found for r_cots
**************************************************

Based on the search results provided, the crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) has a high intrinsic growth potential that can lead to population outbreaks and significant damage to coral reef ecosystems.

The first study, "Advancing projections of crown-of-thorns starfish to support management decisions" (Uthicke et al., 2023), compared CoTS density model predictions to observations and incorporated a new zone-specific mortality rate to account for differences in predation of CoTS. This suggests that CoTS populations can grow rapidly and outpace predation in certain areas, contributing to their high intrinsic growth potential.

The second study, "Preparing for and managing crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks on coral reefs" (Pratchett et al., 2023), notes that as CoTS is a primary predator of coral, a CoTS outbreak could cause a coral-algal phase shift induced by overfishing to happen earlier or with greater speed. This further highlights the significant impact that CoTS population growth can have on coral reef ecosystems.

The third study, "Validating effectiveness of crown-of-thorns starfish control programs on the Great Barrier Reef" (Babcock et al., 2023), found that growth reductions of 20%, 30%, and 40% had little impact on the equilibrium levels for slow-growing corals. This suggests that CoTS have a high intrinsic growth potential that can be difficult to control, even with targeted management efforts.

In summary, the search results indicate that the crown-of-thorns starfish has a high intrinsic growth potential that can lead to population outbreaks and significant damage to coral reef ecosystems. This is a significant challenge for coral reef management and conservation efforts.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, there does not appear to be a clear, definitive answer on the maximum sustainable population density for marine predatory starfish. However, the information provided offers some relevant insights:

1. The maximum population density found in the studies was not explicitly stated, but the results suggest that population density is a key factor in determining the "keystoneness" or ecological impact of starfish predators (ResearchGate article).

2. One study mentions a "sustainable density threshold of 3 ha−1" for crown-of-thorns starfish, a major predatory starfish species (NCBI article). This suggests that a density of 3 starfish per hectare may be a reasonable upper limit for sustainable populations.

3. The studies indicate that factors such as individual starfish traits, population variables, and environmental parameters can all influence the maximum sustainable population density (ResearchGate article).

4. Predation by starfish can have significant impacts on cultivated benthic organisms like mussels, so managing starfish populations is an important consideration for aquaculture and marine conservation (CDN Science Pub article).

In summary, while a precise maximum sustainable population density for marine predatory starfish is not provided, the available evidence suggests that a density around 3 starfish per hectare may be a reasonable upper limit, though this can vary based on the specific species, environment, and other ecological factors. Further research would be needed to establish more definitive guidelines. The key takeaway is that managing starfish populations is important for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems.

Based on the search results, the only numerical density value mentioned is 3 starfish per hectare (ha−1). To convert this to individuals/m2:

1 hectare = 10,000 m2
3 starfish/ha ÷ 10,000 m2/ha = 0.0003 individuals/m2

Therefore, the response would be:

{"min": 0.0003, "max": 0.0003, "value": 0.0003}

Note: This is a very low density and appears to be a conservative estimate of sustainable population. The value should be interpreted cautiously, as the search results explicitly state that population density can vary based on multiple ecological factors, and more research is needed to establish definitive guidelines.

Based on the search results provided, the ideal sea temperature range that supports the survival of crown-of-thorns starfish is around 28-32°C.

The first search result indicates that temperatures above 32°C are above the thermal optimum for crown-of-thorns starfish, suggesting that prolonged exposure to temperatures higher than this can negatively impact their performance and survival (Uthicke et al., 2022).

The second search result further supports this, stating that the survival chances of crown-of-thorns starfish increase by as much as 240% if sea-surface temperatures rise 2°C, which would put the ideal temperature range around 28-30°C (The Guardian, 2015).

The third search result provides additional context, noting that crown-of-thorns starfish typically spawn from December to April when the water temperature is around 28°C (Reef Resilience Network, 2003).

In summary, the ideal sea temperature range that supports the survival of crown-of-thorns starfish appears to be approximately 28-32°C, with 28°C being the optimal temperature for spawning and reproduction (Uthicke et al., 2022; The Guardian, 2015; Reef Resilience Network, 2003).

Search results found for temp_tol
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the thermal resilience range for crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) populations appears to be quite broad, with the ability to tolerate a wide range of temperatures.

According to the first study, crown-of-thorns starfish were able to develop and survive at temperatures ranging from 26°C (annual average) to 30°C (summer average) (Uthicke et al., 2022). This suggests that these starfish can thrive in tropical and subtropical marine environments with relatively high temperatures.

The second study further expands on the thermal tolerance of crown-of-thorns starfish, indicating that they can develop at temperatures between 19.4°C and 33.2°C, with the optimal range for development to the late-bipinnaria stage being 24.5-29.5°C (Fabricius et al., 2013).

The third study examined the metabolic responses of crown-of-thorns starfish to temperature, finding that their standard metabolic rate increased with temperature throughout the testing range of 24°C to 36°C (Gouraguine et al., 2021). This suggests that these starfish can maintain physiological function and activity even at relatively high temperatures.

In summary, the available research indicates that crown-of-thorns starfish have a broad thermal resilience range, with the ability to tolerate and thrive in temperatures ranging from approximately 19°C to 33°C, with an optimal range for development and growth between 24.5°C and 29.5°C (Fabricius et al., 2013; Uthicke et al., 2022; Gouraguine et al., 2021). This thermal tolerance likely contributes to the widespread distribution and invasive potential of these starfish in tropical and subtropical marine ecosystems.

Based on the search results, I'll extract the temperature tolerance range:

Minimum temperature: 19°C
Maximum temperature: 33°C
Average temperature: (19°C + 33°C) / 2 = 26°C

Therefore, the JSON response is:

{"min": 19, "max": 33, "value": 26}

The values are already in the expected units (°C), so no conversion is necessary. The range is derived from the studies by Fabricius et al. (2013), which noted the full developmental temperature range, and the optimal development range was specifically 24.5-29.5°C, which aligns well with the calculated average of 26°C.

**************************************************

Based on the search results provided, the regeneration potential for slow-growing massive coral communities appears to be promising, particularly through the use of microfragmenting techniques.

The first result from the study published in the journal Ecological Engineering suggests that if predation events are reduced, massive corals can be successfully grown and outplanted for restoration purposes (Shaver et al., 2018). This indicates that with proper management and protection, slow-growing massive coral species can be effectively propagated and transplanted to aid in reef restoration.

The second result from the journal Current Biology further supports the potential for coral restoration to drive rapid recovery of coral cover and carbonate production. The study found that net carbonate budgets at restoration sites can resemble healthy reefs within 4 years, highlighting the rapid regenerative capacity of coral communities when restoration efforts are implemented (Januchowski-Hartley et al., 2023).

The third result from the Sea Base website provides additional context on the use of microfragmentation techniques to expedite the growth of slower-growing bouldering and mounding coral species (Sea Base, n.d.). This suggests that advanced propagation methods can be leveraged to enhance the regeneration potential of slow-growing massive coral communities.

In summary, the search results indicate that with appropriate management strategies, such as reducing predation and utilizing microfragmentation techniques, the regeneration potential for slow-growing massive coral communities can be quite promising. These restoration efforts can lead to rapid recovery of coral cover and carbonate production, ultimately contributing to the overall resilience and recovery of coral reef ecosystems.

Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the growth rate of slow corals (year^-1). While the results discuss coral restoration, microfragmentation techniques, and regenerative potential, they do not provide a precise growth rate measurement.

Therefore, my response is:

Based on the search results, the regeneration potential for fast-growing branching coral species appears to be impaired compared to slower-growing coral species.

The research article "Fast Growth May Impair Regeneration Capacity in the Branching Coral Pocillopora damicornis" found a trade-off between growth rates and regeneration capacity in the branching coral Pocillopora damicornis (PMID: 23967057, PMCID: PMC3758286). The study showed that "high growth rates seem to impair regeneration capacity" in this fast-growing coral species.

Another study with the same title and similar findings was published in PLOS ONE (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0072618). This study also demonstrated that "a trade-off between growth and regeneration rates was evident" in Pocillopora damicornis, with high growth rates impairing the coral's regeneration capacity.

In contrast, the article "Restored coral reefs can grow as fast as healthy reefs, new research shows" indicates that planting new coral in degraded reefs can lead to rapid recovery, with restored reefs growing as fast as healthy reefs after just four years (Source: https://www.climateaction.org/news/restored-coral-reefs-can-grow-as-fast-as-healthy-reefs-new-research-shows). This suggests that the regeneration potential of some coral species may be higher than the studies on Pocillopora damicornis suggest.

In summary, the available research indicates that fast-growing branching coral species, such as Pocillopora damicornis, may have impaired regeneration capacity compared to their growth rates, likely due to a trade-off between these two processes (PMID: 23967057, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0072618). However, some coral species may be able to regenerate and grow rapidly when transplanted to degraded reefs (Source: https://www.climateaction.org/news/restored-coral-reefs-can-grow-as-fast-as-healthy-reefs-new-research-shows).
