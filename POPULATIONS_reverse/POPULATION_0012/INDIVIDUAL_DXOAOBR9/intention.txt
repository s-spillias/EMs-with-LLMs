This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral reef communities, specifically focusing on:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
- Temperature-dependent reproduction and survival
- Immigration-driven outbreak patterns
- Density-dependent mortality

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
- Two functional groups: slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals
- Different growth rates and susceptibility to COTS predation
- Temperature-dependent coral growth and mortality

3. Key Interactions:
- Selective predation by COTS on coral species
- Resource limitation through coral availability
- Environmental forcing through sea surface temperature
- Feedback between coral cover and COTS survival

The model uses annual time steps and incorporates both environmental drivers (temperature) and biological processes (predation, growth, mortality) to predict COTS abundance and coral cover dynamics.
