This model simulates Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impacts on coral communities of the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS population growth and mortality
2. Differential predation impacts on slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) vs fast-growing (Acropora) corals
3. Coral recovery dynamics with density dependence
4. External COTS immigration pressure during outbreak years
5. Resource limitation through coral availability
6. Environmental stress effects on coral growth

The model uses annual time steps and incorporates both direct and indirect ecological feedbacks between COTS abundance and coral cover. Predictions focus on COTS outbreak patterns and subsequent coral community responses.
