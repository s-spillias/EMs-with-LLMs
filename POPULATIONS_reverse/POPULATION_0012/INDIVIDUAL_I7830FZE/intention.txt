This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral reef communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS population growth and immigration
2. Density-dependent predation on two coral functional groups:
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.)
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites spp.)
3. Coral growth dynamics with competition between functional groups
4. Environmental forcing through sea surface temperature (SST)

Key ecological processes include:
- Temperature-modulated COTS reproduction and survival
- Selective feeding preferences between coral types
- Coral recovery rates based on functional group characteristics
- Density-dependent feedback between coral abundance and COTS survival
- Immigration pulses that can trigger outbreak cycles

The model uses Type II functional responses for predation and includes smooth transitions between ecological states to ensure numerical stability.
