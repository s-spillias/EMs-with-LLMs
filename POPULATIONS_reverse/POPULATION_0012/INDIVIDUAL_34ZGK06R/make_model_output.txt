You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Predicting Crown of Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts through selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species).. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) has an exceptionally high reproductive potential that can contribute to population outbreaks. 

The research indicates that individual female crown-of-thorns starfish can produce over 100 million oocytes (eggs) (Pratchett et al., 2014). This is considered the highest oocyte production ever recorded for a single starfish individual. Additionally, a review by Pratchett et al. (2017) states that crown-of-thorns starfish can release up to 100 million eggs per individual female, suggesting that outbreaks can occur even at low population densities.

The high fecundity of crown-of-thorns starfish is a key factor that contributes to their ability to undergo population explosions, which can lead to significant damage to coral reef ecosystems (Pratchett et al., 2017; Hoey et al., 2023). The exponential reproductive potential of this species allows for rapid population growth, which can quickly overwhelm coral reefs and lead to widespread coral mortality.

In summary, the crown-of-thorns starfish has an exceptionally high reproductive output, with individual females capable of producing over 100 million eggs. This exceptional fecundity is a primary driver of the species' ability to undergo population outbreaks that can devastate coral reef ecosystems (Pratchett et al., 2014, 2017; Hoey et al., 2023).

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the maximum sustainable population density of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) on coral reefs is not well-defined, but some key points can be made:

1. At low densities (less than 0.1 individuals per hectare), crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) have a minor impact on coral reefs and their health (Control efforts of crown‐of‐thorns starfish outbreaks to limit future coral loss, 2023).

2. Recorded densities of CoTS can range from 0 to 35.9 individuals per hectare, based on surveys (Increasing densities of Pacific crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster ..., 2023).

3. The highest observed density of CoTS was 35.9 individuals per hectare in a survey in the Pacific region (Increasing densities of Pacific crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster ..., 2023).

4. Another study reported the highest observed density of CoTS as 483 individuals per hectare in dive sites in Thailand (Population density of crown of thorns starfish in dive sites of ..., 2019).

In summary, while there is no definitive maximum sustainable population density for CoTS, the available evidence suggests that densities above 0.1 individuals per hectare can start to have significant negative impacts on coral reef ecosystems. Densities above 35.9 individuals per hectare have been observed, but these are considered outbreak levels that require active management intervention to control. The maximum sustainable density likely varies depending on local environmental conditions and other factors.

**************************************************
Asking claude
To convert the values from individuals per hectare to individuals per m^2, I'll divide the values by 10,000 (since 1 hectare = 10,000 m^2):

Minimum: 0 / 10,000 = 0 individuals/m^2
Maximum: 483 / 10,000 = 0.0483 individuals/m^2
Average: (0 + 35.9 + 483) / 3 / 10,000 = 0.0173 individuals/m^2

Therefore, the response is:

{"min": 0, "max": 0.0483, "value": 0.0173}

The calculation takes into account the different reported densities, converts them to the requested units (individuals/m^2), and provides a comprehensive representation of the population density range for crown-of-thorns starfish based on the given search results.

Based on the search results, the ideal sea temperature for Crown-of-thorns starfish proliferation appears to be around 26-28°C.

The first study found that the optimal breeding season for Crown-of-thorns starfish in New Caledonia is concentrated around the end of the calendar year, when water temperature reaches over 26°C (Pratchett et al., 2020).

The second study noted that sea surface temperatures at the collection locations for Crown-of-thorns starfish generally range from 24°C to 29°C annually (Pratchett et al., 2022).

The third source, a PDF from the Reef Resilience Network, states that Crown-of-thorns starfish spawn from December to April when the water temperature is about 28°C (Reef Resilience Network, 2003).

In summary, the ideal sea temperature range for Crown-of-thorns starfish proliferation appears to be between 26-28°C, based on the information provided in these search results. The starfish tend to spawn and reproduce most successfully in this temperature range.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, coral species can exhibit rapid recovery and regeneration potential under certain conditions:

1. Coral restoration efforts can drive rapid recovery of coral cover and substrate rugosity (structural complexity). A study published in the journal Current Biology found that within 4 years, fast coral growth supported a recovery of coral cover from 17% to 56% and an increase in substrate rugosity from 1.3 to 1.7 (Roff et al., 2022).

2. The recovery potential of coral and fish populations is influenced by the scale and intensity of disturbances. A study in Ecological Solutions and Evidence found that disturbances impacting smaller coral colonies resulted in coral and fish populations that recovered faster and more completely compared to larger-scale disturbances (Holbrook et al., 2022).

3. Coral restoration can take various forms, including growing, gardening, and outplanting corals, as well as harvesting naturally-produced coral eggs and larvae for restoration efforts. These techniques can help facilitate the recovery and regeneration of coral reef ecosystems (NOAA Fisheries, n.d.).

In summary, the search results indicate that coral species can exhibit rapid recovery and regeneration potential, particularly when restoration efforts are implemented, and the scale and intensity of disturbances are relatively small. Effective coral restoration techniques can drive the recovery of coral cover, substrate complexity, and associated fish populations.

Search results found for r_slow
**************************************************

Based on the search results, slow-growing coral species have a slower recovery and regeneration potential compared to faster-growing coral species. Some key points:

1. Recovery of coral and fish populations is fastest and most complete when the disturbance affects small coral colonies, rather than larger, slow-growing corals (Esch et al., 2023).

2. Slow-growing coral species, such as some Alaskan coral species, can take up to 60 years to reach full size, and their recovery may be even slower in a warming ocean (NOAA, 2023).

3. In contrast, coral restoration efforts that focus on fast-growing coral species can support a rapid recovery of coral cover (from 17% to 56%) and substrate rugosity (from 1.3 to 1.6) within 4 years (Roff et al., 2023).

These findings suggest that the recovery and regeneration potential of coral ecosystems is heavily dependent on the growth rates of the coral species present. Slow-growing coral species are more vulnerable to disturbances and may take decades to recover, while faster-growing species can facilitate a more rapid recovery of coral cover and habitat complexity.

Based on the search results provided, the maximum sustainable coral coverage across reef ecosystems is a complex and challenging issue. The key findings are:

1. Coral reef ecosystems are highly vulnerable to collapse due to a combination of local stressors and climate change. A study on the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region found that coral reefs in this region are "vulnerable to collapse at the regional level" (Obura et al., 2021).

2. The sustainable management of coral reefs requires a socio-ecological approach that considers the dynamics of socio-ecological resilience. A study on the Kotania Bay in Indonesia examined the "dynamics of socio-ecological resilience of coral reef" using a spatial-dynamic approach (Yulianto et al., 2023).

3. Globally, it is estimated that 70-90% of warm-water coral reefs could be lost by 2050 due to local stressors and climate change (IISD, n.d.).

In summary, the maximum sustainable coral coverage across reef ecosystems is difficult to determine due to the complex and dynamic nature of these ecosystems. However, the available evidence suggests that coral reefs are highly vulnerable to collapse, and sustainable management strategies that consider both ecological and social factors are crucial for their long-term survival.

Based on the search results, I found a relevant numerical range for coral coverage:

{"min": 10, "max": 30, "value": 20}

Reasoning:
- The search results indicate that 70-90% of warm-water coral reefs could be lost by 2050
- This implies the current/sustainable coral carrying capacity is between 10-30%
- The midpoint/average is 20%

The model expects percentage values, so the values are already in the correct units. The range reflects the significant potential decline in coral reef ecosystems due to climate change and local stressors.
