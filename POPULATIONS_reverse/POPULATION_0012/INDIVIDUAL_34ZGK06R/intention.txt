This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral reef communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model incorporates:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS population growth and mortality
2. Selective predation on two coral functional groups:
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.)
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites spp.)
3. Coral growth and recovery dynamics
4. External COTS immigration pressure
5. Environmental forcing through sea surface temperature

The model uses Type II functional responses for COTS predation on corals, temperature-modified vital rates, and density-dependent COTS population regulation. Coral recovery follows logistic growth with competition between functional groups.
