Model Summary:
1. Simulates the ecological dynamics of the Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Models COTS feeding on slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals.
3. Incorporates predator growth, coral loss due to predation, and external forcing (e.g., immigration, SST).
4. Uses smooth transitions and numerically stable likelihood calculations (lognormal error distributions) to capture the interactions.
