Ecological model for crown-of-thorns starfish predation on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef.
The model simulates how crown-of-thorns starfish feed on slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals.
Key ecological processes are captured:
1. Coral cover dynamics affected by predation rates.
2. Starfish abundance predicted through exponential functions of coral cover.
3. Use of smooth transitions and small constants (e.g., 1e-8) for numerical stability.
4. Lognormal likelihoods applied to log-transformed data to include all observations and ensure stable computations.
