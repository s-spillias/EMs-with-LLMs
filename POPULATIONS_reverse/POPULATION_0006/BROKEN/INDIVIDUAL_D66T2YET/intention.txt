This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates Crown-of-Thorns starfish predation on the Great Barrier Reef, where starfish feed on two coral groups:
1. Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites) that may have limited recovery rates.
2. Fast-growing corals (Acropora) that can potentially recover faster.
The model incorporates:
- A logistic recovery framework for corals modulated by predation pressure.
- Smooth transitions and small constants (e.g., 1e-8) to ensure numerical stability.
- Smooth penalties (via normal priors) to maintain biologically reasonable parameter bounds.
- Lognormal likelihoods to account for observed data spanning multiple orders of magnitude.
Overall, the model is built to robustly link the observed coral cover and starfish abundance with dynamic predictions under varying predation pressures.
