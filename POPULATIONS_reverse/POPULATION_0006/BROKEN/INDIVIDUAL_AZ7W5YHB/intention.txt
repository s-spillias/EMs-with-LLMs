Crown-of-Thorns (COTS) starfish feed on both slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals on the Great Barrier Reef. 
The model simulates coral growth and mortality affected by starfish abundance using smooth Michaelis–Menten transitions to represent feeding impacts.
Key processes include: 
1. Coral intrinsic growth reduced by feeding pressure.
2. Michaelis–Menten smoothing of feeding impacts.
3. Lognormal likelihood calculations for coral cover with fixed minimum error bounds.
