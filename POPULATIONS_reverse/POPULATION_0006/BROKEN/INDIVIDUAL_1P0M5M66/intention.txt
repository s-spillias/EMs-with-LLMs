The model simulates the ecological interactions of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef.
It focuses on the predation effects on both slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals.
Key components include:
1. COTS dynamics driven by an intrinsic growth rate and predation feedback.
2. Coral depletion due to COTS feeding, using smooth transitions and small constants for numerical stability.
3. A likelihood formulation that integrates observational data for coral cover and COTS abundance with lognormal and normal error models.
