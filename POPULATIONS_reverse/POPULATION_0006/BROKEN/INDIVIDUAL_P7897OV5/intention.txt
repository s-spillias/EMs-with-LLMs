This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates the dynamics of Crown-of-thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef while accounting for feeding on both slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing corals (Acropora). It integrates coral growth, predation impacts, and starfish population dynamics using smooth transitions, small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) for numerical stability, and biologically informed parameter penalties. Observations for both coral types and starfish abundance are included in the likelihood using lognormal error distributions.
