You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create the intention.txt and model.cpp files based on the user's request. The user wants a dynamic ecosystem model focusing on Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the    
Great Barrier Reef. They provided some detailed guidelines, so I need to make sure I address each point carefully.                                                                                                          

First, for the intention.txt file, it should be a concise summary of the model's ecological functioning. I'll start by outlining the main components: coral growth, COTS population dynamics, and their interaction. I      
remember from the user's data files that there are two types of corals—slow-growing (Faviidae) and fast-growing (Acropora). So, I'll include both in the model's description.                                               

Next, I need to explain how the model captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS. This involves mechanisms like resource limitation, predation, and environmental factors. I should mention that the model includes feedback     
loops and considers environmental conditions modifying the rates. Also, since the user emphasized numerical stability, I'll note the use of smooth functions and small constants to prevent issues like division by zero.   

Moving on to model.cpp, this is where the TMB model gets implemented. The user provided a detailed structure, so I'll follow that closely. Starting with including necessary headers, then defining parameters and data     
vectors. I need to ensure all variables are properly declared, especially distinguishing between data (ending with _dat) and predictions (_pred).                                                                           

The key ecological processes include coral growth, COTS feeding, mortality rates, and environmental influences. For coral growth, I'll use a logistic function because it naturally models resource limitation. Each coral  
type (slow and fast) will have its own growth rate and carrying capacity.                                                                                                                                                   

COTS feeding should be modeled with a functional response that accounts for prey density. Using something like a Michaelis-Menten approach makes sense here, where the feeding rate increases with prey density up to a     
point of diminishing returns. This helps prevent over-predation and keeps the model numerically stable.                                                                                                                     

Mortality rates are crucial for preventing unbounded growth in COTS populations. I'll include natural mortality and possibly density-dependent mortality. Adding an Allee effect could also be beneficial, where low        
densities reduce fitness, which might help in stabilizing the model.                                                                                                                                                        

Environmental conditions like sea surface temperature (SST) can influence both coral growth and COTS survival. Incorporating a smooth function that adjusts these rates based on SST will add another layer of realism to   
the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

For numerical stability, I'll use small constants (like 1e-8) where necessary to avoid division by zero. Smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs will help in preventing abrupt changes that could destabilize the model.

In terms of likelihood calculation, I need to ensure all observations are included. Using log-normal distributions for strictly positive data makes sense here, especially since COTS and coral cover data might vary widely
in magnitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                               

The model structure should be clear and well-commented. Each equation needs a comment explaining the parameters, their units, and how they're determined. I'll make sure to use the same variable names as provided in the  
data files for consistency.                                                                                                                                                                                                 

Finally, the parameters.json file should list all model parameters with their initial values, descriptions, sources, types, and optimization priorities. This helps in organizing the parameters and guiding the            
optimization process.                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Putting it all together, I'll structure the intention.txt to summarize the model's purpose and key features. For model.cpp, I'll define each component step-by-step, ensuring that ecological processes are robust and      
numerically stable. The parameters.json will be an array of objects, each detailing a parameter as per the user's specifications.                                                                                           

I need to make sure that all variables are correctly named and that there's no data leakage by using only previous time steps for predictions. Also, I'll include placeholders for environmental data like SST to show where
additional inputs can be integrated.                                                                                                                                                                                        

Overall, the goal is to create a comprehensive yet concise model that accurately reflects the ecological dynamics of COTS and corals on the Great Barrier Reef, adhering strictly to the user's guidelines.

Okay, I need to figure out the right commit message for these changes. The user added three files related to a specific population and individual. They all have .json, .cpp, and .txt extensions. Since they're adding new 
files, the type should be 'feat' because it's a feature addition or new functionality.

The description needs to mention what was added. Looking at the file paths, it's under POPULATION_0025 for an individual named XXNYE2HK. So I'll include that in the message. The files are parameters, model code, and 
intentions, so I can describe them as related files.

Putting it all together: "feat: add new population and individual files". That should be concise and within 72 characters.

Okay, I need to address the data leakage issue in the model. The user mentioned that the model is using current time step values of response variables (those ending with _dat) in its prediction calculations, which isn't 
allowed. This can lead to overfitting because the model would be using future or concurrent data points during the fitting process.                                                                                         

Looking at the model.cpp file, I see that within the loop, the code is directly accessing slow_dat[t], fast_dat[t], and cots_dat[t]. These are the observed data vectors, which shouldn't be used in the prediction         
calculations for the current time step. Instead, the model should only use lagged values (from previous time steps) to avoid data leakage.                                                                                  

So, I need to modify the model to store the predicted values from the previous time step and use those for the current calculations. This means introducing state variables that carry forward the previous predictions.    

I'll start by declaring new variables like prev_slow, prev_fast, and prev_cots. These will hold the values from the last time step. Then, within the loop, I'll update these variables after calculating the new growth or  
feeding rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                              

For coral growth (slow_growth and fast_growth), I should use the previous slow and fast values (prev_slow and prev_fast) instead of the current observed data. This ensures that the model only uses information from before
the current time step.                                                                                                                                                                                                      

Similarly, for COTS feeding, I'll switch from using cotsimm_dat[t] to the previous COTS prediction (prev_cots). This way, the model doesn't look ahead or use concurrent data points.                                       

I also need to handle the initial conditions properly. At the first time step, I'll set prev_slow, prev_fast, and prev_cots based on the initial observed values from the data files. This ensures that the model starts    
with accurate starting points.                                                                                                                                                                                              

Another consideration is numerical stability. By using lagged predictions, I might introduce some delay in the system, but this should be biologically plausible as there's naturally a time lag in population responses.   

I'll also make sure to update the REPORT statements to use the correct prediction vectors (slow_pred, fast_pred, cots_pred) so that the model outputs are aligned with the observed data correctly.                         

Finally, I'll test these changes by stepping through the loop manually for a few time points to ensure that the variables are being updated correctly and that there's no unintended data leakage anymore.                  


I understand there's an issue with data leakage in the model equations. The main problem is that we're using current-time-step values of response variables (those ending with _dat) in our prediction calculations, which  
violates the requirement to only use previous time step values.                                                                                                                                                             

Let me fix this by modifying the model.cpp file:

 6 Used appropriate units (converted coral cover from percentage to decimal for internal calculations)                                                                                                                      
 7 Implemented Allee effect on COTS populations                                                                                                                                                                             
 8 Added temperature sensitivity to both growth and predation processes                                                                                                                                                     

These changes ensure we're only using previous time step values for predictions, avoiding any data leakage issues while maintaining the model's biological realism.

Okay, I need to figure out the right Git commit message for the changes provided. The user added a specific file: POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0025/INDIVIDUAL_XXNYE2HK/model.cpp. 

First, I'll look at the type of change. Since it's adding a new file, the appropriate type is 'feat' because it likely introduces a new feature or functionality.

Next, the description should be concise and in the imperative mood. The key part here is that a model file was added for a specific population. So, I'll phrase it as "Add model file for population 0025."

Putting it together, the commit message becomes 'feat: Add model file for population 0025.' I should check the length—it's under 72 characters, so that's good.

I think this captures the change accurately and follows the guidelines provided.
