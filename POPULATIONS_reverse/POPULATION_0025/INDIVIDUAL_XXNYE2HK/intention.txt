COTS Outbreak Model Intention
This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on their population dynamics and interactions with coral communities. Key components:

1. Coral Population Dynamics:
- Separate modeling of slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals
- Growth limited by environmental conditions and competition

2. COTS Population Biology:
- Density-dependent reproduction and mortality rates
- Allee effect to capture low-density population weaknesses
- Temperature-dependent survival and recruitment

3. Predator-Prey Interactions:
- Functional response modeling feeding on coral communities
- Selective predation patterns reflecting observed dietary preferences

4. Environmental Influence:
- Incorporation of sea surface temperature (SST) effects
- Potential inclusion of other environmental forcings like nutrients

5. Feedback Mechanisms:
- Coral decline from COTS predation reduces future prey availability
- COTS mortality increases when food becomes scarce
- Temperature influences both coral growth and COTS survival rates
