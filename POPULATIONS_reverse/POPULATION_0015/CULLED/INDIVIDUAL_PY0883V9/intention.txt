The current model fit has shown systematic residuals in the slow coral dynamics, suggesting that the model underestimates the reduction in coral recovery in the presence of high COTS densities. To address this, an efficiency reduction parameter (e) has been introduced into the slow coral growth equation. Specifically, the intrinsic growth rate now incorporates an exponential decay factor, exp(-e * COTS_previous), which moderates growth under high starfish density conditions. This modification better captures the indirect stress and feedback mechanisms inherent in the system, leading to a more ecologically realistic model.
