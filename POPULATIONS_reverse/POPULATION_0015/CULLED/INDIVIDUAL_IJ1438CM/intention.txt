Current model evaluation indicates that the slow-growing coral predictions exhibit a systematic bias, suggesting that external environmental conditions and resource limitations are not fully captured.

This update introduces a new parameter, "env_s", which acts as an environmental efficiency modifier. It scales the intrinsic growth rate (g_s) of slow-growing corals, thereby accounting for resource limitations, temperature stress, nutrient availability, or other environmental factors affecting coral performance. This modification ensures that predictions for slow coral cover are driven solely by previous time step values and environmental conditions, thus avoiding data leakage and improving model performance as seen in the residuals.
