Below is a proposed ecological improvement. We introduce a new parameter epsilon (environmental efficiency scalar) into the model. This parameter modulates the efficiency term in the COTS reproduction equation, capturing environmental factors (for        
example, temperature or water quality) that affect reproduction success. The efficiency term now becomes scaled by (1 + epsilon), which allows the model to adjust COTS reproduction potential in response to environmental conditions. We add this new        
parameter to parameters.json with clear justification and modify the COTS dynamics in model.cpp to include the new term. Note that these changes use only previous time step predicted values, so no data leakage is introduced.

No additional files have been changed, and these simple enhancements should help capture environmental modifiers of the COTS reproduction efficiency, ultimately improving the fit as indicated by the residual analysis.

Below are the proposed changes. We add a new parameter epsilon to parameters.json (appended after the last parameter) with a clear ecological justification. In model.cpp we insert a new PARAMETER declaration for epsilon immediately after a1 and update the
efficiency calculation so that the efficiency term is now scaled by (1 + epsilon). Finally, we update intention.txt to include a brief description of these modifications and their expected impact based on the residual analysis.

 Added a new parameter, "epsilon", to scale the efficiency term in the Crown-of-Thorns reproduction equation by environmental conditions. This change captures the influence of resource limitations and environmental variability (e.g., temperature and wate 
 quality) on reproduction success, addressing observed biases in the residuals.
