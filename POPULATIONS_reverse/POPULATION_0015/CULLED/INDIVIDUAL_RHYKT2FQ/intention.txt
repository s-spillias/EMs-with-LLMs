Added a new parameter, "epsilon", to scale the efficiency term in the Crown-of-Thorns reproduction equation by environmental conditions. This change captures the influence of resource limitations and environmental variability (e.g., temperature and water quality) on reproduction success, addressing observed biases in the residuals.
