The residual analysis indicates systematic deviations, particularly in the predictions for slow coral cover. This suggests that environmental conditions may be influencing coral vulnerability to COTS predation in ways not fully captured by the current formulation.

To address this, an environmental modifier ("env") has been introduced into the slow coral dynamics equation. This parameter scales the damage inflicted by COTS on slow corals based on prevailing environmental conditions (e.g., water quality, temperature), thereby modeling resource limitations and a realistic efficiency of predation under varying conditions.

This ecological adjustment is expected to improve model fit by reducing bias in the residuals and better capturing the observed dynamics.
