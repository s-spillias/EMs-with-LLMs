The current model exhibits systematic overestimation of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) density at later time steps, as revealed by the residual patterns. This suggests that some indirect ecological feedbacks—particularly the role of fast-growing coral habitats in facilitating predators of COTS—are not fully accounted for. By introducing the new parameter "delta" into the COTS dynamics, we add an extra mortality term that captures this indirect mortality. This improvement increases the ecological realism of the model by incorporating a feedback mechanism linked to fast coral cover, thereby better aligning model predictions with the observed data.
