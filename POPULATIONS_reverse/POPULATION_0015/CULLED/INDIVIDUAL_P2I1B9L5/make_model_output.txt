 1 In model.cpp: We add a new mortality term to the COTS dynamics equation that subtracts an additional loss proportional to the previous fast coral cover. This accounts for indirect predation on COTS associated with fast coral habitat.                   
 2 In parameters.json: We add a new parameter delta with an ecological justification representing the indirect mortality on COTS from fast-coral‐associated predators.                                                                                         
 3 In intention.txt: We update the file to explain that the residuals showed a systematic overestimation of COTS density, and that the new delta parameter improves the ecological realism by incorporating a feedback mechanism.

 The current model exhibits systematic overestimation of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) density at later time steps, as revealed by the residual patterns. This suggests that indirect ecological feedbacks—specifically, the role of fast-growing coral      
 habitats in supporting COTS predators—are not being fully accounted for. By introducing the new parameter "delta" into the COTS dynamics, we incorporate an additional mortality term that represents this indirect predation. This enhancement improves the  
 ecological realism of the model by capturing resource limitations and feedback mechanisms, thereby potentially reducing the residual bias and better capturing system dynamics.

Below are the proposed SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. These edits update the COTS dynamics in model.cpp to incorporate a new indirect mortality term using the parameter "delta," add "delta" to parameters.json with clear ecological justification, and update       
intention.txt to explain the rationale.

 The current model exhibits systematic overestimation of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) density at later time steps, as revealed by the residual patterns. This suggests that some indirect ecological feedbacks—particularly the role of fast-growing coral  
 habitats in facilitating predators of COTS—are not fully accounted for. By introducing the new parameter "delta" into the COTS dynamics, we add an extra mortality term that captures this indirect mortality. This improvement increases the ecological      
 realism of the model by incorporating a feedback mechanism linked to fast coral cover, thereby better aligning model predictions with the observed data.
