This model improvement introduces a new parameter p_s in the slow-growing coral growth equation to capture non-linear resource limitation. Instead of assuming a linear reduction as coral cover approaches the carrying capacity, we now use a power function formulation (1 - ((slow_pred + alpha * fast_pred) / slow_K)^p_s). This adjustment is justified by residual patterns that show systematic deviations at high coral cover and reflects a more ecologically realistic representation of resource uptake limitation.
