We observed residual patterns suggesting that the current model does not adequately capture the influence of resource limitation on Crown-of-Thorns starfish dynamics. To address this, the COTS growth equation has been modified so that its intrinsic growth rate is now modulated by a saturating efficiency term based on total coral cover (slow_pred + fast_pred) from the previous time step. The new parameter "M" serves as a half‚Äêsaturation constant, representing the coral cover level at which COTS reproduction efficiency reaches half its maximum. This refinement, grounded in ecological theory linking food availability to predator growth, should better capture the observed dynamics and reduce systematic biases in the residuals.
