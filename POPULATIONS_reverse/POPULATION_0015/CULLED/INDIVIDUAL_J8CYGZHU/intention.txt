This revision addresses a systematic bias observed in the residuals where the model tended to overpredict COTS densities when fast-growing coral cover was high. The new parameter "f" scales the effect of fast-growing coral on the nutritional efficiency of COTS by modifying the efficiency calculation to use only slow-growing coral cover with a dampening effect from fast coral cover. This modification adds ecological realism by capturing competitive interference in resource uptake while ensuring that only previous time step values are used for predictions.
