Below are the proposed changes. I have chosen to add an environmental modifier parameter (env_eff) to modulate the efficiency term in the COTS reproduction equation. Our updated model multiplies the efficiency by this parameter so that, in periods of     
extreme coral cover (as revealed by the residual patterns), the effective reproduction of COTS can be scaled to match ecological conditions (e.g. temperature or nutrient availability). This modification should help capture feedback mechanisms and indirect
pathways, improving the fit.

 Improved ecological dynamics: The current model fit shows systematic residual patterns, particularly under extreme coral cover conditions. This suggests that environmental factors (e.g. temperature, nutrients) may modify the efficiency of Crown-of-Thorn 
 reproduction. We have introduced a new parameter "env_eff" that acts as an environmental modifier by scaling the reproduction efficiency in the logistic growth term for COTS. This adjustment enables the model to better capture feedback mechanisms and    
 indirect pathways mediated by environmental conditions, improving alignment with the observed data.

 Improved ecological dynamics: The current model residuals indicate systematic deviations under extreme coral cover conditions, suggesting that environmental factors (e.g. temperature, nutrients) may modulate the reproduction efficiency of Crown-of-Thorn 
 starfish. We have introduced a new parameter "env_eff" that multiplies the efficiency term in the COTS logistic growth equation. This environmental modifier allows the model to adjust reproduction rates based on underlying environmental conditions,      
 thereby capturing indirect feedbacks and improving overall model fit.
