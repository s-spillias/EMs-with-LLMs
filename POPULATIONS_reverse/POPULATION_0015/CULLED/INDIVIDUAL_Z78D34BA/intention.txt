The current model fitting indicates that residuals for slow-growing coral cover display systematic deviations from observations. This suggests the model is missing a key competitive interaction between the coral types. To address this, we have introduced a competition term ("comp") in the slow coral dynamics equation. This term represents the suppression of slow-growing corals by fast-growing corals through competitive exclusion and uses only previous time step predictions, thereby avoiding data leakage. This modification is expected to better capture indirect interactions and improve the fit of simulated versus observed coral cover.
