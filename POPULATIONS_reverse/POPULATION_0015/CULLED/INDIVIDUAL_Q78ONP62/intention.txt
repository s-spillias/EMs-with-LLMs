This TMB model simulates Crown-of-Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef. 
It incorporates outbreak patterns driven by intrinsic growth modulated by sea-surface temperature, 
immigration, and nonlinear resource limitation through saturating functions and smooth threshold effects. 
The model also captures selective predation on coral communities—specifically, slow-growing Faviidae/Porites 
and fast-growing Acropora—by linking coral recovery and loss to starfish abundance. Feedback loops and process‐specific 
efficiencies are embedded to reflect the ecological interactions, while small constants and smooth penalties ensure numerical stability.
