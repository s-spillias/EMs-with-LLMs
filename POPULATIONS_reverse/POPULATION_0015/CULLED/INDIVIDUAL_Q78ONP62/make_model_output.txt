You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Predicting Crown of Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts through selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species).. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }

 This TMB model simulates Crown-of-Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef.                                                                                                                                                              
 It incorporates outbreak patterns driven by intrinsic growth modulated by sea-surface temperature,

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) has the potential for exponential population growth under certain conditions. 

The first study from MDPI found that juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish exhibited exponential growth over their first year on the reef, reaching sizes up to 52.5 mm by mid-December (Pratchett et al., 2017). This rapid growth rate during the juvenile stage suggests the potential for exponential population increases.

The second study from Nature reported that based on the historical periodicity of 14-17 years between past population outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish, a new wave of population irruptions is expected to commence in the northern Great Barrier Reef in the near future (Hoey et al., 2023). This indicates the cyclical nature of crown-of-thorns starfish population dynamics, with the potential for exponential growth during outbreak periods.

The third study from Science Direct developed models to project future crown-of-thorns starfish population densities, incorporating new data on zone-specific mortality rates to better account for differences in predation (Morello et al., 2023). This suggests that understanding the factors influencing crown-of-thorns starfish mortality is important for accurately modeling their potential for exponential population growth.

In summary, the search results indicate that crown-of-thorns starfish have the potential for exponential population growth, particularly during outbreak periods when conditions are favorable for their rapid reproduction and survival. Continued research and monitoring of these population dynamics is crucial for understanding and managing the impacts of crown-of-thorns starfish on coral reef ecosystems.

Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the intrinsic growth rate (year^-1) for Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS).

While the search results discuss exponential growth potential and population dynamics, they do not provide a precise intrinsic growth rate value. The references mention:
- Juvenile growth to 52.5 mm in first year
- Population outbreak cycles of 14-17 years
- Potential for exponential population growth

However, these descriptions do not translate directly to an intrinsic growth rate numerical value.

Therefore, my response is:

No relevant values found

To obtain this specific parameter, I would recommend:
1. Consulting additional ecological population modeling literature
2. Conducting direct population growth rate measurements
3. Analyzing long-term population survey data for COTS

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the available evidence suggests that increasing sea surface temperatures have a significant negative impact on starfish (also known as sea stars) population dynamics:

1. Elevated temperatures can slow down the movement and metabolic rates of individual starfish. One study found that at 32°C, starfish exhibited a 14% slower movement rate and a 33% slower metabolic rate, as well as a fourfold lower probability of survival (Pincebourde et al., 2022).

2. Warming oceans are strongly linked to the dwindling populations of starfish. The previously common sea star is now considered an endangered species in many regions due to the impacts of ocean warming (World Economic Forum, 2019).

3. A meta-analysis of the impacts of ocean warming on echinoderms (the group that includes starfish) found that, on average, warming accelerates metabolic rate by 32% and reduces survival by 35% (Przeslawski et al., 2015).

In summary, the available research indicates that increasing sea surface temperatures have a detrimental effect on starfish population dynamics, leading to reduced movement, metabolism, and survival rates, as well as overall declines in starfish populations. These findings highlight the vulnerability of these marine invertebrates to the impacts of climate change and ocean warming.

**************************************************

Based on the search results provided, the coral cover destruction rate by starfish on massive corals can be summarized as follows:

Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) are a major threat to coral reefs, capable of decimating entire coral reef ecosystems. Studies have shown that COTS outbreaks can lead to significant declines in coral cover over time.

According to the first search result, a study observed a decline in coral cover from 47% to 21% at one station over a period of several years, which was attributed to the damage caused by COTS (ScienceDaily, 2013).

The second search result provides further evidence of the impact of COTS on coral cover. The study found that COTS predation accounted for 42% of the 27-year decline in coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef (Osborne et al., 2011).

The third search result suggests that control efforts to limit COTS outbreaks can yield a benefit of 5-7% of healthy coral area per decade on the Great Barrier Reef (Babcock et al., 2016).

In summary, the search results indicate that COTS can cause significant and rapid declines in coral cover, with studies reporting destruction rates of up to 50% or more over relatively short time periods. Effective control measures are necessary to limit the impact of COTS and protect the health of coral reef ecosystems.

Asking claude
To extract the predation rate on slow corals, I'll analyze the search results for numerical values related to coral cover loss.

The search results provide coral cover decline percentages, but not a direct predation rate per individual per square meter. The key values found are:

1. Coral cover decline from 47% to 21% (26% decline)
2. 42% of coral cover decline over 27 years
3. Potential 5-7% coral area recovery per decade with control efforts

However, these are aggregate percentages, not a specific predation rate per individual per square meter.

Without a direct measurement matching the requested units (% cover loss per ind./m2), I must respond:

No relevant values found

The search results provide overall coral cover decline statistics, but not the specific granular predation rate requested by the model. To obtain this precise measurement, additional targeted research or studies focusing on per-individual predation rates would be needed.

**************************************************

Based on the search results provided, the key points regarding coral cover consumption rate targeting branching coral species are:

1. Branching coral species, such as Acropora, tend to have the highest coral cover compared to other coral species like Porites and Merulina. Acropora had an average coral cover of 30.24 ± 16.17 cm2, which was more than twice the cover achieved by the other coral species (Evaluation of the performance and cost-effectiveness of coral, Acropora had the highest coral cover and mortality rates).

2. Herbivores play a critical role in maintaining algal consumption rates on coral reefs, especially as coral cover decreases. Whether herbivores can compensate for increased algal production as coral cover declines is an important factor in maintaining ecosystem function (Coral species composition drives key ecosystem function on coral).

3. Environmental factors, such as ocean warming, can negatively impact the growth rate and skeletal density of branching coral species like Isopora palifera and Porites spp., potentially affecting their overall cover and consumption rates (Growth responses of branching versus massive corals to ocean).

In summary, branching coral species like Acropora tend to have the highest coral cover, but their growth and cover can be impacted by environmental factors like ocean warming. Maintaining herbivore populations is crucial to compensate for decreased coral cover and sustain algal consumption rates on coral reefs.
