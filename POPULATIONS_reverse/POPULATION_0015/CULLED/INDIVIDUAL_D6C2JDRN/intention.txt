Current model residuals indicate a systematic bias in predicted COTS density, likely due to an oversimplified representation of resource uptake.
By introducing the environmental modifier parameter (phi) into the efficiency function (efficiency = phi * f(total_coral)),
the model now scales the effective coral resource uptake based on environmental conditions.
This provides a mechanistic link between environmental variability and COTS reproductive success,
improving the capture of indirect feedbacks from coral quality changes that were previously unaccounted for.
