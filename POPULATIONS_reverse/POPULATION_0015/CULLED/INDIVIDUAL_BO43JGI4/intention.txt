The model has been updated to incorporate an environmental efficiency modifier ("theta") in the COTS reproduction term. This parameter scales the resource-driven reproduction efficiency, allowing the model to capture the effects of environmental conditionsâ€”where values greater than 1 indicate favourable conditions boosting reproduction, and values less than 1 suggest stress. This enhancement improves the model's ability to simulate resource limitations and environmental modulation without introducing data leakage.
