Below are the changes that implement a new ecological mechanism: an environmental efficiency modifier parameter “theta” which scales the COTS reproduction efficiency term. In the model, the efficiency function now multiplies the original term by theta so 
that environmental conditions (favourable when theta > 1, or stressful when theta < 1) can modify the resource‐driven reproduction. This change improves model realism by linking environmental effects to resource uptake, without introducing data leakage   
because only previous time‐step predicted values are used in the calculation.

 The model has been updated to incorporate an environmental efficiency modifier in the COTS reproduction term. The new parameter "theta" scales the efficiency term such that environmental conditions can alter resource uptake for reproduction: conditions  
 that favor reproduction (theta > 1) or impose stress (theta < 1). This change is designed to better capture the ecological dynamics of resource limitation and environmental modulation.

 The model has been updated to incorporate an environmental efficiency modifier ("theta") in the COTS reproduction term. This parameter scales the resource-driven reproduction efficiency, allowing the model to capture the effects of environmental         
 conditions—where values greater than 1 indicate favourable conditions boosting reproduction, and values less than 1 suggest stress. This enhancement improves the model's ability to simulate resource limitations and environmental modulation without       
 introducing data leakage.
