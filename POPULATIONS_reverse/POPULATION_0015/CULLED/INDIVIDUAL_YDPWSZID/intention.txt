The current model fit indicates that fast-growing coral cover is consistently overestimated when slow-growing coral is abundant. To address this, a new competition term has been added in the fast coral dynamics equation. Specifically, the term 
    - comp2 * fast_pred(t-1) * slow_pred(t-1)
models the competitive suppression of fast-growing coral by slow-growing coral, thereby representing space and resource competition. This modification is ecologically justified and is expected to improve the model's accuracy by reducing bias in the residuals.
