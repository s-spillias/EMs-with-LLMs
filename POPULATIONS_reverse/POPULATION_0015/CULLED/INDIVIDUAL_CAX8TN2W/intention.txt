The current model exhibits residual patterns suggesting that slow-growing coral cover is influenced by additional ecological processes, particularly when fast-growing corals are abundant. The residuals indicate that the model may under-predict the decline of slow coral under competitive pressure.

To address this, we introduce the parameter "alpha" into the slow coral growth equation. This parameter represents the competitive inhibition of slow-growing corals by fast-growing corals. The updated functional form modifies the effective density in the logistic growth term of slow corals by including a contribution from fast corals weighted by "alpha". This adjustment helps capture resource limitation and interspecific competition without using current time step observed values, thereby avoiding data leakage.
