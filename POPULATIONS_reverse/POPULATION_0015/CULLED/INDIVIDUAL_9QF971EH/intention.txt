The current model underestimates COTS outbreaks when coral cover is low. To address this, we introduced a new resource limitation mechanism via the parameter "theta". Instead of using total coral cover directly to drive COTS reproduction, the model now subtracts the threshold "theta" so that only coral cover above this minimum contributes to reproduction efficiency. This modification improves the model fit by providing a more realistic representation of resource scarcity and its role in limiting COTS outbreaks, as supported by the residuals.
