Below are the proposed changes. We will (i) add a new parameter, eta, to capture a nonlinear (exponential) modification on how coral cover modulates COTS reproduction efficiency, (ii) update the efficiency calculation in the COTS dynamics to use this     
parameter, and (iii) update the intention file to document this improvement.

    This update introduces a new ecological mechanism into the model: a nonlinear modification of how coral availability influences the reproduction efficiency of Crown-of-Thorns starfish.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
    Previously, the efficiency term was computed as a linear fraction of total coral cover over a half-saturation constant. Now, by raising this fraction to the power of a new parameter `eta`, the model can flexibly capture threshold effects and nonlinea 
    responses—such as an enhanced sensitivity when total coral cover is very low. This adjustment is expected to improve model fit by better aligning with residual patterns that suggested the linear assumption was underestimating resource limitations und 
    certain conditions.

 This update introduces a new ecological mechanism into the model: a nonlinear modification of how coral availability influences the reproduction efficiency of Crown-of-Thorns starfish.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 Previously, the efficiency term was computed as a linear fraction of total coral cover over a half-saturation constant. Now, by raising this fraction to the power of a new parameter `eta`, the model can flexibly capture threshold effects and nonlinear   
 responses—especially when total coral cover is very low. This adjustment is expected to improve model fit by reducing biases observed in the residuals that indicated an underestimation of resource limitation effects.
