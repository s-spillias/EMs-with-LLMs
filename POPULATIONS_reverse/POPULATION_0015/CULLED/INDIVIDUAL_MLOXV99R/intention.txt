This model predicts Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef by linking
their logistic growth and outbreak tendencies to feedbacks from coral communities. It incorporates
multiple forms of resource limitation with saturating functions, process efficiencies, and environmental
modifiers. The model simulates how COTS predation selectively reduces slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites)
coral cover compared to fast-growing (Acropora) species, thereby capturing indirect effects and ecological 
feedback loops. Initial conditions are taken from observed data, and predictions are generated using only 
previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
