Current model fit indicates limitations in capturing variations in coral recovery dynamics under different environmental conditions. Residual analysis reveals that the intrinsic coral growth rates may not adequately adapt to shifts in resource availability, leading to systematic misfits in years with atypical conditions. 

By incorporating a new environmental productivity multiplier (E) into both slow and fast coral growth equations, the model now more explicitly scales the growth rates (g_s and g_f) based on resource availability. This adjustment improves the representation of feedbacks between coral cover and COTS reproduction efficiency (via resource saturation) while ensuring predictions only rely on previous time-step values. These improvements are expected to yield a better fit to observed dynamics.
