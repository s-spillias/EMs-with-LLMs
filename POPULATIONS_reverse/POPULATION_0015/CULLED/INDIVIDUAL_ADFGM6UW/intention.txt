This model predicts Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef by simulating interactions with coral communities. It incorporates ecological processes such as logistic growth with resource limitation, environmental forcing via sea surface temperature, immigration, and selective predation on two coral groups (slow-growing Faviidae/Porites and fast-growing Acropora). Model equations use lagged state values to prevent data leakage and employ smooth transitions with small constants for numerical stability. Likelihood is computed using lognormal error distributions.
