Added a new parameter "E" to modulate COTS reproduction efficiency based on environmental quality. 
This ecological improvement allows the efficiency of resource utilization by Crown-of-Thorns starfish 
to vary with the environmental conditions, capturing nonlinear aspects of resource limitations in coral recovery. 
This change is expected to address residual patterns by allowing a more flexible and realistic representation 
of resource uptake under varying environmental conditions.
