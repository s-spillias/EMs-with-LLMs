The current model residuals indicate that the slow coral predictions could be improved by better representing the predatorâ€“prey dynamics. In this update, the reduction in slow coral cover due to COTS predation now employs a type III (sigmoidal) functional response. This change introduces a refuge effect at low slow coral densities, meaning that when coral cover is low, predation is less efficient, which is ecologically plausible. This modification is expected to improve the model's fit by more accurately capturing nonlinear interactions between COTS and slow-growing corals.
