Below are the planned changes in order to introduce an environmental modifier to the COTS reproduction efficiency. This new mechanism multiplies the current efficiency term (expressed as total coral/(M + total coral)) by a new parameter, env. This        
captures, for example, how environmental conditions such as temperature, currents, or nutrient availability might enhance or inhibit COTS reproduction. In our mathematical model the efficiency term now becomes:                                             

efficiency = env × (total_coral / (M + total_coral))                                                                                                                                                                                                           

This change should allow the model to better capture errors seen in the residuals, by scaling the effective resource uptake based on fluctuating environmental drivers, while the simulations remain free from data leakage (only previous time step values are
used).

These changes should help the model better adjust the COTS growth predictions in response to ecological conditions, thereby reducing the discrepancies shown by the residuals.

Below are the proposed changes for the new environmental modifier mechanism. In summary, we will:                                                                                                                                                              

 1 In model.cpp, add a new parameter env right after the PARAMETER(M); line.                                                                                                                                                                                   
 2 Update the efficiency calculation to multiply by env.                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 3 In parameters.json, add a new parameter entry for env.                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 4 In intention.txt, update the description to reflect the environmental modifier instead of the previous “eta” exponent mechanism.

 This update introduces a new ecological mechanism into the model: a nonlinear modification of how coral availability influences the reproduction efficiency of Crown-of-Thorns starfish.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 Previously, the efficiency term was computed as a linear fraction of total coral cover over a half-saturation constant. Now, by raising this fraction to the power of a new parameter `eta`, the model can flexibly capture threshold effects and nonlinear   
 responses—especially when total coral cover is very low. This adjustment is expected to improve model fit by reducing biases observed in the residuals that indicated an underestimation of resource limitation effects.

 This update introduces a new ecological mechanism into the model: an environmental modifier that scales COTS reproduction efficiency according to external conditions.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 Previously, the efficiency term was computed as a linear fraction of total coral cover over a half-saturation constant. Now, this fraction is multiplied by a new parameter `env`, representing environmental influences such as temperature, currents, and   
 nutrient availability. This modification allows the model to capture threshold effects and improves fit by accounting for environmental stressors that modulate resource uptake efficiency.
