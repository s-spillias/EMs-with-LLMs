Model Improvement Explanation:
The current residual diagnostics indicate that the model overestimates COTS reproduction when coral cover is very low. This is likely due to the linear assumption in the original Michaelisâ€“Menten formulation of the reproduction efficiency.
  
To address this, we introduced a nonlinearity parameter, gamma, into the efficiency term, updating it to:
  
  efficiency = (total_coral^gamma) / (M + total_coral^gamma)
  
This modification allows for a much steeper decline in reproduction efficiency under low coral conditions, thereby capturing threshold effects of resource limitation. This adjustment is expected to reduce the bias observed in the residuals and improve the overall model fit by better representing the ecological feedback between coral cover and COTS dynamics.
