The current model tends to underestimate slow coral cover under favorable conditions, suggesting that resource limitations and environmental stressors are not fully captured by the existing logistic growth formulation. By introducing the env_s parameter as an efficiency modifier for slow coral intrinsic growth, the model now allows for variation in coral growth based on environmental conditions. This change reflects the ecological reality that resource uptake and growth efficiency can be limited by environmental factors, and it should improve the alignment between predicted and observed coral cover.
