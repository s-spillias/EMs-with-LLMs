Current model residuals suggest that the fixed intrinsic growth rate may be too inflexible to capture variations in starfish reproduction under differing environmental conditions. This update introduces an environmental forcing parameter (`env_mod`) that scales the reproduction efficiency of Crown-of-Thorns starfish. Ecologically, this multiplier represents external influences such as temperature, currents, and nutrient availability which are known to affect outbreak dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef. Incorporating this additional mechanism is expected to improve the modelâ€™s fit by accurately capturing feedbacks between the environment and population dynamics.
