Current model fit:
The residuals indicate that the model systematically misestimates COTS abundance, suggesting that the intrinsic growth rate may not be adequately moderated by resource (coral) availability.

Improvement description:
We have introduced a new parameter, "theta", that modulates the COTS intrinsic growth rate based on the available coral cover. The effective growth rate is computed as:
    r_eff = r * (1 + theta * (coral_norm - 0.5)),
where coral_norm is the average of slow and fast coral cover, normalized by their respective carrying capacities (slow_K and fast_K). This modification ensures that predictions at time step t use only the lagged coral values from t-1, avoiding data leakage while capturing feedback whereby abundant coral enhances COTS growth and scarce coral limits it.
