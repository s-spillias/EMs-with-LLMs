Improvement: Incorporated a positive feedback mechanism where slow coral cover increases the effective carrying capacity for COTS via a new parameter, beta. This change modifies the logistic growth term so that the available resources (reflected by K + beta * slow_pred from the previous time step) more realistically support COTS density. This adjustment is expected to reduce systematic residual patterns, ensuring that the model more accurately captures the ecological dynamics without data leakage.
