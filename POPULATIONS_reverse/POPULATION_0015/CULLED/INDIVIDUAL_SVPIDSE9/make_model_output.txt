Below is one proposal to improve the model. In the current fit (see residuals in intention.txt) the model tends to over‐predict COTS density when coral cover is low, suggesting that an additional mortality mechanism may be operating (e.g. via starvation).
We can represent this mechanism by adding an extra mortality term to Equation 1 in the model. This term reduces COTS density when total coral cover is low by applying an exponential decay function. We add a new parameter a_starv to capture this effect in 
ecological terms. The updated equation uses only previous time step predicted values, avoiding any data leakage.

 The residual analysis indicates that the current model tends to overestimate Crown‐of‐Thorns starfish (COTS) density when coral cover is low, suggesting that starvation (resource limitation) effects on COTS mortality may not be fully captured.           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 To address this, we have added an additional mortality term based on low coral cover. The term, parameterized by "a_starv", causes an increased mortality rate when the total predicted coral cover is low. This change better reflects the ecological realit 
 that sparse coral environments can enhance starvation effects on COTS, thereby improving the fit of the model.

Once you have applied these changes, the model will include an additional ecological mechanism—starvation-induced mortality—that should help better capture the observed dynamics under low coral cover conditions.

 The residual analysis indicates that the current model tends to overestimate Crown‐of‐Thorns starfish (COTS) density when coral cover is low, suggesting that starvation (resource limitation) effects on COTS mortality may not be fully captured.           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 To address this, we have added an additional mortality term based on low coral cover. The term, parameterized by "a_starv", causes an increased mortality rate when the total predicted coral cover is low. This change better reflects the ecological realit 
 that sparse coral environments can enhance starvation effects on COTS, thereby improving the fit of the model.
