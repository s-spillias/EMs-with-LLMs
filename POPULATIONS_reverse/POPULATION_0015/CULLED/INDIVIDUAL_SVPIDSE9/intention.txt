The residual analysis indicates that the current model tends to overestimate Crown‐of‐Thorns starfish (COTS) density when coral cover is low, suggesting that starvation (resource limitation) effects on COTS mortality may not be fully captured.

To address this, we have added an additional mortality term based on low coral cover. The term, parameterized by "a_starv", causes an increased mortality rate when the total predicted coral cover is low. This change better reflects the ecological reality that sparse coral environments can enhance starvation effects on COTS, thereby improving the fit of the model.
