You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Predicting Crown of Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts through selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species).. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

Below is the SEARCH/REPLACE block for POPULATIONS\POPULATION_0015\INDIVIDUAL_3UZLE799\model.cpp. This change enforces a strict lower bound (min_sd) on the predictions to avoid negative values (and subsequent log domain errors) that are causing NA/NaN     
gradients.

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) has an extremely high reproductive potential that can contribute to its ability to undergo population outbreaks.

The key findings from the search results are:

1. The highest oocyte (egg) production recorded for an individual female COTS is over 100 million oocytes (Relationships between size and reproductive output in the crown-of-thorns starfish).

2. COTS are highly fecund, with individual females capable of releasing up to 100 million eggs (Crown of thorns starfish life-history traits contribute to outbreaks, a review of research progress).

3. The high reproductive output of COTS, even at low population densities, can seed population outbreaks (Crown of thorns starfish life-history traits contribute to outbreaks, a review of research progress).

4. COTS population dynamics are driven by demographic processes, including reproduction, which can contribute to outbreaks (Advancing projections of crown-of-thorns starfish to support management).

In summary, the crown-of-thorns starfish has an exceptionally high reproductive potential, with individual females capable of producing over 100 million eggs. This high fecundity, even at low population densities, can contribute to the ability of COTS to undergo population outbreaks that can have significant impacts on coral reef ecosystems. The reproductive capacity of COTS is a key factor in understanding and managing their population dynamics.

Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the log intrinsic growth rate of COTS (year^-1). 

While the results discuss the high reproductive potential of COTS (with up to 100 million eggs per female) and mention population dynamics, they do not provide a direct numerical value for the intrinsic growth rate.

Therefore, my response is:

Based on the search results provided, predation can have a significant impact on the community structure of slow-growing coral reef ecosystems.

The first study found that predators can exert top-down control on coral reef fish assemblages, interacting with species at lower trophic levels primarily through predation (Hixon, 1991). This suggests that predators play a key role in shaping the overall community structure of coral reef ecosystems.

The second study examined the effects of site selection, coral species, and fisheries management on predation rates in coral reefs. The researchers used remote underwater video to identify potential predators and found that predation can vary significantly based on these factors (Benkwitt et al., 2023).

The third study, a book chapter, provides a more in-depth analysis of predation as a process structuring coral reef fish communities. It outlines two key predictions: 1) a negative relationship between the abundance of predators and prey, and 2) a negative relationship between predator abundance and local prey diversity (Hixon, 1991).

Taken together, these studies suggest that predation can have a significant impact on the community structure of slow-growing coral reef ecosystems. Predators can exert top-down control, shaping the abundance and diversity of prey species. This is particularly important in slow-growing coral reef communities, where the recovery from disturbances can be slow, and predation may play a crucial role in maintaining the overall ecosystem structure.

The search results discuss predation rates and impacts on coral reef ecosystems qualitatively, but do not provide any specific numerical values for log predation rate on slow-growing coral in year^-1 units. While the sources discuss predation as an important ecological process, they do not quantify the predation rate with a numerical value that could be extracted for the requested parameter.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the degradation rate of coral reefs due to selective predation by crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) can be summarized as follows:

Crown-of-thorns starfish are a major contributor to widespread coral reef degradation worldwide. Outbreaks of COTS can decimate coral populations, leading to significant and ongoing coral reef degradation (Phys.org, 2024; NCBI, 2022).

The feeding biology and life-history traits of COTS contribute to their ability to cause rapid and severe coral mortality during outbreaks. COTS are voracious predators of coral polyps, and their population dynamics and feeding behaviors are closely linked to the degradation of coral habitats (Science Direct, 2024; NCBI, 2022).

Factors such as reef degradation from anthropogenic sources (e.g., pollution, climate change) can exacerbate COTS outbreaks and lead to further coral loss (NCBI, 2022). Stronger evidence is emerging on the importance of COTS predators in reducing the frequency and severity of these outbreaks, which is crucial for coral reef conservation and restoration efforts.

In summary, the degradation rate of coral reefs due to selective predation by crown-of-thorns starfish can be rapid and severe, with COTS outbreaks contributing significantly to the ongoing global decline of coral ecosystems. Addressing the complex factors that contribute to COTS outbreaks is a critical challenge for coral reef management and conservation.

The search results provide a qualitative description of crown-of-thorns starfish predation on coral reefs, but do not include specific numerical values for the log predation rate on fast-growing coral (year^-1). While the text discusses coral degradation and predation, it does not provide quantitative data that can be directly translated into the requested parameter.

To obtain this specific numerical value, additional research or more detailed scientific sources would be needed that explicitly measure the predation rate in the required units.
