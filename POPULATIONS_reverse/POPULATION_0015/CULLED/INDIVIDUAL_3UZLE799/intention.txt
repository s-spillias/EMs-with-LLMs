Ecological Model for Predicting Crown-of-Thorns Starfish Dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef

This model simulates the population dynamics of COTS starfish and their selective predation on two coral communities:
1. Slow-growing coral (Faviidae and Porites spp.)
2. Fast-growing coral (Acropora spp.)

Key ecological processes include:
- Logistic population growth of COTS modulated by resource limitation through saturating functional responses.
- Coral loss due to predation using a non-linear, saturating approach that avoids abrupt transitions.
- Effects of environmental conditions implemented as modifiers on growth and predation rates.
- Feedback loops between coral availability and predation pressure, with smooth transitions to ensure numerical stability.

Model predictions (_pred) are generated using previous time step values only to avoid data leakage.
