Updated Model Intentions:
Added a new environmental quality parameter "E" that multiplies the intrinsic growth rates of both slow-growing and fast-growing corals. This modification captures the influence of environmental conditions (e.g., water quality, temperature) on coral recovery and growth. Incorporating this factor is expected to improve the model fit (as indicated by residuals) by accounting for environmental variability that can limit or enhance coral dynamics while ensuring predictions rely solely on previous time step values.
