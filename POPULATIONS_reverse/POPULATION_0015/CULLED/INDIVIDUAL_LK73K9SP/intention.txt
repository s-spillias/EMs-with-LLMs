The current model residuals indicate that while the logistic framework captures the broad trends of Crown-of-Thorns starfish dynamics, there is systematic underestimation of reproduction during environmentally favourable periods. By incorporating an environmental modifier (env) into the COTS reproduction term—changing it from "r * efficiency" to "r * env * efficiency"—the model now accounts for additional reproductive boosts under favorable conditions (e.g., higher nutrient availability or optimal temperatures). This refinement, supported by ecological theory and ensuring no data leakage by relying only on previous time step values, is expected to reduce bias in the residuals and improve overall fit.
