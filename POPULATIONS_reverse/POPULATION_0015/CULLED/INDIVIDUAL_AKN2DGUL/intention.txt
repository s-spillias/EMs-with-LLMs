Added new parameter "env" to modulate the intrinsic growth term of COTS in the model. This parameter represents environmental favorability (e.g., temperature, nutrient availability) and accounts for indirect feedback mechanisms on reproduction efficiency. Incorporating "env" is expected to improve model fit by reflecting additional ecological realism in outbreak dynamics.
