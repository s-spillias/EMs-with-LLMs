This model improvement incorporates an Allee effect in COTS reproduction by adding parameters A (the threshold density) and gamma (the transition steepness). At low COTS densities, the reproductive output is diminished, capturing density‐dependent limitations. This change aims to improve the model’s ability to capture outbreak onset and better reflect the observed residual patterns.
