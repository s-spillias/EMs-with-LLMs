The revised model now implements a non-linear, Hill function form in the efficiency term for COTS reproduction. In particular, the new parameter n_eff (Hill exponent) allows for a threshold-like response in reproduction as coral availability increases. This modification is expected to better capture the observed residual patterns and ecological feedbacks—especially under resource limitation—thereby improving model fit.
