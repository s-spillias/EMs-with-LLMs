Below is one ecologically meaningful change: we now introduce a conversion efficiency parameter eta in the COTS reproduction term. Ecologically, even if coral is available, only a fraction of it is effectively used (e.g., because of variability in        
resource quality or behavioral inefficiencies). This change multiplies the efficiency term by eta, making the model better able to capture resource-use inefficiencies. In addition, we add eta to the parameters file (with an initial value of 0.8) along    
with an ecological justification.

The current model sometimes overpredicts or underpredicts the starfish population because it assumes all available coral contributes equally to reproduction. By introducing the eta parameter, only a fraction of the available coral cover is converted into 
reproductive output, thus adding realism—especially under high coral cover conditions where not all resources are used efficiently. This change should help reduce residuals and better capture the eco-dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish outbreaks on the  
GBR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

To test the changes, compile your project as usual and compare residuals with your previous runs.

Below are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the two files you added to the chat. These changes introduce a new conversion efficiency parameter, eta, in the COTS reproduction term of the model, which scales the available coral resources. This addition is      
ecologically justified since not all coral cover is equally effective in contributing to reproduction, thereby addressing observed biases in residuals.                                                                                                        

If you would like to further update the explanation in the model goals or intention file (e.g., intention.txt), please add that file to the chat.
