Updated the model to include a new efficiency parameter (e2) in the slow coral dynamics equation.
This parameter captures variation in Crown-of-Thorns starfish predation efficiency on slow corals due to environmental or physiological conditions.
Analysis of model residuals indicated a systematic bias in slow coral predictions. Incorporating e2 allows the model to adjust the effective damage inflicted by COTS,
thereby improving the representation of resource limitations and indirect pathways within the system.
All predictions continue to use only previous time step values, ensuring no data leakage.
