Added a new environmental favorability factor ("env") that scales the efficiency term in the COTS reproduction equation.
This parameter captures unobserved environmental influences—such as water temperature, nutrient availability, and other stressors—
on the efficiency of resource uptake for reproduction. Incorporating "env" helps to better simulate the system’s response to resource limitations,
improve outbreak pattern predictions, and reduce residual bias by ensuring that only previous time step values are used in the computations.
