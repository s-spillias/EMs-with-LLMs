This model simulates the dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef,
with a focus on outbreak patterns and their subsequent ecological impacts through selective
predation on coral communities. The model incorporates multiple forms of resource limitation,
process-specific efficiencies, and environmental modifiers. It uses lagged (previous time step)
values to predict current states, ensuring no data leakage. Key processes include starfish population
growth modulated by immigration and resource availability, and differential predation effects on
slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals.
