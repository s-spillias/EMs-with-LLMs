The current residuals indicate a systematic overestimation of Crown-of-Thorns starfish reproduction when total coral cover is high.  
To better capture the ecological dynamics, we have introduced an environmental damping term into the reproduction efficiency calculation:
  
    efficiency = (total_coral / (M + total_coral + 1e-8)) * exp(-theta * total_coral)

This change reflects the hypothesis that very high coral cover creates structural complexity (or other limiting effects) that reduce the effective rate of starfish reproduction.  
The new parameter "theta" quantifies this damping effect.  
Overall, this improvement is expected to reduce the reproduction overestimation and improve model fit with respect to observed dynamics.
