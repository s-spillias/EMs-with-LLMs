The current model, although capturing basic logistic growth and predation effects, shows residual patterns suggesting that coral dynamics are not being fully captured by considering each coral type in isolation. This update introduces interspecific competition between slow and fast corals by modifying the logistic growth term so that recruitment for each coral type is limited by the combined live coral cover (shared substrate limitation). This mechanism better reflects resource limitations in the reef system and is expected to improve the modelâ€™s ability to capture observed dynamics.
