The current model shows systematic residual patterns in coral predictions, suggesting that the basic logistic growth fails to capture environmental stress effects on recruitment. To improve ecological realism, we have introduced an SST-dependent modulation on coral recruitment using a new parameter beta_coral. This parameter reduces recruitment efficiency as the sea surface temperature deviates from the optimal 27Â°C, reflecting the known temperature sensitivity of coral larval settlement. This modification, using only previous time step values to avoid data leakage, should help better capture the dynamic response of coral populations to thermal stress.
