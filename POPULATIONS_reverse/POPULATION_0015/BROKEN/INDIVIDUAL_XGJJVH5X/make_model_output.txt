You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Predicting Crown of Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts through selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species).. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }

 This model predicts Crown of Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef by simulating outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts on coral communities. It focuses on the interplay between starfish population growth, environmental   
 forcing (e.g. sea-surface temperature), and selective predation on two coral types: slow‐growing Faviidae/Porites and fast‐growing Acropora species. The model incorporates multiple forms of resource limitation (saturating functions, threshold effects),  
 process-specific efficiencies, smooth transitions to avoid numerical instabilities, and feedback loops representing indirect ecological interactions.

Could you please clarify the exact content of the function signature in POPULATIONS\POPULATION_0015\INDIVIDUAL_XGJJVH5X\model.cpp that you want me to replace? In our previous change, we attempted to replace

but it appears that the current file content doesn't match that exactly. Could you share the exact lines (or a snippet) from the beginning of the file so I can craft an exact SEARCH/REPLACE block?

Below is a SEARCH/REPLACE block that inserts the TMB objective function macro call immediately after the TMB include. This block searches for the TMB include and, assuming the file starts with that line, it adds the macro declaration on the next line.

Below is a SEARCH/REPLACE block that replaces the entire content of your POPULATIONS\POPULATION_0015\INDIVIDUAL_XGJJVH5X\model.cpp file with a revised TMB model implementation. This new version uses the canonical TMB_OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION() macro and should 
resolve the compilation issues related to the undefined type and missing semicolons. Please review the changes and confirm that you want to apply them.
