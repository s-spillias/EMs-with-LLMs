This model improvement introduces an environmental sensitivity component into the Crown-of-Thorns starfish reproduction process. By incorporating a new environmental data vector (env) and the parameter gamma, the intrinsic growth rate term is modulated as r*(1 + gamma*env(t-1)), which allows the model to adjust reproduction efficiency based on past environmental conditions (e.g., temperature anomalies). This change addresses observed discrepancies in the residuals and improves the ecological realism of the model by representing an indirect feedback mechanism without data leakage.
