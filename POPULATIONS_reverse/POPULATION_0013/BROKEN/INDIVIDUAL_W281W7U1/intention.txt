Model Improvement: Coral Defensive Response

The current model shows limitations in capturing population peaks, particularly around 1990. The modified model incorporates coral defensive responses to COTS predation pressure, a well-documented ecological mechanism where corals can reduce predation efficiency through chemical and physical defenses.

Key changes:
1. Added density-dependent reduction in COTS feeding efficiency
2. Implemented through defense_factor that decreases as COTS density increases
3. This creates a stabilizing feedback that should better capture population dynamics

Expected improvements:
- More realistic predator-prey interactions
- Better representation of population peaks
- Improved capture of system resilience
