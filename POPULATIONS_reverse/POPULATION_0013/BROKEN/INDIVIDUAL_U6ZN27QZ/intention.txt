Model Improvement: Density-dependent COTS Feeding Behavior

The current model uses a simple Type II functional response for COTS predation on corals, which assumes constant feeding efficiency regardless of coral density. However, examining the model fit shows it struggles to capture sharp peaks in population dynamics, particularly around 1990-1992.

Implementation Changes:
1. Added Type III functional response with prey switching behavior
2. Incorporated density-dependent feeding efficiency that increases with total coral cover
3. Adjusted h_coral parameter to better reflect the new feeding dynamics

Ecological Justification:
- COTS are known to aggregate in areas of high coral density
- Feeding efficiency increases with coral density due to reduced search time
- Type III response better captures reduced predation at low coral densities
- Prey switching behavior reflects COTS preference shifts based on relative coral abundances

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of population peaks due to enhanced feeding at high coral density
- More realistic predator-prey dynamics at low coral density
- Improved representation of COTS aggregation effects
