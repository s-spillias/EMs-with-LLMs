Model Improvements:

Added Type III functional response for COTS predation on corals to better capture:
- Reduced predation pressure when coral cover is very low (predator switching)
- Increased efficiency at intermediate coral densities
- Saturation of predation at high coral cover
- More realistic coral mortality during COTS outbreaks

This should improve fit during outbreak periods (1990-1995) where the previous model
underestimated coral mortality.
