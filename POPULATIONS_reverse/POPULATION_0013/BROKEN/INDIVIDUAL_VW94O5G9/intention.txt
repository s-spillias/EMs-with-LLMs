Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows limitations in capturing the observed variability in coral populations, particularly for fast-growing corals. The historical data shows more dramatic fluctuations than the model predicts.

Key observation from plots:
1. Fast coral shows high variability in historical data (1985-1995) that the model underestimates
2. COTS predictions are too smooth compared to observed spikes
3. Slow coral predictions miss some major decline events

Added temperature-dependent predation efficiency because:
1. COTS feeding rates are known to vary with temperature
2. This could help explain sudden coral decline events during warmer periods
3. Maintains model parsimony while adding an ecologically justified mechanism
4. Uses existing temperature response curve (temp_effect) to modify predation pressure

The modification creates an interaction between temperature and predation pressure, which should better capture:
- Increased coral mortality during warm periods when COTS are more active
- Different vulnerability patterns between fast and slow corals
- More realistic variability in population dynamics

This change preserves the core model structure while adding a biologically meaningful temperature dependence to a key process.
