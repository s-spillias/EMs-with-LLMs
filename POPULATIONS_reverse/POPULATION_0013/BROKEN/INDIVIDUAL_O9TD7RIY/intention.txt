Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows discrepancies in capturing COTS outbreaks and coral responses, particularly during periods of high COTS abundance in the early 1990s. The model underestimates COTS impacts during these periods and produces overly smooth predictions for coral coverage.

Added temperature-dependent coral vulnerability because:
1. Thermal stress is known to weaken coral defenses and increase susceptibility to predation
2. This creates an important indirect pathway where temperature affects both COTS directly and coral vulnerability
3. The nonlinear temperature response can help capture more extreme predation events during unfavorable conditions
4. This mechanism provides ecological justification for varying predation intensity

Expected improvements:
- Better capture of COTS outbreak impacts through temperature-modified predation rates
- More realistic coral response during stress periods
- Improved representation of interaction between environmental conditions and ecological processes
