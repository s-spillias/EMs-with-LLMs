Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model shows systematic deviations in predicting coral cover dynamics, particularly during periods of rapid change (see comparison plots). The model tends to underestimate the variability in both fast and slow-growing coral populations and doesn't capture some of the observed peaks and troughs.

The addition of asymmetric competition coefficients (alpha_fast_on_slow and alpha_slow_on_fast) better represents the ecological reality of coral reef systems:

1. Fast-growing branching corals can overtop and shade slow-growing massive corals (alpha_fast_on_slow > 1)
2. Slow-growing massive corals compete through substrate occupation but have less vertical impact (alpha_slow_on_fast < 1)

This modification should:
- Better capture the differential recovery patterns between coral types
- Improve the representation of space competition dynamics
- Allow for more realistic responses to disturbances
- Help explain some of the observed oscillations in coral cover

The values chosen for competition coefficients are based on literature evidence of competitive hierarchies in coral reef systems, where fast-growing species typically have stronger competitive effects but may be more vulnerable to disturbance.
