Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- The model captures general trends but underestimates sharp COTS outbreak peaks (1990-1995)
- Coral decline predictions are smoother than observed fluctuations
- Temperature effects only influence COTS growth, not predation dynamics

Ecological Improvement:
Added temperature stress effects on predation efficiency because:
1. Stressed corals have reduced defense capabilities
2. Temperature stress can increase coral vulnerability to predation
3. COTS may preferentially target stressed corals
4. This mechanism creates stronger feedbacks during high temperature periods

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of COTS outbreak intensities during stress periods
- More realistic coral mortality during combined temperature and COTS stress
- Improved representation of ecosystem vulnerability to multiple stressors
