Model Assessment and Improvements:

Current Model Performance:
- Underpredicts COTS outbreaks in early 1990s
- Fast coral predictions are too smooth compared to observations
- Slow coral predictions miss major peak around 1990
- Model assumes constant predation efficiency regardless of coral abundance

Ecological Improvement:
Added size-dependent predation efficiency where COTS attack rates scale with coral cover. This represents:
1. Increased predator efficiency when more large colonies are available (higher % cover)
2. Different scaling between slow and fast corals due to colony morphology
3. More realistic feedback between coral abundance and predation pressure

Expected Benefits:
- Better capture of COTS outbreak dynamics through prey-dependent feeding efficiency
- More pronounced peaks in coral cover due to nonlinear predation effects
- Improved representation of differential predation between coral types
