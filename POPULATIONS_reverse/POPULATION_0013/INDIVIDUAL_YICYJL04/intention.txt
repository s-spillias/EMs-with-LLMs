This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral reef communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS population growth and immigration
2. Differential predation impacts on slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) vs fast-growing (Acropora) corals
3. Coral growth dynamics with density dependence and environmental limitations
4. Feedback mechanisms between coral cover and COTS populations

Key ecological processes include:
- Temperature effects on COTS reproduction and survival
- Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation on corals
- Logistic growth for coral recovery
- Immigration pulses of COTS larvae
- Resource competition between coral types

The model aims to predict COTS outbreak patterns and their cascading effects on reef community structure.
