This model simulates Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impacts on coral communities of the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
- Temperature-dependent growth and mortality
- Density-dependent reproduction
- External immigration pulses
- Resource-dependent survival

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
- Two distinct functional groups: slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals
- Different growth rates and COTS predation susceptibilities
- Temperature-dependent growth and mortality
- Competition between coral groups

3. Key Ecological Processes:
- Selective predation by COTS on coral species
- Temperature stress effects on both COTS and corals
- Density-dependent feedback mechanisms
- Resource limitation through coral availability
- Immigration-driven outbreak dynamics

The model uses annual time steps and incorporates both environmental forcing (sea surface temperature) and management-relevant parameters (immigration rates) to predict COTS abundance and coral cover dynamics.
