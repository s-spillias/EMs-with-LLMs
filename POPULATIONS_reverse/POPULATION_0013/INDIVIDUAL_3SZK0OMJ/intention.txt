This model simulates Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impacts on coral communities of the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
- Temperature-dependent growth and mortality
- Density-dependent reproduction
- External immigration pulses
- Resource-dependent survival

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
- Two distinct functional groups: slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals
- Different growth rates and COTS predation susceptibilities
- Temperature-dependent growth and mortality
- Space competition between coral types

3. Key Ecological Processes:
- Selective predation by COTS on different coral types
- Type II functional response in COTS feeding
- Temperature stress effects on both COTS and corals
- Density-dependent feedback mechanisms
- Immigration-driven outbreak dynamics

The model aims to predict COTS outbreak patterns and their cascading effects on coral community structure, incorporating both direct and indirect ecological interactions.
