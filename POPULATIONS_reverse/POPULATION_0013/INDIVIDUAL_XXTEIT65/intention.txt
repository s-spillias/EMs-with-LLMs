This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral reef communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS population growth and immigration
2. Differential predation impacts on slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) vs fast-growing (Acropora) corals
3. Coral growth dynamics with density dependence and environmental limitations
4. Feedback mechanisms between coral cover and COTS populations

Key ecological processes include:
- Temperature effects on COTS reproduction and survival
- Density-dependent coral growth and recovery
- Type II functional response for COTS predation on corals
- Immigration pulses that can trigger outbreaks
- Resource limitation as coral cover decreases

The model aims to predict COTS outbreak patterns and subsequent impacts on coral community composition, providing insights for reef management strategies.
