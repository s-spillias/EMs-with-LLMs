Ecological Model Intention:
This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates the dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) preying on two types of coral:
1. Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites), and
2. Fast-growing corals (Acropora).
The model integrates a growth rate and distinct predation rates for each coral type using smooth transitions (via a sigmoid function) to capture feeding behavior shifts.
A lognormal likelihood is employed to account for strictly positive observations spanning multiple orders of magnitude.
Numerical stability is ensured by adding small constants (e.g., 1e-8), and smooth penalties are applied to bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges.
