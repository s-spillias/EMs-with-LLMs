This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates the ecological dynamics of Crown‐of‐Thorns starfish predation on corals on the Great Barrier Reef. In particular, it models the effects of starfish (COTS) abundance on two coral groups: slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals. The model incorporates numerical stability via small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)), smooth transitions in equations, and smoothly penalizes parameters to remain within ecologically meaningful ranges. The likelihood calculation includes observations for both coral groups with a lognormal error structure to account for strictly positive data, and predictions are reported with the “_pred” suffix.
