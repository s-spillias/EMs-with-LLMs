Improved fit: Modified the predation effect term in coral cover dynamics. Instead of a linear reduction (1 - slope * COTS), we now use an exponential decay formulation exp(-slope * COTS) to capture saturating predation effects. This ecologically relevant adjustment is expected to improve model performance.
