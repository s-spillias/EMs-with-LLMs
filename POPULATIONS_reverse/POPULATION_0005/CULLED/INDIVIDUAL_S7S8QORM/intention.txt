Ecological improvement: Updated the coral recruitment equations to account for the negative effect of increasing COTS density. Recruitment is now modulated by an exponential decay term (exp(-recruit_inhibition * cots_pred)) with the new parameter "recruit_inhibition", thereby improving the model's ecological realism.
