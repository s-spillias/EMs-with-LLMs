Revised prediction equations to avoid data leakage by computing each response solely from previous predictions, external forcing, and parameters. Coral predictions now follow: slow_pred(i) = slow_pred(i-1) * growth_rate_slow * (1 - slow_pred(i-1)/K_slow) * (1 - impact_slow * cots_pred(i-1)) and similarly for fast corals, while COTS prediction is based on previous cots_pred, forcing (sst_dat, cotsimm_dat) and the influence of coral predictions.
