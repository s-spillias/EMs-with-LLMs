This model simulates the dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, feeding on two coral groups: slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora). The model incorporates logistic coral growth, predation by starfish, and starfish mortality. Smooth transitions, small constants for numerical stability, and smooth penalties (rather than hard constraints) ensure biologically realistic parameter ranges. Model predictions (with the '_pred' suffix) are computed for all observed data and integrated via a lognormal likelihood to account for strictly positive values.
