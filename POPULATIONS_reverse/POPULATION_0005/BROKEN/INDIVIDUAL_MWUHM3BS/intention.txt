Intention:
1. This model simulates the ecological dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) preying on two groups of corals on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing corals (Acropora) are modeled with intrinsic growth and losses due to COTS predation.
3. COTS impacts are integrated via smooth functional responses to avoid hard cutoffs, and all equations include small constants (e.g., 1e-8) for numerical stability.
4. The likelihood uses a lognormal error distribution to handle observed data spanning multiple orders of magnitude.
