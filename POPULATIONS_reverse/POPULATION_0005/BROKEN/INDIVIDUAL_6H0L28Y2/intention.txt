Ecological Model Intention:
This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates the dynamics of the Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) interacting with two coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef:
1. Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites spp.) and 
2. Fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.).

The model represents coral growth via logistic dynamics subject to reduction from COTS predation. Predation is modeled with smooth transitions and a small constant (1e-8) is included to prevent numerical issues such as division by zero. The likelihood is computed using lognormal error distributions (with a fixed minimum standard deviation) applied to strictly positive coral cover data.

Biologically meaningful parameter ranges are enforced through smooth penalties (via soft prior distributions) rather than hard constraints.
