The model simulates the feeding dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef. 
It captures the predator-prey interactions where starfish feed on two coral types:
1) Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites) and 
2) Fast-growing corals (Acropora). 
The model incorporates coral growth, natural mortality, and the consumption impact of starfish feeding.
Numerical stability and smooth transitions are ensured by incorporating small constants and smooth penalties,
and the likelihood is based on lognormal error distributions for strictly positive coral cover data.
