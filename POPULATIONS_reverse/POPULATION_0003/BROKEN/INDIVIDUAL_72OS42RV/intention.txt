Crown-of-thorns Starfish-Coral Dynamics Model

This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates the ecological functioning of the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem where crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) feed on two coral guilds:
1. Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites), which are structurally robust but exhibit low growth rates.
2. Fast-growing corals (Acropora), which recover quickly but are more susceptible to predation.

Key ecological processes modeled include:
- Coral growth and baseline cover represented by intercept parameters.
- Reduction in coral cover due to consumption by COTS, using distinct consumption rates (cslow for slow coral and cfast for fast coral).
- Smooth transitions and small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to maintain numerical stability.
- Likelihood estimation using a lognormal error distribution to account for observational uncertainty over multiple orders of magnitude.

The model is designed to integrate all observations in the likelihood calculation while penalizing biologically implausible parameter values through smooth penalties.
