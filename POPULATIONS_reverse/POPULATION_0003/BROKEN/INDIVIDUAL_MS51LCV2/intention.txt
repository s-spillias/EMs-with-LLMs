Crown-of-Thorns Starfish TMB Model Intention:
This model simulates the dynamics of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) feeding on two coral guildsâ€”
slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing corals (Acropora) on the Great Barrier Reef.
Key ecological functions include:
1. The reduction of coral cover through logistic transitions that reflect increasing predation pressure by COTS.
2. A dynamic COTS population influenced by intrinsic growth, consumption rates, and mortality.
3. Smooth numerical strategies to ensure stability (small constants and smooth penalties) while fitting observations
   of coral cover using lognormally distributed errors.
