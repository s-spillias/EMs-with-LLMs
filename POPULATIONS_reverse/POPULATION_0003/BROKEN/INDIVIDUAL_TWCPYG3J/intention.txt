The model represents the ecological interactions between Crown-of-Thorns starfish and coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef. It simulates the effect of slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) coral covers on the abundance of adult crown-of-thorns. The model uses a lognormal likelihood framework with log-transformed inputs, incorporates numerical stability adjustments, and employs smooth penalties to confine parameters to biologically realistic ranges.
