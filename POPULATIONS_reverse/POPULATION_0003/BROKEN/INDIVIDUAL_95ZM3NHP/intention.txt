This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates the ecological dynamics of crown‐of‐thorns starfish predation on the Great Barrier Reef. 
It focuses on interactions with two coral guilds: slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing corals (Acropora). 
The model incorporates:
1. Consumption dynamics via smooth (logistic) functions to represent gradual transitions and avoid numerical instabilities.
2. Likelihood calculations using lognormal error distributions for strictly positive observations, with fixed minimum standard deviations.
3. Reporting of predictions (appended with "_pred") for coral cover alongside estimated predation parameters.
Overall, the model is designed with numerical stability and biological realism in mind.
