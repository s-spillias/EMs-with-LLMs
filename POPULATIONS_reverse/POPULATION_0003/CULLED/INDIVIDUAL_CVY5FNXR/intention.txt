Crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral decline model:
1. This TMB model simulates the impact of Crown-of-Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. It focuses on the dynamics of slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals under predation pressure.
3. Coral mortality is modeled as an exponential decay modulated by temperature via a smooth, sigmoid transition.
4. Observations (coral cover) are modeled with lognormal likelihoods to account for strictly positive data and numerical stability.
    
Equations:
1. Slow coral prediction: 
   slow_pred = slow0 * exp(-decay_slow * (1 + temp_effect * sigmoid(sst, steepness, midpoint) + small_constant))
2. Fast coral prediction: 
   fast_pred = fast0 * exp(-decay_fast * (1 + temp_effect * sigmoid(sst, steepness, midpoint) + small_constant))
