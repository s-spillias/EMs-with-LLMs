This TMB model simulates the dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, with the starfish feeding on two coral groups: slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora). 
The model incorporates coral baseline cover, growth rates, and the impact of COTS predation using smooth transitions and soft penalties for biologically realistic bounds. 
Observations (coral cover and COTS abundance) are incorporated via a lognormal likelihood, ensuring numerical stability with small constants and including all data.
