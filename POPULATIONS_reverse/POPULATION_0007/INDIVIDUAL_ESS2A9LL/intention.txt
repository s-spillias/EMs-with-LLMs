Assessment and Improvement:
After evaluating the current model and the residuals, we identified systematic timing and magnitude discrepancies in the predicted COTS outbreak cycles. The model currently accounts for immigration forcing in a linear manner, which may not fully capture threshold‐triggered outbreak events. 
To better reflect the ecological dynamics (e.g., sudden launch of outbreak events when immigration is extreme), we add a quadratic immigration term. This term (cotsimm_sq_effect) allows for a nonlinear acceleration in COTS growth when immigration rates exceed typical levels, capturing the boom–bust nature of outbreaks while avoiding data leakage by only using previous time step values.
