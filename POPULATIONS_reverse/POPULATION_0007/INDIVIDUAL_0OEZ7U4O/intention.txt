Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures the boom-bust cycles of Crown-of-Thorns starfish but oversimplifies the resource limitation feedback on COTS growth by using a linear term. This linear representation does not sufficiently capture the non-linear saturation observed in nature.

Improvement:
We introduced a Hill function to represent the resource limitation feedback. By computing a ratio of the combined coral cover (slow plus fast) to the available carrying capacity and applying a power law (governed by the new parameter hill_exponent), the model can better depict the non-linear dynamics typical of ecological systems. This change allows for a more nuanced transition in feedback strength at low versus high coral cover levels, improving predictions of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration. Importantly, all predictions continue to use only prior time step values to avoid data leakage.
