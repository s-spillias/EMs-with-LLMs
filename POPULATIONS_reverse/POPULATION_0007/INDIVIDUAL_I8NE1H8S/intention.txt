Assessment:
- Residual analysis indicates that the current linear SST forcing underestimates non-linear threshold responses.
- In reality, sea surface temperature may have a non-linear influence on coral growth—with moderate values potentially promoting growth but extreme values triggering stress that limits growth. This non-linearity could be key to accurately capturing the boom–bust cycles of Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks.
Chosen Improvement:
- Add quadratic SST forcing terms to both slow- and fast-growing coral growth equations.
- The new parameters (effect_sst_slow_sq and effect_sst_fast_sq) aim to capture the non-linear environmental responses observed, thereby improving outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration predictions.
