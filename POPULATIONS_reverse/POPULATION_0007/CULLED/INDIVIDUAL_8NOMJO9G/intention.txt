Crown of Thorns Starfish Ecological Model

This model simulates the dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish feeding on slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals on the Great Barrier Reef. It incorporates smooth transitions, numerical stability constants (e.g., Type(1e-8) to prevent division by zero), and log-transformed likelihoods using a lognormal error distribution to address observed data spanning multiple orders of magnitude. Key processes include consumption dynamics captured by exponential decay functions with smooth penalties for deviations.

Equations:
1. Slow coral cover prediction: slow_pred = slow_dat * exp(-consumption_slow * cots_dat)
2. Fast coral cover prediction: fast_pred = fast_dat * exp(-consumption_fast * cots_dat)
3. Negative log likelihood: Sum of lognormal likelihoods for both coral types.
