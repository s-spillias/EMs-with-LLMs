Model Summary:
This model simulates the ecological dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef by explicitly linking the availability of coral food resources 
to both slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals. It captures the positive effects of increased coral cover on COTS population growth and 
the subsequent consumption feedback on the coral cover. The model uses smooth transitions, small constants for numerical stability, and soft penalties to bound parameters 
within biologically realistic ranges. Predictions for each observation are reported with the '_pred' suffix, and lognormal error distributions are used to stabilize variance.
