Assessment:
The current model performs reasonably well in capturing the boom-bust cycles of Crown-of-Thorns starfish, but it oversimplifies the effect of predation on corals by using a linear term. In practice, predation rates often saturate due to handling time and spatial interference. 

Chosen Improvement:
We introduce a saturating functional response for COTS predation on corals by replacing the linear terms with a saturating form. A new parameter, C_saturation, represents the coral density at which COTS feeding impact saturates. This modification ensures that as COTS densities become high, the marginal impact of predation levels off, better reflecting realistic ecological constraints.
