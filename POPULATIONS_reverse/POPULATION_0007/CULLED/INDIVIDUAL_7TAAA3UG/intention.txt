Separate coral growth and COTS predation effects additively. This modification decouples the intrinsic density‐dependent growth (modeled via logistic regulation) from the direct negative impact of COTS grazing. This change is intended to improve the model’s ability to capture coral recovery dynamics under high predation pressure.
