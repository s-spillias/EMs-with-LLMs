Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
Residuals analysis indicates that while the model captures the outbreak timing and initial magnitude, it underestimates the rapid decline following outbreak peaks. The current linear density‚Äêdependent feedback (via the `cots_density` parameter) is insufficient to capture the strong collapse phase observed in episodic outbreaks.
To address this, we have introduced a quadratic density-dependent mortality term by adding a new parameter `cots_quad`. Ecologically, this represents intensified self-limitation in COTS populations at high densities, leading to a rapid bust after an outbreak.
