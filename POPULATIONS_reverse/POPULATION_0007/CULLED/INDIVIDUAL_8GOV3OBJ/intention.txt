Assessment and Revision Rationale:
The current model captures key dynamics with previous time step predictions and external drivers; however, its linear treatment of the coral feedback on COTS growth oversimplifies ecological interactions. The residuals indicate that the model may underestimate the outbreak magnitude under high coral cover conditions. 
To address this, we now implement a non-linear saturating feedback using a tanh function. This better represents threshold effects where high coral availability can trigger rapid COTS expansion until resource limitations set in, aligning with the project context of capturing episodic outbreaks. 
This revision improves ecological realism without adding undue complexity.
