Assessment:
The current model uses recursive updates based solely on previous states and captures generic outbreak cycles; however, residual analysis indicates that the model underestimates the magnitude of outbreaks. The linear predation term (impact × cots_pred[i-1] / (1 + saturation × cots_pred[i-1])) likely oversimplifies the ecological process.
Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, predation_exponent, to allow for a non-linear (power-law) predation efficiency. Ecologically, this reflects that at low COTS densities, small increases can cause disproportionately higher coral loss, whereas at high densities, predation saturates due to factors like predator satiation. This refinement improves the model’s capacity to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events.
