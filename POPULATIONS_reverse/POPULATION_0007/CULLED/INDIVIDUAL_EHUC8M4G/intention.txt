Assessment and Improvement:
The residual analysis indicates systematic overestimation of coral loss at high COTS densities. This suggests that a linear predation term inadequately captures the diminishing impact of predation when predator density is high.
To address this, we have introduced a saturating functional response into the coral growth equations by replacing the linear predation term with:
   (impact * cots_pred[i-1]) / (h_cots + cots_pred[i-1])
This change, along with the new parameter "h_cots", better reflects the ecological dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish outbreaks and their selective predation on coral communities.
