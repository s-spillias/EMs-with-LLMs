Assessment:
Residual analysis indicated that although the current recursive relationships capture the boom‐bust dynamics, the use of strictly linear density dependence in coral growth may oversimplify the intense intraspecific competition occurring at high coral cover. To better capture this effect, we added a quadratic density‐dependent term to both slow‐ and fast‐growing coral dynamics. This non‐linear representation is ecologically justified as it represents intensified resource limitation and competition under high coral cover, potentially helping to better predict the rapid outbreak and subsequent decline of COTS populations.
