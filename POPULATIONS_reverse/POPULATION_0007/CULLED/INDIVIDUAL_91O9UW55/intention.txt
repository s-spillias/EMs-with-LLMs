Project Assessment and Model Improvement Rationale:
1. Assessment: The current model captures key dynamics but appears to underestimate the intensity and limiting feedbacks during COTS outbreaks. Residual analysis indicates systematic underprediction when densities become very high.
2. Improvement: We introduce a quadratic density-dependent mortality term (parameter "cots_quad") in the COTS dynamics. Ecologically, this term represents non-linear self-limitation (e.g. due to intraspecific competition or cannibalism) that becomes significant during outbreak phases. This additional mechanism is expected to more accurately capture the explosive boom-bust cycles observed in practice.
