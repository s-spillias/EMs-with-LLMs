Ecological model of Crown-of-Thorns starfish interactions on the Great Barrier Reef.
This model simulates how slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals are affected by feeding by Crown-of-Thorns starfish.
It includes smooth transitions, numerical stability measures (small constants, smooth penalties), and a complete likelihood calculation using a lognormal error distribution.
