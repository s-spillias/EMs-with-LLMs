Project Assessment and Proposed Improvement:
After evaluating residuals and model performance in predicting episodic COTS outbreaks, it appears that using a linear predation term oversimplifies the complex dynamics of coral consumption. In reality, as COTS density increases, the per-capita impact on coral mortality is likely to saturate due to resource limitations and behavioral changes. 
To address this, we propose replacing the linear predation terms in the coral dynamics with saturating functions:
    For slow-growing corals: impact_slow * cots_pred[i-1] becomes impact_slow * cots_pred[i-1] / (1 + saturation_slow * cots_pred[i-1])
    For fast-growing corals: impact_fast * cots_pred[i-1] becomes impact_fast * cots_pred[i-1] / (1 + saturation_fast * cots_pred[i-1])
This modification adds ecological realism by reflecting diminished per-capita predation impact at high COTS densities and better capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak cycles.
