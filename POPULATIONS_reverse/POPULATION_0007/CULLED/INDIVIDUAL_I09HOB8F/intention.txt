Project Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model fits the observed data moderately well but seems to oversimplify COTS predation by assuming a linear impact on coral cover. This linearity may overestimate predation at high COTS densities and fail to capture the natural saturation due to handling time or limited consumption ability.
To better represent the ecological dynamics and accurately capture the boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks, we introduce a saturating functional response in the predation term. In this formulation, the predation impact is modeled as:
    (impact * cots_pred[i-1]) / (1 + k * cots_pred[i-1])
where k is a saturation constant representing the declining per capita effect when COTS become very abundant.
This improvement should provide a more realistic mechanism of coral decline and allow the model to capture resource limitation effects during outbreak events.
