This update addresses the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish.
Assessment:
- The current model uses linear density-dependent mortality and direct environmental forcing.
- Residuals indicate that the model underestimates outbreak suppression at high densities.
- Ecologically, high COTS densities likely trigger additional crowding effects that limit further growth.
Improvement:
- A new quadratic density feedback term ("cots_density_feedback") is added to the COTS dynamics.
- This term represents nonlinear inhibition (crowding/resource limitation), which is critical to capture the boom-bust cycles observed in nature.
