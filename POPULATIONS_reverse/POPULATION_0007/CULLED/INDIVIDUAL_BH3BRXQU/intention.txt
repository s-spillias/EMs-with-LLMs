Assessment and Model Improvement:
1. The current model approximates coral feedback on COTS dynamics with a linear term, which may oversimplify the ecological process of resource saturation.
2. Residuals indicate that the model does not fully capture the diminishing effect of additional coral cover on supporting COTS outbreak magnitude.
3. To address this, a saturating function has been introduced in the COTS dynamics equation by adding a new parameter, lambda_coral.
4. This parameter reflects diminishing returns: at high coral cover, further increases yield reduced marginal benefits for COTS growth.
5. This modification aligns more closely with ecological realities of resource limitation and competition.
