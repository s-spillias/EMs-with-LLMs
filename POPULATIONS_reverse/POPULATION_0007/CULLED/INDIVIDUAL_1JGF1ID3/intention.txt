Assessment:
The current model fits the data reasonably well; however, the linear predation term on coral cover may overestimate coral decline at high COTS densities. This oversimplification may fail to capture the saturating effect observed in ecological systems, where incremental increases in COTS numbers yield diminishing additional coral loss. 

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a saturating functional response in the coral dynamics equations through a Michaelisâ€“Menten style term. Two new parameters, h_slow and h_fast, will serve as half-saturation constants for slow- and fast-growing corals, respectively. This adjustment will help capture the boom-bust dynamics and better represent resource limitations during COTS outbreaks.
