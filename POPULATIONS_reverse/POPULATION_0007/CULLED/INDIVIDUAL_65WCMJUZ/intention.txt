Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model captures boom-bust cycles in COTS outbreaks via density dependence, immigration forcing, and SST effects on corals.
2. However, it lacks a direct non-linear representation of SST effects on COTS dynamics. Extreme SST anomalies can trigger outbreaks by impacting coral defenses and COTS physiology.
3. To better capture outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration, we introduce additional linear and quadratic SST modifiers in the COTS dynamics.
4. This change avoids using current time step values of response data and uses only lagged predictors, ensuring no data leakage.
