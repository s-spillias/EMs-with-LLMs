Assessment:
The current model captures boom‐bust dynamics via logistic coral growth and density‐dependent COTS regulation. However, it neglects a direct environmental modifier on COTS, an omission given that elevated SST can substantially trigger outbreaks by affecting predator efficiency and COTS physiology.
Improvement:
We add a new parameter, effect_sst_cots, to model the direct influence of SST on COTS dynamics. This environmental forcing enhances COTS growth in response to higher SST, capturing the observed trigger and sustainment of outbreak events. This modification is ecologically justified by evidence that temperature anomalies can push the system into outbreak regimes.
