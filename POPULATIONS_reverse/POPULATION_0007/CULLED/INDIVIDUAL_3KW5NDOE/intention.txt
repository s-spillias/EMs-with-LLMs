Assessment and Improvement:
The current model fits the outbreak data reasonably well in terms of timing, but the linear predation term (impact * cots_pred) may lead to unrealistic predictions at high COTS densities. Residual analysis suggests a systematic deviation at high predator levels. 

To address this, we are introducing saturating predation effects using handling time parameters for both slow- and fast-growing corals. This non-linear functional response reflects ecological resource limitations—predation efficiency declines at high predator densities due to factors such as interference and limited handling capacity—providing a more robust representation of the boom‐bust dynamics observed in episodic COTS outbreaks.
