Assessment and Improvement:
The current model successfully captures many aspects of COTS dynamics using previous state values and external forcing such as SST and immigration.
However, it misses a direct resource-driven feedback whereby abundant coral cover (a key resource) enhances COTS reproduction non-linearly.
To address this, we introduce a new parameter, 'coral_effect', to represent the positive amplification of COTS growth when coral cover is high.
This change ensures that the model better captures the episodic outbreak events (boom-bust cycles) observed in Crown-of-Thorns starfish populations.
