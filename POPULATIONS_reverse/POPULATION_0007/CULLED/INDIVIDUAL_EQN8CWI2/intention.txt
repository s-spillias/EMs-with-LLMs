Assessment:
The current model captures basic outbreak dynamics but does not explicitly consider the resource (coral cover) limitation on COTS growth. Residuals indicate that at outbreak peaks and subsequent busts, the model may be improved by linking COTS growth to food availability. 

Improvement:
Introduce a resource-limitation feedback term into the COTS dynamics. This new term uses the combined predicted coral cover (slow_pred and fast_pred) relative to their total carrying capacities (K_slow and K_fast) to modulate COTS growth. When coral cover is high, it boosts the COTS growth; when low, it dampens it. This ecological mechanism helps better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
