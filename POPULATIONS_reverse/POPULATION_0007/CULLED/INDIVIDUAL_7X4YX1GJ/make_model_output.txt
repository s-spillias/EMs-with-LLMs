Below is our plan and rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Assessment and chosen improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                 

 1 The current model fits observed boom‐bust cycles moderately well but tends to overestimate the linear impact of COTS on coral cover. This can lead—especially under outbreak conditions—to an unrealistic decline in coral      
   cover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 2 The model addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT by capturing basic growth and mortality dynamics with external forcing (SST and immigration), but it oversimplifies the coral predation process by assuming a strictly linear           
   (unsaturating) COTS effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 3 An important ecological process missing is the saturating (non‐linear) effect of coral predation. Ecologically, at high COTS densities the per capita predation is expected to level off (due to limited feeding capacity,      
   handling time, or coral accessibility).                                                                                                                                                                                         

Chosen improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                
We will implement a saturating functional response by replacing the linear consumption term (impact × COTS) with a saturating form — namely:                                                                                       

impact * cots_pred / (1 + theta * cots_pred)                                                                                                                                                                                       

This change is applied separately for slow‐growing and fast‐growing coral dynamics by introducing new parameters theta_slow and theta_fast. The ecological justification is that when COTS densities become very high, the         
additional predation pressure on corals increases at a diminishing rate.

 Assessment and Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 1. The current model adequately captures the rapid outbreak (boom‐bust) dynamics of COTS but employs a linear predation term which can overshoot coral mortality during high outbreak events.                                     
 2. Ecologically, at high densities of COTS, the per capita predation rate is expected to saturate due to limits in feeding capacity or handling time.                                                                             
 3. We introduce a saturating functional response via new parameters (theta_slow and theta_fast) in the coral dynamics. This allows the predation impact to level off at high COTS densities, better capturing observed outbreak   
 patterns without data leakage (using only previous time step predictions).
