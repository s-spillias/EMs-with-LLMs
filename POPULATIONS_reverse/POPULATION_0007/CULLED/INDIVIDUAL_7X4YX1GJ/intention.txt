Assessment and Improvement:
1. The current model adequately captures the rapid outbreak (boom‚Äêbust) dynamics of COTS but employs a linear predation term which can overshoot coral mortality during high outbreak events.
2. Ecologically, at high densities of COTS, the per capita predation rate is expected to saturate due to limits in feeding capacity or handling time.
3. We introduce a saturating functional response via new parameters (theta_slow and theta_fast) in the coral dynamics. This allows the predation impact to level off at high COTS densities, better capturing observed outbreak patterns without data leakage (using only previous time step predictions).
