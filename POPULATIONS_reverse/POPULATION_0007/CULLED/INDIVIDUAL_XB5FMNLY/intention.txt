Assessment and Improvement:
1. The current model captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks reasonably by incorporating coral feedback and immigration forcing. However, it lacks a direct mechanism through which environmental conditions—specifically sea-surface temperature—can modulate COTS population dynamics.
2. Empirical observations indicate that temperature anomalies can directly affect starfish metabolism and behavior, potentially triggering outbreak events.
3. To address this, a new parameter 'sst_mod' has been introduced. It directly influences the growth rate of COTS using the previous time step's SST data, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to capture the timing and magnitude of outbreak events without using current time step response data.
