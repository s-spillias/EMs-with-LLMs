Intention Summary:
This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates the ecological functioning of Crown-of-Thorns starfish predation on the Great Barrier Reef. It specifically addresses the interactions between starfish and two coral groups:
1. Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites) – characterized by slower recovery and higher vulnerability.
2. Fast-growing corals (Acropora) – which may recover more rapidly.
The model integrates population dynamics, feeding interactions, and observation likelihoods using lognormal distributions, while employing robust numerical stability measures (e.g., small constants, smooth transitions, and smooth penalties on parameters). The goal is to predict how coral cover and starfish predation rates interact under varying conditions.
