This TMB model simulates interactions between Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) and coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef.
It specifically captures COTS feeding on slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing corals (Acropora) by incorporating
logistic growth dynamics and predation effects. Smooth numerical transitions, bounded parameter penalties, and a lognormal likelihood 
(for strictly positive data) ensure biologically meaningful estimates and numerical stability.
