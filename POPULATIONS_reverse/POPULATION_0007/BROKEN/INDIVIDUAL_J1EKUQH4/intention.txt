TMB Model Intention:
This model simulates the ecological dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) feeding on two coral types on the Great Barrier Reef:
1. Slow-growing corals (Faviidae & Porites spp.): Predation reduces percent cover while incorporating growth dynamics.
2. Fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.): Predation similarly affects cover but with faster recovery potential.
The model uses smooth penalties and small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) for numerical stability, and lognormal likelihoods to account for strictly positive observations that span multiple orders of magnitude.
Predicted values (_pred) for COTS, slow coral, and fast coral are computed and compared against observed data (_dat) in the likelihood.
