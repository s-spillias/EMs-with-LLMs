Assessment:
After analyzing the residuals and overall model performance, we observed that the reproduction term tends to be overestimated following high COTS densities. Ecologically, high population levels can deplete resources and invoke stronger top‐down controls (e.g., increased predation), thereby reducing subsequent reproduction. To address this, we added a delayed density‐dependent damping factor that uses COTS density two time steps back. This improvement better captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of the characteristic boom–bust cycles observed in Crown of Thorns outbreaks.
