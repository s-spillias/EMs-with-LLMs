Assessment:
The current model captures the essential boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks; however, residual analysis indicates systematic deviations at intermediate coral cover levels. This suggests that the saturating function based solely on total coral cover does not fully capture the nuanced influence of coral availability on COTS reproduction.

Chosen Improvement:
We introduce an optimal coral availability effect in the COTS reproduction term. A Gaussian function is applied, centered at an optimal total coral cover (mu_opt_coral) with spread defined by sigma_opt_coral. This multiplier peaks when coral cover is near the optimum and declines when coral cover deviates too far—either too low or too high—thereby better reflecting ecological reality where reproduction is most efficient under intermediate coral levels.

Justification:
In many ecological systems, resource availability has a non-linear influence on reproduction. By incorporating this Gaussian component, the model now acknowledges that both scarcity and overabundance of coral can limit COTS reproduction. This enhancement is designed to improve predictions of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration, aligning the model more closely with the observed boom-bust cycles.
