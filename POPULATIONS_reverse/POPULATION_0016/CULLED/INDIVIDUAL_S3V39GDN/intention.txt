This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. 
It predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of boom-bust cycles by dynamically linking COTS population growth 
with selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae/Porites and fast-growing Acropora). 
Key mechanisms include resource limitation via saturating functions, environmental modifiers that scale reproduction efficiency, 
and feedback loops between coral cover and COTS dynamics to emulate outbreak triggering and sustainability.
