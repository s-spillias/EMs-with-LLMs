Model Assessment Update:
1. The current model fits the observed data reasonably well by capturing the boom‚Äêbust cycles of COTS and the logistic growth of corals, with temperature modulating both processes.
2. However, an analysis of residuals suggests that the recovery dynamics of coral communities might be influenced by additional ecological interactions not yet considered.
3. In particular, the competition for space and resources between slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals is oversimplified.
4. To address this, an interspecific competition term has been incorporated into both coral dynamic equations. This term (controlled by the new parameter log_intercomp) reduces growth in each coral group in proportion to the product of their previous values, reflecting resource limitation and competitive interactions.
5. This improvement is ecologically justified because coral species competing for limited space can affect outbreak duration and recovery dynamics following COTS predation.
