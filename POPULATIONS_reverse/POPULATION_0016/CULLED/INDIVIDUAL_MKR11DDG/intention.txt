The assessment of the current model revealed that while the overall fit to the data is reasonable, the current linear functional response for coral availability in the COTS reproduction term may oversimplify key ecological dynamics. In nature, when coral cover is high, COTS can experience a super-linear increase in reproduction due to enhanced predation efficiency. To better capture the boom-bust cycles and threshold effects inherent in outbreak events, we modified the coral modifier to use a squared (higher-order) response. This change better reflects resource limitation phenomena and the non-linear escalation of COTS reproduction when coral prey is abundant.
