Assessment:
1. The model fits the data moderately well but underestimates the sharp decline of COTS reproduction when temperatures exceed the optimum.
2. The current symmetric temperature sensitivity oversimplifies ecological responses: high temperatures above the optimum can impose disproportionately stronger stress.
3. Chosen improvement: Introduce an asymmetry by adding the parameter "log_temp_skew". This parameter enhances the penalty for temperatures above the optimum, better capturing the triggering mechanisms for COTS outbreaks.
