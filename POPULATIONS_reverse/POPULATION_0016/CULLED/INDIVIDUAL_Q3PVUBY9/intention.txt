Assessment and changes:
- The current model uses a quadratic temperature effect for coral growth modulated by a linear term (via temp_poly). While this captures some non-linearity, residuals indicate that coral growth declines more abruptly with extreme temperature deviations than modeled.
- To better match the observed boom‐bust cycles of COTS outbreaks, we propose replacing the quadratic temperature response with a fourth‐order polynomial. This sharper penalty for deviations from the optimal coral growth temperature (opt_temp_coral) more accurately reflects the ecological sensitivity of coral to thermal stress.
- This change supports improved prediction of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration by linking more realistic coral dynamics to COTS predation processes.
