[Assessment]: 
The current model captures basic dynamics of COTS and coral populations, incorporating temperature modifiers and a saturating response to coral cover. However, the residuals indicate that the outbreak timing and magnitude (particularly the abrupt boom–bust cycles) are not well reproduced.

[Chosen Improvement]:
Introduce a non-linear elasticity parameter (α) in the coral functional response used in COTS reproduction. The new formulation is:
    coral_modifier = (coral_total^α) / (half_sat^α + coral_total^α)
This modification allows for a sharper threshold effect, better capturing the non-linear response likely exhibited by COTS to changes in coral cover.

[Ecological Justification]:
This change reflects the potentially disproportionate impact of small changes in coral cover on COTS reproduction, thereby improving predictions of outbreak severity and duration.
