Assessment and Reasoning:
1. The current model captures boom‐bust cycles for COTS and incorporates temperature and Allee effects. However, residuals indicate the model underestimates abrupt declines in coral recovery.
2. In particular, the model lacks explicit density‐dependent inhibition reflecting intense resource limitation at high coral cover.
3. We propose adding an extra quadratic inhibition term in the logistic growth equations for both slow and fast corals, parameterized by a new parameter "log_delta_coral". This term represents intensified competition among corals, aiding in reproducing sharp transitions between healthy and degraded coral states.
