Reasoning & Assessment (to be added in intention.txt):                                                                                                                                                                                  
Assessment: The current model captures key components driving COTS outbreak‐dynamics but oversimplifies coral interactions. In reality, slow‐ and fast-growing corals compete for space and resources. This interspecific competition   
may affect the recovery and resilience of coral communities following COTS outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                   
Chosen improvement: In the coral equations, we now introduce interspecific competition terms. For slow coral, the logistic limitation now includes the inhibitory effect of fast coral (using competition coefficient α), and vice versa
for fast coral (using competition coefficient β). This added complexity is justified ecologically by the strong role of resource competition on coral recovery and reef resilience.                                                     
• We add two new parameters (log_alpha and log_beta) to capture these competition coefficients.                                                                                                                                         
• In the coral growth terms, we now use (1 - (coral + competition*other_coral)/K) to account for both intra- and interspecific competition.                                                                                             
• We maintain the requirement to only use previous timestep values (to avoid data leakage).

 The current model captures key dynamics of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth, temperature modulation, and Type III predation responses. However, it oversimplifies coral interactions by not accounting for interspecific competiti 
 between slow-growing and fast-growing corals, which is critical for understanding the resource limitations and recovery dynamics in reef ecosystems.

 We introduce interspecific competition in the coral growth equations. For slow coral, the logistic component is modified to include the inhibitory effect of fast coral (with competition coefficient α). Similarly, for fast coral, t 
 effect of slow coral (with competition coefficient β) is incorporated. This change realistically represents the competition for space and resources, providing a more accurate depiction of coral recovery and the boom-bust cycles    
 observed during COTS outbreaks.

If you have a residuals file or any other configuration files that provide additional context (for example, how the residuals behave), please add them. Otherwise, these three files are sufficient to implement and document the       
changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

Let me know if you want to add any other files before I proceed with the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
