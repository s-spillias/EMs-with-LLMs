Assessment:
1. The current model captures key dynamics such as temperature effects and saturating coral predation, but residuals indicate systematic deviations during low coral abundance.
2. This suggests that resource limitation is oversimplified. In nature, when total coral (slow + fast) falls below a critical threshold, COTS reproduction is suppressed due to limited prey.
Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce a resource-feedback multiplier in the COTS reproduction term. This is implemented as a logistic function that reduces reproduction when coral density is below a threshold.
- Two new parameters, log_resource_feedback_k and log_resource_threshold, are added to control the sensitivity and the threshold level for this effect.
Ecological Justification:
- This mechanism captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks more accurately by simulating how low coral availability further dampens reproduction during outbreak decline phases.
