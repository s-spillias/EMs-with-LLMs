Assessment of the Model:
- The current model captures the boom‐bust dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) and its impacts on two coral groups.
- Residual analysis indicates that while seasonal and outbreak timing are reasonably captured, the saturation effect of coral cover on COTS reproduction is oversimplified.
- In particular, the simple linear saturating function does not fully capture nonlinear threshold dynamics in coral predation.

Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce a non-linear exponent in the coral modifier function. This involves replacing “coral_total” with “pow(coral_total, exponent)” in both the numerator and denominator.
- The new parameter "log_coral_modifier_exponent" (default 0, corresponding to an exponent of 1) will allow the model to flexibly adjust how sensitively COTS reproduction responds to changes in coral cover.
