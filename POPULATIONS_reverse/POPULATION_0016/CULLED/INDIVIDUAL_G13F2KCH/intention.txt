Assessment:
The current model does a reasonable job incorporating temperature effects and saturating responses for both COTS and coral dynamics; however, it oversimplifies coral interactions by modeling each coral type in isolation. In the real reef ecosystem, slow- and fast-growing corals compete for space. This interspecific competition may affect coral recovery and subsequently influence COTS outbreak dynamics.

Improvement:
Introduce interspecific competition into the logistic growth terms. Specifically, modify the slow coral growth term to incorporate a competitive effect (scaled by exp(log_competition_slow)) from fast corals, and similarly modify the fast coral growth term to include the effect of slow corals (scaled by exp(log_competition_fast)). These changes better capture feedback mechanisms and resource limitations inherent in reef ecosystems.
