Project Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Assessment: The current model captures the boom‐bust cycle of COTS with temperature effects and type III coral predation, but it does not incorporate feedback whereby sustained high COTS densities reduce the coral ecosystem's recovery potential.
2. Chosen Improvement: Introduce a dynamic reduction in coral carrying capacity by defining an effective carrying capacity:
   • Effective_K = K * exp(-kappa_coral * cots_pred(t-1))
   In this formulation, when COTS density is high, exp(-kappa_coral * cots_pred) becomes small, thereby reducing the coral’s effective carrying capacity.
3. Ecological Justification: This mechanism reflects the sustained impact of high COTS densities on coral regeneration, matching observed prolonged ecosystem degradation during outbreaks.
4. Implementation: A new parameter (log_kappa_coral) is added and used in the logistic terms for both slow and fast coral dynamics. No current time‐step _dat values are used.
