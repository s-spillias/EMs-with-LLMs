Below are the proposed changes. We are introducing a new ecological mechanism that reduces the effective coral carrying capacity as a function of the previous time‐step’s COTS density. Ecologically, during sustained COTS outbreaks, 
coral recovery is hindered by permanent or semi‐permanent habitat damage. We add a new parameter (log_kappa_coral) that modulates the effective carrying capacities (for both slow and fast coral) so that when COTS are high, the      
maximum coral cover is reduced. This change also meets the requirement of not using current time‐step _dat values (only prior time‐steps).

 Project Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                          
 -----------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                        
 1. Assessment: The current model captures the boom‐bust cycle of COTS with temperature effects and type III coral predation, but it does not incorporate feedback whereby sustained high COTS densities reduce the coral ecosystem's   
 recovery potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 2. Chosen Improvement: Introduce a dynamic reduction in coral carrying capacity by defining an effective carrying capacity:                                                                                                            
    • Effective_K = K * exp(-kappa_coral * cots_pred(t-1))                                                                                                                                                                              
    In this formulation, when COTS density is high, exp(-kappa_coral * cots_pred) becomes small, thereby reducing the coral’s effective carrying capacity.                                                                              
 3. Ecological Justification: This mechanism reflects the sustained impact of high COTS densities on coral regeneration, matching observed prolonged ecosystem degradation during outbreaks. It further supports improved timing,       
 magnitude, and duration predictions of episodes.                                                                                                                                                                                       
 4. Implementation: A new parameter (log_kappa_coral) is added and used in the logistic terms for both slow and fast coral dynamics. No current time‐step _dat values are used.

 Project Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                          
 -----------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                        
 1. Assessment: The current model captures the boom‐bust cycle of COTS with temperature effects and type III coral predation, but it does not incorporate feedback whereby sustained high COTS densities reduce the coral ecosystem's   
 recovery potential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 2. Chosen Improvement: Introduce a dynamic reduction in coral carrying capacity by defining an effective carrying capacity:                                                                                                            
    • Effective_K = K * exp(-kappa_coral * cots_pred(t-1))                                                                                                                                                                              
    In this formulation, when COTS density is high, exp(-kappa_coral * cots_pred) becomes small, thereby reducing the coral’s effective carrying capacity.                                                                              
 3. Ecological Justification: This mechanism reflects the sustained impact of high COTS densities on coral regeneration, matching observed prolonged ecosystem degradation during outbreaks.                                            
 4. Implementation: A new parameter (log_kappa_coral) is added and used in the logistic terms for both slow and fast coral dynamics. No current time‐step _dat values are used.
