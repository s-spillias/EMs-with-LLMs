Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model reasonably captures COTS dynamics and coral predation but underestimates the abrupt onset of outbreaks. An important ecological process that is currently missing is larval immigration – a connectivity effect whereby larvae arriving from neighboring reefs can trigger sudden population booms.
To address this, we introduce an immigration process in the COTS dynamics. A new parameter, log_immigration_scale, will scale the contribution of the observed larval immigration rate (cotsimm_dat), using only the previous time step’s value to avoid data leakage.
