   We'll add two new parameters (log_refuge_threshold and log_refuge_factor) with clear ecological justification.

   We'll (a) add new parameter declarations, (b) add their transformations, and (c) update the slow coral dynamics to include a refuge multiplier that enhances predation under low coral cover.

 The current model does a good job capturing the boom-bust cycles of COTS and their selective predation on coral. However, it oversimplifies the vulnerability of slow-growing coral when their cover is very low. In reality, when slo 
 coral cover falls below a critical threshold, the lack of structural complexity (“refugia”) can lead to an enhanced predation efficiency, further accelerating outbreak dynamics.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 -----------                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 We introduce a "refuge effect" in the slow coral dynamics by adding two new parameters:                                                                                                                                                
 • log_refuge_threshold: the log-transformed coral cover threshold, below which predation is amplified.                                                                                                                                 
 • log_refuge_factor: the log-transformed factor by which predation is increased when coral cover is low.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 This adjustment introduces an additional non-linear feedback that better captures the triggers and persistence of outbreak events.

 The current model does a good job capturing the boom-bust cycles of COTS and their selective predation on coral. However, it oversimplifies the vulnerability of slow-growing coral when their cover is very low. In reality, when slo 
 coral cover falls below a critical threshold, the lack of structural complexity (“refugia”) can lead to an enhanced predation efficiency, further accelerating outbreak dynamics.

 We introduce a "refuge effect" in the slow coral dynamics by adding two new parameters:                                                                                                                                                
 • log_refuge_threshold: the log-transformed coral cover threshold, below which predation is amplified.                                                                                                                                 
 • log_refuge_factor: the log-transformed factor by which predation is increased when coral cover is low.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 This adjustment introduces an additional non-linear feedback that better captures the triggers and persistence of outbreak events.
