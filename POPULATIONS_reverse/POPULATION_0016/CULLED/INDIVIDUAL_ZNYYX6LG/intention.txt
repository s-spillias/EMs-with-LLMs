Assessment:
----------
The current model does a good job capturing the boom-bust cycles of COTS and their selective predation on coral. However, it oversimplifies the vulnerability of slow-growing coral when their cover is very low. In reality, when slow coral cover falls below a critical threshold, the lack of structural complexity (“refugia”) can lead to an enhanced predation efficiency, further accelerating outbreak dynamics. 

Improvement:
-----------
We introduce a "refuge effect" in the slow coral dynamics by adding two new parameters:
• log_refuge_threshold: the log-transformed coral cover threshold, below which predation is amplified.
• log_refuge_factor: the log-transformed factor by which predation is increased when coral cover is low.

This adjustment introduces an additional non-linear feedback that better captures the triggers and persistence of outbreak events.
