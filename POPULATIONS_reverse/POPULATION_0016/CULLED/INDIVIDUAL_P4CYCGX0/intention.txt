Project Assessment and Ecological Improvement:
Our residual diagnostics indicated that the timing of the COTS outbreaks is not adequately captured by only considering immediate (t-1) coral cover. Ecologically, delayed density‐dependent effects can be important, as the influence of coral cover on COTS reproduction may lag due to resource accumulation and ecosystem inertia.
To improve the model, we add a lag effect in the coral modifier term. Specifically, for time steps t>=2, we now use a weighted average of coral cover from t-1 and t-2 to compute the available coral (i.e., coral_total). A new parameter, logit_lag_weight, (transformed via a logistic function) determines the degree of lag influence.
This modification retains the use of previous time step values only (no data leakage) while providing a more realistic representation of the delayed ecological feedbacks that can sustain or trigger outbreaks.
