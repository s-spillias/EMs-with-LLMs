Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
----------------------------------------
1. Evaluation:
   The current model uses only the immediate previous coral cover (slow_pred(t-1) + fast_pred(t-1))
   to determine the saturating effect in the COTS reproduction term. While this approach is valid,
   residuals indicate systematic deviations during rapid coral cover transitions.
2. Ecological Context:
   In reality, larval recruitment and consequent COTS reproduction are influenced by habitat quality
   over multiple preceding time steps. This delayed or cumulative resource effect is common in marine ecosystems.
3. Chosen Improvement:
   Incorporate a memory effect by computing the coral modifier using the average coral cover over the two
   previous time steps (for t â‰¥ 2). For t = 1, continue using the t-1 value.
   Specifically, compute:
      coral_total_avg = 0.5 * [ (slow_pred(t-1) + fast_pred(t-1)) + (slow_pred(t-2) + fast_pred(t-2)) ]
   This modification provides a smoother, delayed representation of resource availability,
   better capturing the trigger and sustain phases of COTS outbreaks.
