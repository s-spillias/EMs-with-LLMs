Assessment:
The current model adequately captures the timing of COTS outbreaks but tends to overestimate outbreak magnitudes. Although the saturating effect of coral cover on COTS reproduction is included, the model omits an important indirect feedback: high coral cover can support more predators that in turn increase COTS mortality.

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce an additional mortality term for COTS that scales with the previous time‑step’s total coral cover (i.e. the sum of slow and fast coral). Ecologically, this represents an indirect density‑dependent feedback where abundant coral supports predator populations that suppress COTS outbreaks. This change should help capture boom‑bust cycles more realistically.
