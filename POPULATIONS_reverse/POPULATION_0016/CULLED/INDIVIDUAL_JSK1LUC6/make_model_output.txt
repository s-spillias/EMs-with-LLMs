Below are the proposed changes. In summary, I assessed that while the current model
uses a saturating (Hill‐like) function for coral effects on COTS reproduction, the 
fixed exponent (2) does not allow enough flexibility to capture a possibly sharper 
threshold behavior. In outbreak years the residuals suggest an abrupt change in the
effect of coral abundance. To address this, I propose adding a new parameter       
("log_hill_exponent") so that the Hill exponent becomes a tunable parameter. This  
added flexibility can better capture the abrupt transitions (i.e. high             
non-linearity) in COTS outbreaks while remaining ecologically justified as a       
representation of threshold responses in predator saturation. Note that we continue
to use only previous time-step values so as to avoid data leakage.

 Assessment and Reasoning:                                                         
 After reviewing the residuals and model behavior, the current model appears to    
 underestimate the abrupt onset of COTS outbreaks. The saturating function for cor 
 availability (used as a moderator for COTS reproduction) is fixed with a Hill     
 coefficient of 2, which may be too restrictive. By introducing a tunable Hill     
 exponent parameter ("log_hill_exponent"), we can flexibly capture sharper thresho 
 responses in coral cover. This improvement allows the model to more accurately    
 represent the non‐linear feedback mechanisms that are critical in triggering and  
 sustaining outbreak events, consistent with ecological theory on predator satiati 
 and resource limitation.

Assessment and Reasoning: After reviewing the residuals and model behavior, the    
current model appears to underestimate the abrupt onset of COTS outbreaks. The     
saturating function for coral availability (used as a moderator for COTS           
reproduction) is fixed with a Hill coefficient of 2, which may be too restrictive. 
By introducing a tunable Hill exponent parameter ("log_hill_exponent"), we can     
flexibly capture sharper threshold responses in coral cover. This improvement      
allows the model to more accurately represent the non‑linear feedback mechanisms   
that are critical in triggering and sustaining outbreak events, consistent with    
ecological theory on predator satiation and resource limitation.

Assessment and Reasoning:
After reviewing the residuals and model behavior, the current model appears to 
underestimate the abrupt onset of COTS outbreaks. The saturating function for coral
availability (used as a moderator for COTS reproduction) is fixed with a Hill 
coefficient of 2, which may be too restrictive. By introducing a tunable Hill 
exponent parameter ("log_hill_exponent"), we can flexibly capture sharper threshold
responses in coral cover. This improvement allows the model to more accurately 
represent the non‑linear feedback mechanisms that are critical in triggering and 
sustaining outbreak events, consistent with ecological theory on predator satiation
and resource limitation.

 Introduce a tunable non‐linear exponent in the coral modifier. By adding a new    
 parameter (log_coral_mod_exp), the exponent applied to both the available coral a 
 the half‑saturation constant becomes adjustable. This permits the model to captur 
 higher‐order sensitivity to coral resources, thereby better representing outbreak 
 triggers.

 Introduce a tunable non‐linear exponent in the coral modifier. By adding a new    
 parameter (log_hill_exponent), the exponent applied to both the available coral a 
 the half‑saturation constant becomes adjustable. This permits the model to captur 
 higher‐order sensitivity to coral resources, thereby better representing outbreak 
 triggers.
