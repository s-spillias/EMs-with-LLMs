This TMB model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It captures the characteristic boom–bust cycles by estimating COTS population dynamics driven by reproduction (modified by available coral resources and a multiplicative environmental factor) and mortality. The model includes slow-growing coral (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing coral (Acropora spp.) dynamics, where each coral group grows logistically yet is subject to COTS predation via a saturating functional response. Key ecological processes—resource limitation, process-specific efficiencies, and environmental modifiers—are incorporated with numerical safeguards and smooth transitions to ensure stability and prevent data leakage (by using only previous time-step values in predictions).
