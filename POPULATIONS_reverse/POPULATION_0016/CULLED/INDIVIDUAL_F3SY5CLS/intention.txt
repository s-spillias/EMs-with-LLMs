Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
After evaluating the model (with reference to the residuals), it appears that the current formulation under-predicts the outbreak peaks of COTS. A key oversight is the lack of an explicit resource limitation mechanism: although coral cover is already used in a saturating (Type III) modifier for reproduction, there is no additional check to reduce reproduction when food (coral) becomes scarce.
To address this, we introduce a new ecological parameter, log_coral_limitation. This parameter quantifies a threshold of available coral cover that, when low, further suppresses COTS reproduction. The reproduction term now incorporates an extra factor:
    (coral_total / (coral_total + exp(log_coral_limitation)))
where coral_total is the sum of slow and fast coral cover from the previous time step. This adjustment ensures that when coral is scarce, reproduction is penalizedâ€”aligning with ecological theory on resource limitation. This change enhances the model's ability to predict both the intensity and duration of outbreak events while preventing data leakage by using only past time-step values.
