Below is our proposed plan:                                                        

Assessment and Chosen Improvement:                                                 
After examining the model (and guided by residuals showing systematic              
under‐prediction of outbreak peaks), it appears that the current formulation does  
not fully capture the resource limitation faced by COTS when coral cover is low.   
Although a saturating (Type III) response is already in place, we do not explicitly
reduce reproduction when coral resources become scarce. To address this, I propose 
adding an additional multiplicative factor to the COTS reproduction term that      
scales with the available coral cover (using the previous time step’s sum of slow  
and fast coral predictions). This factor will be of the form:                      
  (coral_total / (coral_total + exp(log_coral_limitation)))                        
This new parameter, log_coral_limitation, represents a threshold below which       
limited coral restricts COTS reproduction. It adds ecological realism by ensuring  
that when coral (the food resource) is scarce, it further limits the outbreak      
magnitude and duration.                                                            

We will document this rationale in intention.txt. In addition, we will update      
parameters.json to include the new parameter with clear ecological justification   
and modify model.cpp in two places:                                                

 1 Add the new parameter (and its transformation).                                 
 2 Update the reproduction calculation in the COTS dynamics loop to incorporate the
   new resource limitation factor.

 Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                       
 After evaluating the model (with reference to the residuals), it appears that the 
 current formulation under-predicts the outbreak peaks of COTS. A key oversight is 
 the lack of an explicit resource limitation mechanism: although coral cover is    
 already used in a saturating (Type III) modifier for reproduction, there is no    
 additional check to reduce reproduction when food (coral) becomes scarce.         
                                                                                   
 To address this, we introduce a new ecological parameter, log_coral_limitation.   
 This parameter quantifies a threshold of available coral cover that, when low,    
 further suppresses COTS reproduction. The reproduction term now incorporates an   
 extra factor:                                                                     
     (coral_total / (coral_total + exp(log_coral_limitation)))                     
 where coral_total is the sum of slow and fast coral cover from the previous time  
 step. This adjustment ensures that when coral is scarce, reproduction is          
 penalized—aligning with ecological theory on resource limitation. This change     
 enhances the model's ability to predict both the intensity and duration of outbre 
 events while preventing data leakage by using only past time-step values.

 Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                       
 After evaluating the model (with reference to the residuals), it appears that the 
 current formulation under-predicts the outbreak peaks of COTS. A key oversight is 
 the lack of an explicit resource limitation mechanism: although coral cover is    
 already used in a saturating (Type III) modifier for reproduction, there is no    
 additional check to reduce reproduction when food (coral) becomes scarce.         
 To address this, we introduce a new ecological parameter, log_coral_limitation.   
 This parameter quantifies a threshold of available coral cover that, when low,    
 further suppresses COTS reproduction. The reproduction term now incorporates an   
 extra factor:                                                                     
     (coral_total / (coral_total + exp(log_coral_limitation)))                     
 where coral_total is the sum of slow and fast coral cover from the previous time  
 step. This adjustment ensures that when coral is scarce, reproduction is          
 penalized—aligning with ecological theory on resource limitation. This change     
 enhances the model's ability to predict both the intensity and duration of outbre 
 events while preventing data leakage by using only past time-step values.
