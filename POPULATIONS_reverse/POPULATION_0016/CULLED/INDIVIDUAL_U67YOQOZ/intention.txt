Assessment and Improvement:
The current model fits the observed boom‚Äêbust cycles moderately well; however, the COTS reproduction term relies on a simple Type II response to coral cover. Ecologically, outbreak events are often triggered when coral availability crosses a threshold, suggesting a sigmoidal (Type III) response would be more appropriate. To capture this behavior, we introduce a Hill function by adding a new parameter, log_hill (where exp(log_hill) provides the Hill exponent). This change sharpens the response of reproduction to coral cover, ensuring that outbreaks are triggered only when sufficient coral cover is available. The added parameter is justified by literature on threshold effects in ecological systems.
