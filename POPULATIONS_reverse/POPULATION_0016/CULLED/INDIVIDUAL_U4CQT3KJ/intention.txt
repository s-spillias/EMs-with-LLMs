Assessment:
The current model effectively captures many dynamics of COTS outbreaks, yet residual analysis suggests that coral recovery after high COTS densities is overestimated. This is likely due to an oversimplified logistic growth term for coral that does not account for cumulative damage from outbreaks.

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a new parameter, "log_damage", to represent the delayed recovery of corals due to cumulative damage from high COTS densities. In the coral dynamics equations, we will modify the logistic growth term by multiplying it by exp(log_damage * previous_COTS_density). Ecologically, a more negative log_damage value reflects stronger suppression of coral recovery following outbreaks, yielding more realistic boomâ€“bust cycles.
