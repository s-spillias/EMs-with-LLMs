Assessment:
The current model incorporates a saturating effect of coral cover on COTS reproduction; however, the present linear function may not adequately capture the rapid decline in available food when coral cover becomes critically low.

Chosen Improvement:
We have updated the coral modifier in the reproduction term to a quadratic saturating function. This modification means that as coral cover diminishes, the available food declines more sharply, thus reducing the COTS reproduction rate markedly. This indirect feedback loop better represents resource limitation and aligns with observed boom-bust dynamics in COTS outbreaks.

Ecological Justification:
In outbreak scenarios, when coral cover drops significantly, the food shortage for COTS becomes a critical factor limiting reproduction. The quadratic relationship provides a more realistic transition from abundant to scarce food resources, resulting in more accurate timing, magnitude, and duration of the outbreak cycles.
