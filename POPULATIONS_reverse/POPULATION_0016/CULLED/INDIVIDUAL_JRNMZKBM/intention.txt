Assessment and improvement rationale:
--------------------------------------
The current model uses a Michaelis–Menten type (Type II) functional response for coral predation,
which assumes a saturating effect of coral cover on COTS reproduction and predation.
However, field evidence and ecological theory suggest that predation by COTS on corals may exhibit
a sigmoidal (Type III) response: predation efficiency is low when coral cover is very low (due to prey refugia),
and increases sharply past a threshold.
This modification better captures the boom‐bust dynamics observed in episodic outbreaks.
The model has been updated to square coral cover in the predation terms, thereby implementing a Type III response.
