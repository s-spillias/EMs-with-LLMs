Assessment and Improvement:
Based on analysis of the residuals, the quadratic temperature effect in coral growth is not sufficiently capturing the abrupt decline in coral cover during extreme temperature deviations. Ecological observations indicate that under extreme thermal stress, coral growth rapidly declines in a non-linear fashion. To address this, we have introduced an additional cubic temperature modifier. This higher‐order term better represents the non‐linear, severe impact of extreme temperatures on coral growth, thereby improving the model's ability to simulate the observed boom‐bust cycles in COTS outbreaks.
