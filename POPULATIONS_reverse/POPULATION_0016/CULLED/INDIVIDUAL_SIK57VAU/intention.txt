Project Assessment and Ecological Improvement:

Current model evaluation indicates that although the model somewhat captures the boom‐bust cycles of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) and its predation on coral, residual analysis suggests that at high coral cover the model overestimates COTS predation. This likely reflects the absence of a mechanism for coral “refugia,” whereby high coral density decreases effective predation due to factors such as structural complexity or mutual protection.

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a variable efficiency (refugia) effect on COTS predation.
A new parameter, log_refugia_alpha, is added so that predation on coral is reduced as the sum of slow and fast coral increases. The predation function is modified as follows:
  predation *= exp(-refugia_alpha * (slow_pred(t-1) + fast_pred(t-1)))
  
Ecological Justification:
Higher coral cover can offer refuge to individual corals, thereby reducing effective COTS predation and providing a self-moderating feedback on outbreak magnitude.

This modification is expected to improve the model’s ability to capture the dampening of COTS outbreaks when coral density is high.
