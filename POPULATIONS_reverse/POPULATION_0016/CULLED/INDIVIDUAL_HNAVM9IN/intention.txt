Assessment:
- The current model captures key outbreak dynamics through allee effects, saturating predation, and logistic coral growth.
- However, while slow-growing corals include a cumulative damage mechanism, fast-growing corals do not.
- Residual analysis indicates that during high COTS density periods, the decline in fast coral cover is underestimated.

Reasoning for improvement:
- To better capture the boom-bust dynamics and the impact of sustained COTS pressure, a non-linear damage term is introduced for fast coral.
- This term reduces fast coral cover more sharply when COTS densities are high, thereby reflecting potential catastrophic loss during prolonged outbreaks.
