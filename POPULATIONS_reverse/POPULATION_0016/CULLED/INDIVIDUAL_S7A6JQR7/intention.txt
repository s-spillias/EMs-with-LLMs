Assessment and Improvement Plan:
1. The current model moderately captures outbreak dynamics but oversimplifies the interactions between slow-growing and fast-growing corals.
2. In natural reef ecosystems, interspecific competition for limited substrate can significantly influence coral growth and recovery.
3. We introduce an interspecific competition term in both coral dynamics by adding a new parameter, "log_competition_coef", that scales the negative effect of the competing coral group.
4. This modification does not use current time step values, ensuring no data leakage.
5. The change is ecologically justified as it better reflects the resource limitation and competitive interactions shaping reef dynamics.
