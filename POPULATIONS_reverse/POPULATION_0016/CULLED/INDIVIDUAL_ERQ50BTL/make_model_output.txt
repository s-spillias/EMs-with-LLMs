Below are the proposed changes. I've chosen to improve the ecological realism of   
the slow coral dynamics by replacing the quadratic damage term with a non‐linear,  
saturating function (the hyperbolic tangent). This change better captures the      
threshold behavior in coral tissue damage – once COTS predation exceeds a certain  
level, damage escalates rapidly. In addition, I add a new parameter                
log_damage_threshold to specify the point at which the damage effect saturates.    
This improvement also addresses the need to capture the boom‐bust dynamics while   
preventing data leakage by using only previous time step values.

 The current model uses a quadratic damage term in the slow coral dynamics, which  
 may not fully capture the rapid transition to catastrophic coral loss during high 
 COTS outbreaks. The residuals indicate that the model underestimates coral loss   
 during extreme predation events.                                                  
                                                                                   
 Proposed improvement:                                                             
 Replace the quadratic damage term with a saturating function—using the hyperbolic 
 tangent—to represent a threshold effect on coral damage. This allows the damage t 
 escalate non‐linearly once COTS predation exceeds a critical threshold. A new     
 parameter,                                                                        
     "log_damage_threshold",                                                       
 will be added to govern this threshold.                                           
                                                                                   
 Ecological justification:                                                         
 Introducing a non‐linear damage term captures the feedback mechanism where, after 
 critical predation intensity, coral tissue damage escalates rapidly, contributing 
 to the boom‐bust cycles observed in empirical data. This improved representation  
 aligns with the project context of modelling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorn 
 starfish on the Great Barrier Reef.

 The current model uses a quadratic damage term in the slow coral dynamics, which  
 may not fully capture the rapid transition to catastrophic coral loss during high 
 COTS outbreaks. The residuals indicate that the model underestimates coral loss   
 during extreme predation events.                                                  
                                                                                   
 Proposed improvement:                                                             
 Replace the quadratic damage term with a saturating function—using the hyperbolic 
 tangent—to represent a threshold effect on coral damage. This allows the damage t 
 escalate non‐linearly once COTS predation exceeds a critical threshold. A new     
 parameter, "log_damage_threshold", will be added to govern this threshold.        
                                                                                   
 Ecological justification:                                                         
 Introducing a non‐linear damage term captures the feedback mechanism where, after 
 critical predation intensity, coral tissue damage escalates rapidly, contributing 
 to the boom‐bust cycles observed in empirical data. This improved representation  
 aligns with the project context of modelling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorn 
 starfish on the Great Barrier Reef.
