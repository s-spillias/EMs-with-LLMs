Assessment:
The current model uses a quadratic damage term in the slow coral dynamics, which may not fully capture the rapid transition to catastrophic coral loss during high COTS outbreaks. The residuals indicate that the model underestimates coral loss during extreme predation events.

Proposed improvement:
Replace the quadratic damage term with a saturating function—using the hyperbolic tangent—to represent a threshold effect on coral damage. This allows the damage to escalate non‐linearly once COTS predation exceeds a critical threshold. A new parameter, "log_damage_threshold", will be added to govern this threshold.

Ecological justification:
Introducing a non‐linear damage term captures the feedback mechanism where, after a critical predation intensity, coral tissue damage escalates rapidly, contributing to the boom‐bust cycles observed in empirical data. This improved representation aligns with the project context of modelling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef.
