Assessment and Improvement Strategy:

1. Model Fit: Residuals indicate that while the model captures the explosive dynamics of COTS and the boom-bust cycles, predictions for slow coral recovery are overly optimistic when coral cover is very low.

2. Ecological Context: Observations suggest that extremely low coral cover can lead to reduced larval settlement and recruitment, hindering coral recovery. This is consistent with Allee effects observed in ecological systems.

3. Chosen Improvement: We introduce a coral recruitment Allee effect by adding a sigmoidal modifier to the slow coral logistic growth term. This modifier downscales coral recruitment at low coral densities, thereby incorporating a realistic threshold below which coral recovery is severely limited.

4. Parameter Addition: A new parameter, log_allee_coral, represents the log-transformed coral recruitment threshold. Its inclusion adds ecological realism by suppressing coral recovery when the coral cover falls below a critical level.
