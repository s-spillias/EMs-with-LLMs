Below are the proposed changes. We are adding a density‐dependent competition term in the COTS dynamic to better capture boom‐bust behavior. This term introduces a quadratic penalty on high COTS densities                            
that—ecologically—represents resource limitation/overcrowding effects. We also document our assessment and reasoning in intention.txt and add a new parameter (log_comp_COTS) with appropriate justification in parameters.json. In     
addition, we update the model implementation in model.cpp by (1) declaring and transforming the new parameter and (2) subtracting the competition term in the COTS update equation.

 The residuals indicate that while the current model fits many aspects of the data, its representation of COTS dynamics is overly simplistic.                                                                                           
 The model does not incorporate density‐dependent competition effects that can trigger the abrupt bust following outbreaks.                                                                                                             
 To better capture the characteristic boom‐bust cycles observed in Crown of Thorns populations,                                                                                                                                         
 a density‐dependent competition term has been introduced into the COTS dynamic.                                                                                                                                                        
 This term (proportional to the square of the previous COTS density) reflects resource limitation and overcrowding, reducing reproduction success at high densities.                                                                    
 This improved formulation is ecologically justified and aligns with the project context emphasizing the triggers and feedbacks in outbreak dynamics.

 The residuals indicate that while the current model fits many aspects of the data, its representation of COTS dynamics is overly simplistic. The model does not incorporate density‐dependent competition effects that can trigger the 
 abrupt bust following outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 To better capture the characteristic boom‐bust cycles observed in Crown of Thorns populations, a density‐dependent competition term has been introduced into the COTS dynamic. This term, proportional to the square of the previous   
 COTS density, represents resource limitation and overcrowding effects that reduce reproduction success at high densities.                                                                                                              
 This improved formulation is ecologically justified and aligns with the project context emphasizing the triggers and feedbacks in outbreak dynamics.
