Project Assessment and Improvement:
-----------------------------------
The residuals indicate that while the current model fits many aspects of the data, its representation of COTS dynamics is overly simplistic. The model does not incorporate density‐dependent competition effects that can trigger the abrupt bust following outbreaks.
To better capture the characteristic boom‐bust cycles observed in Crown of Thorns populations, a density‐dependent competition term has been introduced into the COTS dynamic. This term, proportional to the square of the previous COTS density, represents resource limitation and overcrowding effects that reduce reproduction success at high densities.
This improved formulation is ecologically justified and aligns with the project context emphasizing the triggers and feedbacks in outbreak dynamics.
