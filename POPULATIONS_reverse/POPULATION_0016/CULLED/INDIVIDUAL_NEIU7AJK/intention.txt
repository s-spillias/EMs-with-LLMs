Assessment and Improvement:
1. The current model captures the core dynamics of COTS outbreaks and coral interactions but shows residual discrepancies in outbreak magnitude and duration.
2. One oversimplification is the fixed quadratic (exponent = 2) form used in the coral cover modifier on COTS reproduction, which may not adequately represent sharp thresholds observed ecologically.
3. To improve realism, we introduce a flexible exponent (log_coral_modifier_exponent) that allows the saturating effect of coral cover on COTS reproduction to be tuned. This non-linear response better captures the abrupt transition in reproduction rates when coral cover exceeds a critical threshold.
4. This modification maintains the use of past time-step values only, ensuring no data leakage.
