Assessment:

The current model fits part of the observed data; however, it oversimplifies larval settlement by using only the immediate previous coral cover (t‑1). 
Ecologically, larval settlement is often influenced by habitat conditions from an earlier time (t‑2), meaning any shortage of coral cover can delay recruitment and thus reinforce outbreak dynamics.
To better capture the boom‐bust cycles of COTS, we introduce a new parameter (log_settlement_effect) that scales a settlement modifier computed from coral cover at t‑2.
This adjustment aims to model resource limitations and delayed recruitment effects, improving the simulation of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
