Assessment: The current model effectively captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS, yet the linear approach to coral damage may underestimate catastrophic coral loss during outbreaks. 

Improvement: We introduce a non-linear damage mechanism for slow-growing corals by squaring the ratio of COTS density to coral carrying capacity (K_slow) in the damage term. This reflects that, beyond a threshold, increased COTS density leads to disproportionately higher coral mortality, enhancing ecological realism in capturing outbreak dynamics.
