Improved Model Intentions:
Assessment: The current model captures the basic boom‐bust dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish using logistic growth and a Type III predation response. However, larval immigration—a key ecological driver—is currently omitted.
Improvement: Incorporated an immigration term by adding cotsimm_dat(t-1) to the COTS dynamics equation. This addition uses only previous time-step data to avoid data leakage.
Justification: Including larval recruitment better aligns with observed episodic outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef, as external recruitment can critically influence the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
