Assessment:
The current model captures the boom‚Äêbust dynamics of COTS and coral via logistic growth and predation. However, it oversimplifies the ecological response of corals to high sea-surface temperatures. In real reef systems, extreme thermal stress causes bleaching-induced mortality, leading to rapid coral loss. This loss can in turn trigger or exacerbate COTS outbreaks.
Chosen Improvement:
Include an explicit bleaching mortality term for both slow and fast coral. When sea-surface temperature (sst) exceeds the optimal coral temperature (opt_temp_coral), coral mortality increases proportionally.
New Parameters:
- log_bleaching_slow: Log coefficient for bleaching mortality for slow coral.
- log_bleaching_fast: Log coefficient for bleaching mortality for fast coral.
This improvement provides a mechanistic pathway for abrupt coral declines during thermal stress, better reflecting the dynamics observed on the Great Barrier Reef.
