Assessment and Improvement:
The current model captures boom-bust cycles of COTS and coral dynamics well using logistic and Michaelis-Menten formulations.
However, the linear response of COTS reproduction to previous sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies may overestimate impacts and does not capture the ecological thresholds observed empirically.
To improve ecological realism, we introduce a nonlinear, saturating response (using tanh) in the SST multiplier.
This change better reflects that COTS reproduction increases with SST anomalies up to a threshold and then saturates, aligning with observed outbreak triggers.
