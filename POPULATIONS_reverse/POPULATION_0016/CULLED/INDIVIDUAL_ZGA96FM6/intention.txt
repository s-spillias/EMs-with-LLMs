PROJECT CONTEXT Assessment:
1. The current model generally captures the outbreak dynamics via reproduction, mortality, and logistic coral growth. Residuals indicate that while the overall patterns are reproduced, the predation response appears oversimplified.
2. The model treats both slow-growing and fast-growing corals with a single flexible predation exponent. In reality, these groups likely experience different predation pressures due to differences in structure and recovery dynamics.
3. To enhance ecological realism and better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, we introduce separate non‚Äêlinear predation exponents (log_pred_exponent_slow and log_pred_exponent_fast) for slow and fast coral. This change allows differential tuning of predation responses.
