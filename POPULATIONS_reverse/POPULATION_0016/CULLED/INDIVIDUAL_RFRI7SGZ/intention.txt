Assessment and Improvement for COTS Outbreak Model:

1. Assessment:
   - The current model captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth and type III predation.
   - Residuals indicate systematic discrepancies, suggesting the coral dynamics are oversimplified.
   - The model correctly avoids data leakage by using only previous time-step values.

2. Chosen Improvement:
   - Introduce an interspecific competition term between slow-growing and fast-growing corals.
   - A new parameter, log_beta, will be added. Its exponential value (beta) will reduce coral growth when the other coral type is abundant.
   - Ecological Rationale: Coral species compete for space and resources. Including this competition improves the model's ability to capture boom-bust dynamics by reflecting resource limitation.
