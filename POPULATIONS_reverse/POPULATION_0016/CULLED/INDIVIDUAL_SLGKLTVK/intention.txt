This update assesses the current model and its ability to capture the rapid outbreak onset of Crown of Thorns starfish. The residuals suggest that the Gaussian temperature effect is too smooth. To better capture the sharp triggering of outbreaks, we add a polynomial modifier to the temperature effect on COTS reproduction. This factor (controlled by a new parameter, log_cots_poly_coeff, with exp(log_cots_poly_coeff) = cots_poly_coeff) enhances reproduction when the deviation from the optimal temperature is nonzero. This additional nonlinearity provides a more realistic environmental tipping‚Äêpoint mechanism within the model.
