Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures observed dynamics using temperature effects, Allee effects, and logistic growth for coral populations. However, the mechanism for rapid outbreak amplification of COTS when coral cover is high is oversimplified.

Improvement:
Introduce a new parameter (log_gamma_COTS) to modulate COTS reproduction via a non‚Äêlinear tanh function applied to (coral_total - half_sat). This addition amplifies reproduction when total coral cover exceeds the half-saturation threshold, providing a threshold-driven outbreak mechanism that is ecologically plausible.

Ecological Justification:
A positive gamma_COTS increases reproduction non-linearly when coral cover is abundant, capturing an ecological feedback that promotes the boom phase of COTS outbreaks.
