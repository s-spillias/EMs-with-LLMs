Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. Evaluation: The current model captures the basic COTS, slow coral, and fast coral dynamics; however, residual analysis indicates systematic underprediction during outbreak periods.
2. Issue: The model lacks an explicit process for COTS larval immigration despite having the cotsimm_dat input available.
3. Ecological justification: Larval immigration is critical for triggering explosive outbreak events and should be incorporated to better reflect the rapid population increases observed in nature.
4. Change: The COTS dynamics equation is updated to include an additive immigration term (cotsimm_dat from the previous timestep). This change avoids data leakage by strictly using t-1 values.
