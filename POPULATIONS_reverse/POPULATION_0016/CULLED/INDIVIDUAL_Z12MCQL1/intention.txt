Assessment and Improvement:
The current model captures outbreak dynamics and coral predation with a linear coral_modifier. However, residuals indicate that the model underestimates outbreak magnitudes at intermediate coral levels. This suggests that the influence of coral cover on COTS reproduction is non‚Äêlinear.
To address this, we introduce a new parameter ("log_beta_COTS") that exponentiates the coral_modifier (i.e. using pow(coral_modifier, beta_COTS)). Ecologically, this change captures threshold effects where even small increases in coral cover can lead to disproportionate increases in reproduction under outbreak conditions.
