Assessment:
- The current model captures basic COTS outbreak dynamics and logistic coral recovery; however, it misses the ecological effect of lasting coral damage from high COTS predation.
- Relying solely on standard logistic growth for coral oversimplifies recovery, ignoring that severe outbreaks can inflict damage that delays recovery.
Chosen improvement:
- Introduce a new damage sensitivity factor. By multiplying the intrinsic coral growth terms by exp(-damage_coef * cots_pred(t-1)), we simulate reduced coral recovery when previous COTS density is high.
Ecological justification:
- Field observations indicate that after an outbreak, coral recovery is slower due to persistent damage. This modification better represents the delayed recovery seen in reef ecosystems.
