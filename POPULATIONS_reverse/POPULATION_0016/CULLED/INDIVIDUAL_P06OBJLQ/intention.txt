Assessment and Proposed Improvement:
-------------------------------------
The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of Crown of Thorns (COTS) outbreaks but appears to overestimate predation on coral communities when coral cover is already low. Ecologically, when coral cover falls below a critical threshold (a fraction of the carrying capacity), encounter rates between COTS and corals decrease and predation efficiency should diminish. 

To address this, we introduce a density-dependent predation efficiency factor that modulates the effective predation rate on both slow and fast corals. A logistic function is used where the efficiency decreases when coral cover falls below a threshold (parameterized by exp(log_cor_thr)). This mechanism better captures the feedback dynamics and helps to sustain realistic coral recovery following an outbreak.
