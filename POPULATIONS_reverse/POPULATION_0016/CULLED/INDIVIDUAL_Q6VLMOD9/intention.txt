Assessment and Chosen Improvement:
The current model robustly captures several key dynamics (logistic coral growth, type‑III predation, density‑dependent regulation, and temperature effects). However, an important ecological process is missing: larval immigration. External larval recruitment can trigger and sustain COTS outbreaks by rapidly increasing their numbers, which is critical to accurately predict the characteristic boom–bust cycles.
To improve model fidelity, we introduce a larval immigration term in the COTS dynamics (using the previous time step’s cotsimm_dat to avoid data leakage). A new parameter, log_immigration_effect, scales the contribution of larval recruitment, thereby providing an external recruitment pathway that better captures outbreak triggers.
