Assessment and Improvement:
The current model adequately incorporates saturating predation and logistic coral dynamics, but residual analysis indicates that the slow coral recovery after severe COTS outbreaks is overestimated. Ecologically, when slow coral cover falls below ~20% of its carrying capacity, recovery should be strongly inhibited due to cumulative damage and limited recruitment. To address this, we add a recovery inhibition mechanism via a new parameter (log_coral_recovery_inhibition) that systematically reduces slow coral growth when coral cover is low, thereby capturing the prolonged recovery dynamics observed after outbreaks.
