Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
----------------------------------------------
Residual analysis indicates that the current model occasionally underestimates the saturation in COTS predation on coral during outbreak events. The existing formulation uses a single half‐saturation parameter (log_half_sat) for both the coral modifier in COTS reproduction and the functional response in coral predation. This conflates two distinct ecological processes.
To more accurately capture the system dynamics, we propose adding a separate half‐saturation constant for predation (log_half_sat_pred). This change allows the model to independently adjust the non-linear (Type III) predation response, representing how predation efficiency saturates with increasing coral cover. This ecological mechanism is important for modeling the boom-bust dynamics of Crown of Thorns outbreaks, where high coral densities may lead to a disproportionate reduction in predation efficiency.
