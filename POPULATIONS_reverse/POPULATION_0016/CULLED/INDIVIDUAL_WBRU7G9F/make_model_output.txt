Below is our plan with a single ecological improvement: we add non‐linear (Holling type II) predation terms for coral decline. This addresses the observed shortcomings (an oversimplified linear predation response) and better        
captures a saturating effect due to handling times. We add two new parameters (log_h_slow and log_h_fast) to represent the handling time constants in predation on slow‐ and fast-growing corals, respectively. We modify the model’s   
coral update equations to use these parameters and update the intention.txt file with our assessment and reasoning.

 The current model fits the data reasonably well but oversimplifies the predation dynamics by using a linear response. In reality, predation is limited by handling times, which causes a saturation in the predation rate at high COTS 
 densities. To address this, we have modified the coral update equations to use a Holling type II functional response. Two new parameters (log_h_slow and log_h_fast) have been introduced to represent the log handling time constants 
 for slow- and fast-growing coral predation, respectively. This change should result in a more realistic depiction of the outbreak dynamics and subsequent coral decline.

 The current model fits the data reasonably well but oversimplifies the predation dynamics by using a linear response. In reality, predation is limited by handling times resulting in a saturation effect at high COTS densities. To   
 address this, we have modified the coral update equations to use a Holling type II functional response. Two new parameters (log_h_slow and log_h_fast) have been introduced to represent the log handling time constants for slow- and 
 fast-growing coral predation, respectively. This change should yield a more realistic depiction of the outbreak dynamics and subsequent coral decline.

These updates implement a Holling type II response for coral predation, which accounts for saturation effects due to handling times. If you have any other files (or further adjustments) impacting the model dynamics, please add them,
and I’ll assist further.
