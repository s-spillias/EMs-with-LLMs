Assessment and Improvement:
The current model fits the data reasonably well but oversimplifies the predation dynamics by using a linear response. In reality, predation is limited by handling times resulting in a saturation effect at high COTS densities. To address this, we have modified the coral update equations to use a Holling type II functional response. Two new parameters (log_h_slow and log_h_fast) have been introduced to represent the log handling time constants for slow- and fast-growing coral predation, respectively. This change should yield a more realistic depiction of the outbreak dynamics and subsequent coral decline.
