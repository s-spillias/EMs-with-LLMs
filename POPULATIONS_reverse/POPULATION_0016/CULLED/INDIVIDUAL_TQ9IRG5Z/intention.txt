Project Intention and Model Improvement:

Assessment:
- The current model fits the data reasonably well in terms of timing and magnitude of Crown of Thorns outbreaks.
- The model addresses key processes (predation, logistic coral growth, and temperature effects) but uses a symmetric quadratic form for temperature deviation effects on coral growth.
- Ecologically, coral growth responses to temperature anomalies can be strongly asymmetric, with extreme high temperatures causing disproportionately greater stress.

Chosen improvement:
- We introduce an additional cubic term to the temperature deviation multiplier in coral growth equations.
- This higher-order term captures the asymmetric impact of temperature extremes on coral growth.
- A new parameter, "log_coral_temp_cubic", is added to control the strength of the cubic effect, allowing flexibility in model tuning.
