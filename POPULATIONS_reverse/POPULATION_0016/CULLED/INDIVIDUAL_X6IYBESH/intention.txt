Project Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Model Fit: Residuals indicate a potential mismatch in outbreak onset timing. The fixed steepness of the Allee effect limits the modelâ€™s ability to capture natural variability in low-density reproduction.
2. Ecological Context: While the current model captures boom-bust dynamics and selective coral predation, the mate-finding process is oversimplified by a hard-coded steepness.
3. Improvement: Introducing the tunable parameter "log_allee_steep" allows the model to flexibly adjust the steepness of the Allee effect. This adjustment enhances the representation of outbreak triggers by refining the sensitivity of COTS reproduction to low densities.
