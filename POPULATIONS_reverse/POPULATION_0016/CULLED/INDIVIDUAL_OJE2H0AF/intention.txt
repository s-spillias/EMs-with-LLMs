Assessment:
The residuals indicate that some outbreak events are underestimated. The current model does not account for variability in larval recruitment, a key driver of sudden COTS outbreaks. 

Improvement:
Incorporate larval immigration by adding the available data vector cotsimm_dat (using its previous time-step value) into the COTS dynamics. This addition reflects that larval supply variability can trigger outbreak events and sustain high population levels temporarily.

Ecological Justification:
Larval recruitment variability is an important factor in the boom-bust cycles of COTS populations. By including this factor, the model better captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks while avoiding data leakage.
