Assessment:
The residuals indicate that while the model captures the basic boom‐bust cycle of COTS outbreaks, it underestimates the lag in coral recovery following periods of intense COTS predation. Ecologically, stressed coral communities exhibit reduced recruitment and slower recovery after severe predation events.

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a recovery modifier in the coral dynamics. This modifier reduces the effective coral growth rate when the previous coral cover is low, thereby capturing cumulative stress effects and a delayed recovery. 

New Parameter:
log_recovery_modifier – A log-scaled factor controlling the degree to which low coral cover impairs recovery. Values < 0 correspond to stronger recovery inhibition.
