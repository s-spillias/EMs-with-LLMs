Assessment and Improvement:
The current model uses a saturating function to model the effect of coral cover on COTS reproduction, but it does not explicitly account for resource limitation when coral prey is scarce. Empirical observations suggest that COTS outbreaks are curtailed when overall coral cover (both slow and fast-growing species) drops significantly. 
Ecological reasoning:
• COTS reproduction should be limited directly when prey (coral) availability is low.
• Adding a prey_availability factor—computed as (slow_pred + fast_pred) divided by (K_slow + K_fast)—captures this resource limitation.
Proposed improvement:
Multiply the reproduction term by prey_availability computed from previous time-step coral densities.
