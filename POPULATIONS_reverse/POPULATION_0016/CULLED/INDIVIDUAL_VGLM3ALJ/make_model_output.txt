Below are the changes I propose:                                                   

Summary:                                                                           

 1 In parameters.json we add a new parameter log_damage_fast with ecological       
   justification. Fast-growing corals are also subject to cumulative damage from   
   high densities of COTS. This damage feedback is analogous to the already‐present
   term on slow corals, and its addition should improve model predictions during   
   outbreak peaks.                                                                 
 2 In model.cpp we add the new parameter declaration, transform it to its natural  
   scale, and incorporate it in the fast coral dynamics equation.                  
 3 In intention.txt we update the file with our assessment and reasoning for the   
   change.

 Assessment:                                                                       
 The residuals indicate that while the model captures many dynamics of COTS        
 outbreaks, there is a systematic bias in the prediction of fast coral cover. This 
 suggests that the current model underestimates the cumulative damage to           
 fast-growing coral species during intense COTS outbreaks.                         
                                                                                   
 Reasoning:                                                                        
 To address this, I have introduced a new parameter, log_damage_fast, into the fas 
 coral dynamics. This new term represents cumulative tissue damage to fast coral d 
 to high COTS densities, analogous to the existing damage term applied to slow     
 coral. This modification is ecologically justified since fast coral, despite thei 
 high growth rate, are also susceptible to severe impacts when COTS predation is   
 intense. The added feedback mechanism is expected to better capture the boom-bust 
 cycles by reducing fast coral cover more accurately during outbreak peaks, thereb 
 improving the overall model fit and ecological realism.

 =======                                                                           
 Assessment:                                                                       
 The residuals indicate that while the model captures many dynamics of COTS        
 outbreaks, there is a systematic bias in the prediction of fast coral cover. This 
 suggests that the current model underestimates cumulative damage to fast-growing  
 coral species during intense COTS outbreaks.                                      
                                                                                   
 Reasoning:                                                                        
 To address this, a new parameter, log_damage_fast, has been introduced into the   
 fast coral dynamics. This term represents cumulative tissue damage to fast coral  
 due to high COTS densities, analogous to the existing damage term for slow coral. 
 Incorporating this feedback mechanism improves the ecological realism and should  
 better capture the boom-bust cycles observed during outbreak peaks.
