This revision improves the ecological realism of the model for episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish. Analysis of the residuals indicated that the current model overestimates coral recovery at very low coral cover levels. To address this, an Allee effect for coral recovery has been introduced. When coral cover is below a critical threshold (allee_coral), coral recruitment and growth are limited, reflecting recruitment failure in sparse populations. This modification enhances the model’s ability to capture the observed boom–bust dynamics by effectively reducing coral regrowth immediately after severe outbreaks.
