Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model fits the observed data moderately well but does not explicitly capture the lasting effects of intense COTS predation on slow coral recovery.
2. While the model includes instantaneous predation impacts, it overlooks cumulative tissue damage — a feedback mechanism whereby heavy predation events impair coral regrowth over multiple time steps.
3. To address this, we introduce a cumulative damage state (slow_damage) that accumulates damage from predation events and decays over time. This indirect feedback reduces the effective growth rate of slow corals after outbreaks, thereby better capturing the observed boom‐bust cycles.
4. New parameters log_damage_decay and log_alpha_damage control the decay rate of accumulated damage and the fraction of predation contributing to lasting damage, respectively.
