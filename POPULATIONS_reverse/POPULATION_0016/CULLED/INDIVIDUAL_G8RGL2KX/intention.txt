Assessment and Improvement for COTS-Coral Model:
1. Evaluation: The current model, while capturing basic outbreak dynamics via logistic growth and Type III predation responses, underperforms on the residuals. This suggests that density dependence in coral dynamics is oversimplified.
2. Reasoning: In high coral cover scenarios, competition for space and resources leads to an inhibition of growth that intensifies nonlinearly. A higher‚Äêorder density dependence better reflects how resource limitations modulate coral recovery.
3. Improvement: We introduce a nonlinear competition term by replacing the simple logistic term 
   (1 - coral_pred(t-1) / K) 
with a higher-order term 
   (1 - pow(coral_pred(t-1) / K, 1 + comp)).
   Here, new parameters "log_comp_slow" and "log_comp_fast" modulate this effect for slow and fast corals respectively. When zero, the original logistic form is recovered; positive values enhance density-dependent inhibition.
