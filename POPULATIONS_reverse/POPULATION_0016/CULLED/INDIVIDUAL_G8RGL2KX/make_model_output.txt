Below is our proposed improvement. Based on the PROJECT CONTEXT and residuals analysis, we observed that the current logistic density‐dependence in coral dynamics may be too simplistic. In reality, coral populations often face      
nonlinear competition for space/resources, meaning that as coral cover increases, the inhibition of further growth intensifies more strongly than a simple linear logistic term. To capture this, we are introducing a higher‐order     
(“nonlinear”) density dependence for both slow and fast coral species. We add two new parameters (log_comp_slow and log_comp_fast) to represent increased competition effects. In our equations we replace the standard term

with a nonlinear one

This modification uses only previous timestep values and should help better capture the boom–bust dynamics by penalising explosive coral recovery under high density.

 Assessment and Improvement for COTS-Coral Model:                                                                                                                                                                                       
 1. Evaluation: The current model, while capturing basic outbreak dynamics with logistic growth and Type III predation responses, appears to underperform in explaining residuals, suggesting that density-dependence in coral dynamics 
 may be oversimplified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 2. Reasoning: In reality, as coral cover approaches carrying capacity, competition for space and resources can lead to a nonlinear inhibition of growth. Such increased resource limitation, particularly in densely populated reef    
 areas, can contribute to the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                                   
 3. Improvement: We introduce a higher-order density dependence by incorporating a nonlinear (higher-order) competition term into the coral growth equations. New parameters (log_comp_slow and log_comp_fast) are added to modulate th 
 effect. When set to zero, the model reverts to the original logistic form. Positive values imply stronger inhibition as coral cover increases.

 =======                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 Assessment and Improvement for COTS-Coral Model:                                                                                                                                                                                       
 1. Evaluation: The current model, while capturing basic outbreak dynamics via logistic growth and Type III predation responses, underperforms on the residuals. This suggests that density dependence in coral dynamics is             
 oversimplified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 2. Reasoning: In high coral cover scenarios, competition for space and resources leads to an inhibition of growth that intensifies nonlinearly. A higher‐order density dependence better reflects how resource limitations modulate    
 coral recovery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 3. Improvement: We introduce a nonlinear competition term by replacing the simple logistic term                                                                                                                                        
    (1 - coral_pred(t-1) / K)                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 with a higher-order term                                                                                                                                                                                                               
    (1 - pow(coral_pred(t-1) / K, 1 + comp)).                                                                                                                                                                                           
    Here, new parameters "log_comp_slow" and "log_comp_fast" modulate this effect for slow and fast corals respectively. When zero, the original logistic form is recovered; positive values enhance density-dependent inhibition.
