Below are the proposed changes. I will:                                            

 1 Update the intention.txt file with our ecological assessment and reasoning.     
 2 Add a new parameter in parameters.json to scale COTS larval immigration.        
 3 In model.cpp, add the new parameter in the parameters list and transformation   
   block.                                                                          
 4 Update Equation 1 to include the larval immigration term (using the previous    
   time step value for cotsimm_dat).

 The current model captures key mechanisms (logistic growth, temperature effects,  
 predation, and self‐limiting processes) and fits observed outbreak patterns       
 reasonably well; however, it neglects an important ecological process: larval     
 immigration. Although cotsimm_dat is provided as data, it is not used in the      
 population dynamics. Incorporating a larval immigration term introduces an extern 
 seeding mechanism which can help trigger outbreak events. This adjustment is      
 ecologically justified as larval influx can boost local COTS numbers, affecting t 
 timing and magnitude of outbreaks. The added parameter (log_immigration_COTS)     
 scales this effect appropriately.
