Project Assessment and Chosen Improvement:

The current model captures key mechanisms (logistic growth, temperature effects, predation, and self‚Äêlimiting processes) and fits observed outbreak patterns reasonably well; however, it neglects an important ecological process: larval immigration. Although cotsimm_dat is provided as data, it is not used in the population dynamics. Incorporating a larval immigration term introduces an external seeding mechanism which can trigger outbreak events. This adjustment is ecologically justified because larval influx can boost local COTS numbers, affecting the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
