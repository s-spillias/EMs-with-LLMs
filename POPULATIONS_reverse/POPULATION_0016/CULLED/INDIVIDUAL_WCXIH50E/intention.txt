Model Assessment:
The current model uses quadratic density-dependence (i.e. self_limiting_COTS * cots_pred^2) to regulate COTS outbreaks. However, the residuals indicate that the model underestimates the abrupt termination of outbreaks, suggesting that the quadratic form oversimplifies the strong intraspecific competition or resource limitation at high densities.
Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a new parameter, log_self_limiting_exp, to allow a flexible non-linear self-limiting feedback via a power function. This enhancement enables sharper declines in COTS numbers once a critical density is exceeded, aligning with observed boomâ€“bust dynamics in COTS populations.
