Assessment and Improvement:
The current model captures several key dynamics of COTS outbreaks including temperature effects, logistic growth of coral, type III predation responses, and an Allee effect in COTS reproduction. However, the fixed steepness (slope = 10) of the Allee effect's logistic function offers limited flexibility to represent varying mate-finding difficulties at low densities. Ecologically, reproduction may switch rapidly from suppressed to explosive once a critical density is reached, but the abruptness may differ across systems.

To address this, I have introduced a new parameter "log_allee_slope" that allows tuning of the logistic slope. This modification provides a more realistic representation of the mate-finding process and reproduction onset in COTS populations, potentially improving the timing, magnitude, and duration predictions of outbreak events in accordance with observed boom-bust dynamics.
