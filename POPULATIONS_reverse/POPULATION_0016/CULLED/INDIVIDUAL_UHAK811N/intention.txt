Assessment and Improvement:
After reviewing the current model and residuals, the dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) did not explicitly incorporate a density-dependent self-limiting mechanism. Ecologically, as COTS populations surge during outbreaks, competition for limited resources (or other density-dependent factors) should lead to a rapid decline, contributing to boom-bust cycles. 

To capture this effect, a new parameter (log_cots_comp) is introduced. In the revised COTS dynamics, an additional term—proportional to the square of the previous timestep's COTS density—has been added. This density-dependent competition term ensures that when COTS numbers become excessively high, self-regulation sets in, leading to declines that better reflect the observed outbreak dynamics.
