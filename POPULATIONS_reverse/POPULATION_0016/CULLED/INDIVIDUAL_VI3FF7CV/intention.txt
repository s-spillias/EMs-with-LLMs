Assessment:
- The current model reasonably captures the boom‑bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks but uses a fixed quadratic (exponent = 2) form for slow coral damage due to COTS predation. This inflexibility may limit the model’s ability to match observed variability in outbreak magnitudes.
Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce a new parameter "log_damage_exponent" to allow flexible non‑linear scaling of damage on slow coral by replacing the fixed exponent (2) with a variable exponent, i.e. exp(log_damage_exponent). This provides a tunable threshold response that can capture variable catastrophic coral loss during outbreaks.
- All model predictions continue to use only previous time‑step values to avoid data leakage.
