Assessment:
The current model captures key aspects of COTS outbreak dynamics but underestimates the rapid bust phase following high-density outbreaks.
We interpret this as an overly simplistic (quadratic) representation of the self‐limiting density feedback in COTS reproduction.
To reflect ecological processes such as resource depletion and intensified intraspecific interference at high densities,
we introduce a higher-order self-limiting term by adding a new parameter ("log_self_limiting_exponent").
This adjustment allows the self-limiting effect to be more nonlinear (exponent > 2 if needed), thereby better capturing the abrupt declines after outbreaks.
