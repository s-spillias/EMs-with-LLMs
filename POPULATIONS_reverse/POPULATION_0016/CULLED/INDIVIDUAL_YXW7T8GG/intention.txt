I have assessed the current model and found that while it captures the general boom‐bust dynamics of COTS populations, the reproduction term appears slightly oversimplified. In particular, although an Allee effect is included, the model does not account for an amplification mechanism that can trigger the explosive growth characteristic of outbreak events.

To address this, I have introduced a new parameter "log_ramp_factor" to create a non‐linear positive feedback in reproduction. When the previous COTS density exceeds the Allee threshold, reproduction is further amplified proportionally. This enhancement better captures ecological processes such as synergistic reproduction or aggregation effects, leading to more accurate predictions of the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak cycles. Note that only previous time-step values are used throughout.
