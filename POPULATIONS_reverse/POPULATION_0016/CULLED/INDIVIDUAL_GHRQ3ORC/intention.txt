Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation by incorporating logistic coral growth and Type III functional responses. However, the residual analysis revealed that the response of COTS reproduction to available coral cover is too gradual. Ecologically, once a threshold of coral cover is reached, outbreaks tend to initiate rapidly.

Ecological Improvement:
We have introduced a non-linear Hill exponent into the coral_modifier for COTS reproduction. By raising coral cover and the half-saturation constant to the power of an exponent (hill_exponent > 1), the model now exhibits a sharper, threshold-like response. This adjustment better captures the rapid increase in reproduction rates once sufficient coral cover is present, leading to the characteristic boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks. The new parameter, log_hill_exponent, allows for calibration of this non-linear response based on observed data.

Rationale:
This change is ecologically justified as it provides a mechanism to represent the rapid transition in outbreak dynamics, ensuring that the model more accurately captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions.
