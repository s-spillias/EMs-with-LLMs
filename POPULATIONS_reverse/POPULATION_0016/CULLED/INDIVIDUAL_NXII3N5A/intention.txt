Assessment of Current Model:
- The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS and incorporates temperature and coral cover effects.
- However, the fixed quadratic form for coral predation (using slow_pred^2 and fast_pred^2) may oversimplify how predation efficiency responds to coral density.

Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce a flexible, non-linear predation response by adding a new parameter (log_pred_exponent). The revised predation terms become:
  predation = (cots_pred(t-1) * pow(coral_pred(t-1), pred_exponent)) / (pow(half_sat, pred_exponent) + pow(coral_pred(t-1), pred_exponent) + 1e-8)
- This allows the sensitivity of predation to coral cover to be adjusted, capturing threshold effects where predation efficiency is low at minimal coral cover and rapidly increases beyond a threshold.

Ecological Rationale:
- The non-linear, adjustable response better reflects ecological reality where factors like coral detectability and foraging efficiency vary with coral density, thereby improving the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy for outbreak events.
