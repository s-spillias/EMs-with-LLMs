Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Model Assessment:
   - The current model adequately captures the boom‐bust cycles of COTS via reproduction, mortality, and predation terms.
   - However, residual analysis indicates that the recovery phase for corals is over‐predicted when coral cover is very low.
2. Ecological Reasoning:
   - In real reef systems, when coral cover is extremely diminished, recruitment and recovery are often suppressed due to Allee effects and limited larval settlement.
   - A recruitment limitation mechanism can more realistically delay coral recovery until a critical density is reached.
3. Chosen Improvement:
   - We add a new parameter "log_rec" representing a recruitment constant.
   - The logistic growth term for both coral types is multiplied by a factor (current coral cover/(current coral cover + rec)).
   - This modification reduces the effective growth rate when coral cover is low, better capturing the ecological dynamics.
