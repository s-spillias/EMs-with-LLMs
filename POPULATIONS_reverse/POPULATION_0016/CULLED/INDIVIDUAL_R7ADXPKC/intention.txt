[Assessment]
After evaluating the current model in the context of modeling episodic COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef, we find that the basic dynamics are captured. However, the mate‐finding mechanism (Allee effect) for COTS reproduction is oversimplified, with a fixed sigmoidal function that does not allow for the rapid reproduction acceleration observed once densities surpass a critical threshold.
To address this, we introduce a higher‐order (quadratic) modifier to the Allee effect. This modification amplifies reproduction non‐linearly when COTS density exceeds the threshold, thereby capturing the explosive boom‐and‐bust dynamics observed in outbreaks.
A new parameter, log_allee_poly, is added to govern the strength of this amplification.
