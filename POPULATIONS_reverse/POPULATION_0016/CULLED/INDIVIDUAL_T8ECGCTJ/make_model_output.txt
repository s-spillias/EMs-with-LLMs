Below are the proposed changes and our rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                       

Assessment and chosen improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                      
Based on the residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) and the project context, it appears that the current model sometimes overestimates COTS numbers during the outbreak‐decline phase. Ecologically, when coral  
(the food resource) is heavily depleted by intense predation, COTS should suffer increased density‐dependent mortality because of limited food availability. To capture this feedback, we add a food limitation mechanism into the COTS 
dynamics. This is implemented by modulating the self‐limiting mortality term using the relative coral abundance (aggregated as the sum of slow and fast coral) compared to the total coral capacity (K_slow + K_fast). A new parameter  
(log_food_lim) is introduced to control the strength of this feedback. When coral cover is low, the multiplier increases and drives up COTS mortality, which is ecologically justified as unsustainable outbreak events should collapse 
when food becomes scarce.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 Residual analysis indicates that the model tends to overpredict COTS numbers during outbreak declines. This suggests that the current density‐dependent (self‐limiting) term is not fully capturing the ecological feedback of food    
 limitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 To address this, I have introduced a food limitation mechanism into the COTS dynamics. When coral (the food resource) declines, the model now increases the density-dependent mortality of COTS. Ecologically, this adjustment reflect 
 that severe coral depletion leads to starvation in COTS, thereby naturally damping outbreak peaks.

Once these changes are applied, you can re-run your model to evaluate if the addition of the food limitation feedback improves the model fit to the observed outbreak dynamics.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 Residual analysis indicates that the model tends to overpredict COTS numbers during outbreak declines. This suggests that the current density‐dependent (self‐limiting) term is not fully capturing the ecological feedback of food    
 limitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 To address this, I have introduced a food limitation mechanism into the COTS dynamics. When coral (the food resource) declines, the model now increases the density-dependent mortality of COTS. Ecologically, this adjustment reflect 
 that severe coral depletion leads to starvation in COTS, thereby naturally damping outbreak peaks.
