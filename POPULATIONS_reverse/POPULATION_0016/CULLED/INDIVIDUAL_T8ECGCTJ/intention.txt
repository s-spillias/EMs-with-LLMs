Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
Residual analysis indicates that the model tends to overpredict COTS numbers during outbreak declines. This suggests that the current density‐dependent (self‐limiting) term is not fully capturing the ecological feedback of food limitation.
To address this, I have introduced a food limitation mechanism into the COTS dynamics. When coral (the food resource) declines, the model now increases the density-dependent mortality of COTS. Ecologically, this adjustment reflects that severe coral depletion leads to starvation in COTS, thereby naturally damping outbreak peaks.
