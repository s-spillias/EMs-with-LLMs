Assessment and Improvements:
1. The current model captures the basic outbreak and recovery dynamics; however, residuals indicate systematic misfits during outbreak peaks.
2. An oversimplified aspect is the fixed half-saturation constant for coral predation. Ecologically, coral vulnerability increases under thermal stress.
3. We introduce a new parameter (log_half_sat_temp) that adjusts the half-saturation constant based on the previous sea-surface temperature deviation from the optimal temperature (opt_temp_coral). This allows for higher predation efficiency when temperatures are unfavourable for coral health.
4. This modification adds environmental feedback on coral vulnerability and better captures the observed boom-bust cycles in COTS outbreaks.
