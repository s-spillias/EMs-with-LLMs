Below are the proposed changes. First, we will update the intention file with our assessment and justification, then add a new parameter (log_stress_slow) to parameters.json, and finally modify model.cpp to use the new parameter in 
the slow coral dynamics. Please review the full file paths below and confirm their inclusion in the chat.

 The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their impacts on coral communities using delayed feedback mechanisms (e.g., logistic growth in corals and density-dependent regulation in COTS). However, one  
 key ecological process that may be oversimplified is the effect of environmental stress on coral vulnerability. In nature, when slow-growing corals (such as Faviidae and Porites) are exposed to high temperatures, their defenses    
 weaken, making them more susceptible to predation by COTS.                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 We have introduced a new parameter, log_stress_slow, which scales the predation pressure on slow corals when sea-surface temperatures exceed their optimum (opt_temp_coral). This environmental stress factor increases predation loss 
 during stressful periods, thereby improving the model’s ability to capture the magnitude and duration of outbreak events. Importantly, the model still avoids data leakage by using only past time-step values for predictions.

Once you have applied these changes, the model now includes an environmental stress modifier that increases slow coral vulnerability to COTS predation when sea-surface temperatures exceed the optimum. This improvement should produce
more realistic predictions of outbreak dynamics under environmental stress.

 The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their impacts on coral communities using delayed feedback mechanisms (e.g., logistic growth in corals and density-dependent regulation in COTS). However, one  
 key ecological process that may be oversimplified is the effect of environmental stress on coral vulnerability. In nature, when slow-growing corals (such as Faviidae and Porites) are exposed to high temperatures, their defenses    
 weaken, making them more susceptible to predation by COTS.                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 We have introduced a new parameter, log_stress_slow, which scales the predation pressure on slow corals when sea-surface temperatures exceed their optimum (opt_temp_coral). This environmental stress factor increases predation loss 
 during stressful periods, thereby improving the model’s ability to capture the magnitude and duration of outbreak events. Importantly, the model still avoids data leakage by using only past time‐step values for predictions.
