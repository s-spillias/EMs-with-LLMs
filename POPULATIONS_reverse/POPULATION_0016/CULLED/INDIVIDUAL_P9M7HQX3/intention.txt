Assessment:
The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their impacts on coral communities using delayed feedback mechanisms (e.g., logistic growth in corals and density-dependent regulation in COTS). However, one key ecological process that may be oversimplified is the effect of environmental stress on coral vulnerability. In nature, when slow-growing corals (such as Faviidae and Porites) are exposed to high temperatures, their defenses weaken, making them more susceptible to predation by COTS.

Improvement:
We have introduced a new parameter, log_stress_slow, which scales the predation pressure on slow corals when sea-surface temperatures exceed their optimum (opt_temp_coral). This environmental stress factor increases predation losses during stressful periods, thereby improving the model’s ability to capture the magnitude and duration of outbreak events. Importantly, the model still avoids data leakage by using only past time‐step values for predictions.
