Below are the proposed changes. I suggest we:                                      

 1 Update intention.txt with a discussion of the current model’s performance and   
   our proposed improvement. We note that while the model captures outbreak‐cycles 
   and selective coral predation, the fixed quadratic form used for the coral      
   modifier (i.e. the effect of total coral cover on COTS reproduction) may be too 
   inflexible. Ecologically, when coral is abundant the reproductive benefits to   
   COTS could be disproportionately large. To allow for a tunable, higher‐order    
   (non‐linear) response, we add a new parameter (log_coral_mod_exp) that governs  
   the exponent applied to both the available coral and the half‑saturation        
   constant in the coral modifier. This change makes the sensitivity of COTS       
   reproduction to coral cover adjustable, improving the model’s ability to match  
   the observed outbreak dynamics.                                                 
 2 In parameters.json, add the new parameter object for log_coral_mod_exp (with    
   full ecological justification).                                                 
 3 In model.cpp:                                                                   
    • Insert a new parameter declaration for log_coral_mod_exp.                    
    • Transform it to a new variable coral_mod_exp.                                
    • Update the calculation of the coral modifier so that it uses coral_mod_exp   
      instead of a fixed exponent of 2.

 =======                                                                           
 Assessment:                                                                       
 The current model effectively captures the observed boom-bust cycles and selectiv 
 predation dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) on coral communities.       
 However, the model oversimplifies the impact of coral availability on COTS        
 reproduction by using a fixed quadratic (power of 2) response in the coral        
 modifier. Ecologically, when coral cover is high, small increases in available    
 coral may result in disproportionately high reproductive benefits for COTS. To    
 address this, I propose introducing a tunable non‐linear exponent by adding a new 
 parameter, log_coral_mod_exp. This parameter allows the exponent applied to both  
 available coral and the half‑saturation constant to be data‐driven, improving the 
 model’s sensitivity to resource availability and better capturing outbreak        
 triggers.

 Assessment and Model Improvement:

 predictions; the model underestimates the duration and magnitude of COTS outbreak 
 2. Project Context: While the model captures the basic boom‐bust dynamics of COTS 
 and their coral predation, it fails to incorporate the lingering effects of       
 prolonged high sea‐surface temperatures, which are known to prime COTS for        
 sustained outbreaks.                                                              
 3. Chosen Improvement: Introduce an environmental memory (stress) effect. By addi 
 a new time constant (tau_env) that governs how positive temperature anomalies     
 accumulate and persist, we modify the COTS reproduction term to account for the   
 cumulative impact of prolonged heat stress.                                       
 =======                                                                           
 Assessment:                                                                       
 The current model effectively captures the observed boom-bust cycles and selectiv 
 predation dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) on coral communities.       
 However, it oversimplifies the effect of coral availability on COTS reproduction  
 using a fixed quadratic (power of 2) response in the coral modifier. Ecologically 
 when coral cover is high, small increases in available coral may have             
 disproportionately large effects on reproduction.                                 
                                                                                   
 Chosen Improvement:                                                               
 Introduce a tunable non‐linear exponent in the coral modifier. By adding a new    
 parameter (log_coral_mod_exp), the exponent applied to both the available coral a 
 the half‑saturation constant becomes adjustable. This permits the model to captur 
 higher‐order sensitivity to coral resources, thereby better representing outbreak 
 triggers.
