Assessment and Reasoning:
The residuals indicated that the current logistic growth formulation for coral (both slow and fast groups) may be oversimplifying the effects of density-dependent competition, which can influence coral recovery during and after COTS outbreaks. To better capture the boom–bust dynamics of outbreaks, we introduce a nonlinear density‐dependent competition term in the logistic growth process.
By adding the parameter "log_coral_comp" (with exp transformation to obtain coral_comp), we modulate the logistic term as:
    pow(1 - (coral_pred_previous / K), coral_comp)
This formulation allows for increased competition intensity as coral densities approach the carrying capacity (or remain very low), thereby providing flexibility to capture altered recovery dynamics under ecological stress.
This ecological improvement creates a more dynamic response in coral recovery that interacts with COTS predation, closely aligning with the project context.
