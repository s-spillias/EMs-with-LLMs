Assessment:
The current model captures many critical dynamics of COTS outbreaks (temperature-dependent reproduction, logistic coral growth, and type III predation responses). However, the rapid bust phase following outbreak peaks is underrepresented due to an insufficient density-dependent self-limiting mechanism. To better capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles, we propose introducing an additional cubic density-dependent mortality term for COTS, denoted as extra_limiting_COTS. This term represents intense crowding effects during outbreak conditions and drives rapid population declines.
Changes made:
- Added the parameter "log_extra_limiting_COTS" in parameters.json.
- Updated the COTS dynamics in model.cpp to include an extra mortality term: - extra_limiting_COTS * pow(cots_pred(t-1), 3).
All predictions use only previous time-step values to avoid data leakage.
