Assessment and Improvement Plan:
1. The current model captures boom-bust dynamics of COTS using non-linear responses in reproduction.
2. However, the coral predation dynamics are modeled with a fixed quadratic form, which may oversimplify threshold (refuge) effects.
3. To better reflect ecological realities, we are introducing a new parameter, "log_pred_hill," to allow a flexible non-linear response in coral vulnerability to predation.
4. With this change, the predation term will produce low predation at low coral covers and a rapid increase at higher covers, better matching observed outbreak events.
