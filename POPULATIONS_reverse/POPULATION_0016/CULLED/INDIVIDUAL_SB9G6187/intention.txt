Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model uses logistic growth for slow coral recovery, which does not capture an Allee effectâ€”a key ecological process that limits recruitment when coral cover is very low. Such an effect can be important in accurately predicting the timing and duration of COTS outbreaks by reflecting reduced recovery efficiency when coral populations are sparse. We therefore introduce an Allee effect multiplier in the slow coral growth term. A new parameter "log_coral_allee" (with coral_allee = exp(log_coral_allee)) is added to represent the threshold below which recruitment is significantly limited. This change aligns with our project context by incorporating a feedback mechanism that captures the constraints on reef resilience.
