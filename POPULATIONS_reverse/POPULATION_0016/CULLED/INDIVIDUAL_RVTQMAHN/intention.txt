Assessment and Improvement:
----------------------------
Residuals analysis indicates that after large COTS outbreaks the model systematically overestimates coral recovery. This suggests that long-term degradation effects on corals—resulting from sustained predation during outbreaks—are not fully captured.

Improvement:
------------
We add a delayed density-dependent degradation term to both slow and fast coral dynamics. This term subtracts a quantity proportional to the previous COTS density and the coral cover, reflecting lasting habitat damage. This enhancement better captures the boom-bust cycles observed on the Great Barrier Reef.
