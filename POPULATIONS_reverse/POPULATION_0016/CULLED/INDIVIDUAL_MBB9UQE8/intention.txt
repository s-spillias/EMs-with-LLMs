Assessment:
The current model fits the observed boom‚Äêbust dynamics moderately well but underestimates the intensity of interspecific competition between coral groups. Specifically, the linear competition terms in the logistic growth equations for slow and fast coral likely oversimplify the ecological interactions at high densities. 

Improvement:
We introduce additional quadratic competition terms that intensify the inhibitory effect of one coral group on the other when densities are high. This is implemented by adding new parameters (log_alpha_inter2 and log_beta_inter2) that modulate the squared contribution of the competitor's density. This extra nonlinearity better captures the strong interspecific competition, which is critical for accurately predicting the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
