Assessment & Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Our analysis shows that while the current model reproduces the boom‐bust cycles of COTS and associated coral dynamics reasonably, the interspecific coral competition is oversimplified. At high coral densities the inhibition that one
coral group exerts on the other is likely nonlinear. To address this, we introduce quadratic (density‑dependent) competition terms in the logistic growth functions for both slow and fast coral. This improvement is ecologically      
justified because it allows for stronger competitive inhibition when coral cover is very high, potentially shifting the balance in the ecosystem and affecting the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreak events.                        

To implement this:

 2 We add two new parameters (log_alpha_inter2 and log_beta_inter2) to parameters.json with clear ecological justification.                                                                                                             
 3 In model.cpp we add the new parameter definitions and modify the coral logistic growth terms to include quadratic competition (using the squared term of the competing coral).

 The current model fits the observed boom‐bust dynamics moderately well but underestimates the intensity of interspecific competition between coral groups. Specifically, the linear competition terms in the logistic growth equations 
 for slow and fast coral likely oversimplify the ecological interactions at high densities.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 We introduce additional quadratic competition terms that intensify the inhibitory effect of one coral group on the other when densities are high. This is implemented by adding new parameters (log_alpha_inter2 and log_beta_inter2)  
 which modulate the squared contribution of the competitor's density. This added nonlinearity better captures the strong interspecific competition that can contribute to the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks by      
 indirectly affecting coral resilience.

 The current model fits the observed boom‐bust dynamics moderately well but underestimates the intensity of interspecific competition between coral groups. Specifically, the linear competition terms in the logistic growth equations 
 for slow and fast coral likely oversimplify the ecological interactions at high densities.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 We introduce additional quadratic competition terms that intensify the inhibitory effect of one coral group on the other when densities are high. This is implemented by adding new parameters (log_alpha_inter2 and log_beta_inter2)  
 that modulate the squared contribution of the competitor's density. This extra nonlinearity better captures the strong interspecific competition, which is critical for accurately predicting the timing, magnitude, and duration of   
 COTS outbreaks.
