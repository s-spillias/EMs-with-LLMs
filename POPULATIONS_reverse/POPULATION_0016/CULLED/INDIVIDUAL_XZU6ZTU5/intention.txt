Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model reasonably captures boom-bust cycles via logistic growth and temperature-driven reproduction, yet it omits an important ecological driverâ€”external larval immigration.
Observations indicate that larval immigration can seed COTS populations from external sources, potentially triggering outbreak events.
As an ecological improvement, we add a new parameter "log_immigration" which scales the observed larval immigration rate (cotsimm_dat) from the previous time step.
This modification introduces a resource pulse that reflects episodic immigration, improving the model's capacity to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events without violating the no data leakage rule.
