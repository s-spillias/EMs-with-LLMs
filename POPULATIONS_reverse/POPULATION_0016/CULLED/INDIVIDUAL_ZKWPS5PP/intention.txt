Assessment and Improvement:
The current model captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS and their interactions with coral communities. However, residual analysis indicates that slow coral recovery is overestimated following peak COTS outbreaks. This suggests that cumulative tissue damage from intense predation is not adequately captured.
To address this, we introduce a delayed damage feedback in slow coral dynamics. The new parameter, log_damage_slow, scales the damage incurred on slow corals as a function of the previous COTS density relative to the coral carrying capacity. This improvement is ecologically justifiedâ€”intense and repeated predation can cause sustained damage, reducing coral recovery rates even under favorable growth conditions.
