Assessment and Improvement for COTS Outbreak Modeling:

Based on our analysis and residuals review, the current model underestimates the rapid increase 
in Crown of Thorns starfish numbers once sea-surface temperatures (SST) exceed the optimal value 
(opt_temp_COTS). This suggests that the non-linear temperature dependence in the reproduction 
process is too smooth to capture the abrupt outbreak trigger observed in the data.

To improve this, we introduce an additional temperature-driven outbreak boost parameter 
(log_temp_outbreak). When SST exceeds opt_temp_COTS, the reproduction term is multiplied by an 
exponential term that sharply increases reproduction rate. This non-linear enhancement better 
captures the boom phase of COTS outbreaks, while still using only previous time-step SST values 
to avoid data leakage.

This change makes the ecological process more realistic by representing an abrupt boost in reproduction 
under extreme thermal conditions.
