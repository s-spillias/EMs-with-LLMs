The model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
It captures the boom-bust cycles observed during outbreak events, where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels and then decline.
The model explicitly accounts for:
1. COTS reproduction driven by a saturating function of total coral cover (combining slow-growing Faviidae/Porites and fast-growing Acropora species) and modulated by an environmental efficiency parameter.
2. Selective predation impacts where COTS preferentially reduce coral cover.
3. Indirect feedback loops between COTS dynamics and coral health.
4. Numerical strategies that ensure stability via small constants and smooth approximations.
Importantly, the model uses only lagged (previous time step) values in prediction calculations to prevent data leakage.
