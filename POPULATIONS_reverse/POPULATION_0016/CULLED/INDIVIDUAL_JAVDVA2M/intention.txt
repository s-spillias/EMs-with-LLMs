# Assessment and Improvement for COTS Model
The current model captures basic boom-bust dynamics but uses a linear function to model the effect of sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Ecologically, outbreak events are often triggered when SST anomalies exceed a critical threshold, triggering rapid increases in reproduction. To capture this behavior more accurately, a non-linear, sigmoidal response function is introduced. A new parameter "log_sst_threshold" is added to represent the SST threshold (after exponentiation) at which enhanced COTS reproduction is triggered. This mechanism better reflects the ecological reality of abrupt outbreak onsets while retaining the use of past time-step data to avoid leakage.
