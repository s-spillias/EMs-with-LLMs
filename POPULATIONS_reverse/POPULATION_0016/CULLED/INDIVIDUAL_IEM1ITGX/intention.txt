Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model adequately captures many aspects of COTS outbreak dynamics, including logistic growth of corals and non‐linear predation responses. However, while cumulative damage effects from sustained predation are applied to slow-growing corals, fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.) also likely experience tissue damage during prolonged COTS outbreaks. This additional damage can impair recovery and prolong the outbreak period.
Improvement:
Introduce a new parameter (log_damage_fast) and include a corresponding damage term in the fast coral dynamics. This adjustment reflects an indirect feedback mechanism in which repeated COTS predation damages fast-growing corals, aligning the model more closely with observed boom‐bust cycles.
