Assessment:
The current model captures the basic dynamics of COTS and coral populations using logistic growth and saturating predation functions, along with non-linear temperature effects. However, abrupt outbreak triggers related to thermal anomalies appear underrepresented. Residuals indicate that the current quadratic response to sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies does not sufficiently capture rapid transitions in COTS reproduction.
Improvement:
We introduce a logistic threshold function as part of the SST multiplier to better capture outbreak triggers. Two new parameters are added:
  - log_sst_threshold: the SST anomaly threshold (relative to a 26Â°C baseline) above which reproduction is enhanced.
  - log_sst_threshold_k: the steepness of the logistic response.
This modification is ecologically justified since many marine species display threshold responses to thermal stress, triggering rapid population shifts.
