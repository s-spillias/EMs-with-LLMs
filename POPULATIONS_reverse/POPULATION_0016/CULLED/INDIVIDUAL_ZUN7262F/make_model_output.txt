   – I’ve added an explanation, assessing that while the current model reproduces COTS outbreaks reasonably well, residuals indicate that coral recovery dynamics are oversimplified. In ecological systems, coral recruitment tends to 
   slow dramatically when coral cover is too low (an Allee effect) which delays recovery after heavy predation. This improvement explicitly captures an Allee effect on coral recovery.

   – I’ve added a new parameter log_allee_coral with detailed ecological justification.

   – I’ve updated the parameter declarations and transformations to include log_allee_coral (transformed to allee_coral). – I’ve modified both the slow and fast coral dynamics (“Equation 2” and “Equation 3”) so that the logistic    
   growth term is now modulated by an Allee effect multiplier based on the total coral cover (calculated from the previous time step). This ensures that if the combined coral cover is below a threshold (given by                     
   exp(log_allee_coral)), the coral’s recovery is suppressed.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 The current model captures the rapid outbreak and subsequent decline of COTS and includes key processes such as temperature effects, logistic coral growth, and even an Allee effect on COTS reproduction. However, the residuals      
 indicate that the recovery of coral communities is not fully captured. In reality, coral recruitment is highly sensitive to very low coral cover – when coral numbers drop too low, recruitment is unreliable due to limited larval    
 supply and mate-finding difficulties (a classic Allee effect).                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 To address this, I have introduced an Allee effect for coral recovery. A new parameter, log_allee_coral, sets a threshold below which coral growth is significantly reduced. This modification is ecologically justified as it         
 represents the delayed recovery seen in degraded coral systems following severe predation, improving the model's ability to predict the timing and duration of outbreak events.

 The current model captures the rapid outbreak and subsequent decline of COTS and includes key processes such as temperature effects, logistic coral growth, and even an Allee effect on COTS reproduction. However, the residuals      
 indicate that the recovery of coral communities is not fully captured. In reality, coral recruitment is highly sensitive to very low coral cover – when coral numbers drop too low, recruitment is unreliable due to limited larval    
 supply and mate-finding difficulties (a classic Allee effect).                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 To address this, I have introduced an Allee effect for coral recovery. A new parameter, log_allee_coral, sets a threshold below which coral growth is significantly reduced. This modification is ecologically justified as it         
 represents the delayed recovery seen in degraded coral systems following severe predation, improving the model's ability to predict the timing and duration of outbreak events.
