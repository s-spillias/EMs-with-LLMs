Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model captures the rapid outbreak and subsequent decline of COTS and includes key processes such as temperature effects, logistic coral growth, and even an Allee effect on COTS reproduction. However, the residuals indicate that the recovery of coral communities is not fully captured. In reality, coral recruitment is highly sensitive to very low coral cover â€“ when coral numbers drop too low, recruitment is unreliable due to limited larval supply and mate-finding difficulties (a classic Allee effect).

To address this, I have introduced an Allee effect for coral recovery. A new parameter, log_allee_coral, sets a threshold below which coral growth is significantly reduced. This modification is ecologically justified as it represents the delayed recovery seen in degraded coral systems following severe predation, improving the model's ability to predict the timing and duration of outbreak events.
