Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS well and incorporates cumulative damage for slow coral. However, fast-growing corals were not modeled with a similar damage accumulation mechanism. Given that intense COTS predation can also impair fast coral recovery (albeit to a lesser extent), we introduce a new damage term for fast coral. This change enhances the ecological realism by accounting for cumulative predation impacts on fast coral, thereby improving the modelâ€™s ability to predict outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
