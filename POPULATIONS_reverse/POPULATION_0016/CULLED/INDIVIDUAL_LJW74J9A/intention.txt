Assessment:

The current model fits the boom‚Äêbust cycles of COTS moderately well but does not fully capture the saturating effects of predation on coral. In particular, it uses a fixed non-linear exponent for predation (via log_pred_exp) that does not account for resource limitations when coral densities are high. 

The chosen improvement is to introduce variable efficiency by adding a new parameter, log_eff_modifier, that modulates the coral predation term. This parameter reflects ecological resource limitation whereby, as coral density increases, the additional increase in predation efficiency is dampened. This change is ecologically justified and aims to better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks while ensuring that only previous time-step values are used to avoid any data leakage.
