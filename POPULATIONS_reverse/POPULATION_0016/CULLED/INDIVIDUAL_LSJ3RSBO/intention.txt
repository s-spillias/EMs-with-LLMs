This update assesses the current model and its ability to capture the abrupt collapse of slow coral cover during COTS outbreak events. Residuals indicate that the existing formulation underestimates coral decline when coral cover is already low. 

To address this, we introduce a non‐linear escalation in the damage term for slow coral. Specifically, a new parameter, log_damage_threshold, is added so that when slow coral cover falls below exp(log_damage_threshold), the impact of COTS predation is amplified via an exponential multiplier. 

This addition is ecologically justified because low coral abundance can compromise recovery and trigger rapid collapse, capturing boom‐bust dynamics more accurately.
