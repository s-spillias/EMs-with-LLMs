Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model uses a fixed Gaussian response for the temperature effect on COTS reproduction, which may be oversimplified given the complex dynamics underlying outbreak events. Observed residuals suggest that outbreak triggers could benefit from a more flexible non-linear response. By introducing a new parameter (log_cots_temp_poly) to allow a polynomial scaling of the temperature deviation term, the model can better adjust the curvature of this response, hence improving the accuracy in predicting the timing, magnitude, and duration of the COTS outbreaks. This change is ecologically justified as it accommodates the notion that even small deviations from the optimal temperature might non-linearly exacerbate reproduction rates, thereby better capturing the boom-bust cycle observed in nature.
