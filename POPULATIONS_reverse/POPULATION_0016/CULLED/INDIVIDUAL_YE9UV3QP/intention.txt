Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

1. The current model fits observed boom-bust cycles reasonably well using logistic growth and saturating coral predation. However, its linear response to sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies in COTS reproduction may oversimplify the ecological process.
2. In natural systems, starfish reproduction can be strongly non-linear with respect to temperature, displaying a threshold effect where reproduction intensifies sharply when SST nears an optimal value.
3. To capture this, we now incorporate a Gaussian (non-linear) temperature response for COTS reproduction. This approach introduces two new parameters:
   - log_cots_temp_sensitivity: Governs how sharply reproduction responds to deviations from the optimal temperature.
   - opt_temp_COTS: Represents the optimal SST for triggering COTS reproductive outbreaks.
4. These changes improve the modelâ€™s ability to depict the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events while rigorously avoiding data leakage by only using previous time-step values.
