Assessment and Model Improvement:
The current model generally captures the characteristic outbreak dynamics of COTS via temperature and coral cover modifiers. However, inspection of residuals indicates that peak outbreak levels are being underestimated. This suggests that high COTS densities may trigger density‐dependent regulation that is not currently modeled.
To address this, we introduce a density‐dependent competition mechanism into the reproduction term. By adding a new parameter (log_comp) and modifying reproduction to include an exponential decay (exp(- comp * previous COTS density)), we simulate intraspecific competition for resources. This adjustment is ecologically justified as it helps capture the boom‐bust cycle observed in outbreak events.
