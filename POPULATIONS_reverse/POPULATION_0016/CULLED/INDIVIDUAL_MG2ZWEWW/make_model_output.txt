The current model employs a linear saturating function for coral availability in COTS reproduction. Although it captures resource limitation to some extent, residual analysis indicates that the model tends to smooth over the        
outbreak threshold. Ecologically, COTS outbreaks are triggered when coral cover crosses a critical threshold, resulting in a rapid increase in reproduction. To better capture this non‐linear response, we propose replacing the linear
coral modifier with a higher‐order (non-linear) form using an exponent. We introduce a new parameter, log_coral_modifier_shape, which will adjust the steepness of the coral availability effect on COTS reproduction. An exponent of 1 
recovers the current formulation, while values >1 yield a sharper threshold effect. This change improves the representation of the abrupt outbreak transitions while still using only previous time step values, so data leakage is     
avoided.

 The current model includes a saturating function for coral availability in the COTS reproduction term. However, the linear form (coral_total / (half_sat + coral_total)) oversimplifies the ecological process. Residuals indicate tha 
 the model is not fully capturing the rapid threshold‐triggered outbreak events, where small increases in available coral lead to steep increases in reproduction.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 We introduce a higher-order, non-linear transformation of coral availability by adding a new parameter, log_coral_modifier_shape. With this parameter, the coral modifier becomes:                                                     
     coral_modifier = [coral_total^shape] / ([half_sat^shape] + [coral_total^shape] + small_constant)                                                                                                                                   
 An exponent value >1 will capture a sharper transition in reproduction as coral cover increases, thus better simulating the rapid escalation of COTS outbreaks observed ecologically. This additional complexity is justified by       
 improved realism in representing the threshold dynamics driving boom-bust cycles.

 The current model includes a saturating function for coral availability in the COTS reproduction term. However, the linear form (coral_total / (half_sat + coral_total)) oversimplifies the ecological process. Residuals indicate tha 
 the model is not fully capturing the rapid threshold‐triggered outbreak events, where small increases in available coral lead to steep increases in reproduction.

 We introduce a higher-order, non-linear transformation of coral availability by adding a new parameter, log_coral_modifier_shape. With this parameter, the coral modifier becomes:                                                     
     coral_modifier = [coral_total^shape] / ([half_sat^shape] + [coral_total^shape] + small_constant)                                                                                                                                   
 An exponent value >1 will capture a sharper transition in reproduction as coral cover increases, thus better simulating the rapid escalation of COTS outbreaks observed ecologically. This additional complexity is justified by       
 improved realism in representing the threshold dynamics driving boom-bust cycles.
