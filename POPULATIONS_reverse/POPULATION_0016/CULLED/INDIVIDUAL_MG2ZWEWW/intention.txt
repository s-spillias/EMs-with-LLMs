Assessment:
The current model includes a saturating function for coral availability in the COTS reproduction term. However, the linear form (coral_total / (half_sat + coral_total)) oversimplifies the ecological process. Residuals indicate that the model is not fully capturing the rapid threshold‐triggered outbreak events, where small increases in available coral lead to steep increases in reproduction.

Chosen Improvement:
We introduce a higher-order, non-linear transformation of coral availability by adding a new parameter, log_coral_modifier_shape. With this parameter, the coral modifier becomes:
    coral_modifier = [coral_total^shape] / ([half_sat^shape] + [coral_total^shape] + small_constant)
An exponent value >1 will capture a sharper transition in reproduction as coral cover increases, thus better simulating the rapid escalation of COTS outbreaks observed ecologically. This additional complexity is justified by improved realism in representing the threshold dynamics driving boom-bust cycles.
