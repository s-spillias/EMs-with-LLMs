Assessment:
The residual analysis suggests that the model generally captures COTS outbreak dynamics but that the current linear saturating function for coral availability does not fully reflect the threshold effects observed in practice. In environments with low coral cover, COTS reproduction is likely sharply limited, whereas higher coral cover rapidly enables outbreak conditions. To address this, the coral modifier was changed from a linear form to a quadratic form. This introduces a higher-order nonlinearity that enhances model sensitivity to coral cover, better replicating the rapid transitions seen in the Great Barrier Reef. All predictions use past time‚Äêstep values to avoid data leakage.
