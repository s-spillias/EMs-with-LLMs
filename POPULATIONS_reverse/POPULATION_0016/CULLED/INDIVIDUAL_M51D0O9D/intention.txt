PROJECT CONTEXT Assessment:
1. The current model effectively captures temperature modulation, Allee effects, and density-dependent self-limitation in COTS dynamics.
2. However, coral dynamics are oversimplified by ignoring interspecific competition between slow-growing and fast-growing corals.
3. The chosen improvement is to incorporate a cross-species competition term into both coral growth equations. This new term models resource limitation due to competition for space and nutrients, indirectly influencing COTS predation dynamics.
4. Ecologically, introducing interspecific competition is justified as it captures critical feedback loops that affect the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreak cycles.
