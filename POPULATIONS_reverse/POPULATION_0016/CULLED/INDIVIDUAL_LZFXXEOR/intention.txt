Assessment:
1. The current model captures key dynamics for COTS outbreaks and coral interactions but models non-linear damage only for slow coral.
2. Residual analysis suggests that fast-growing coral (Acropora spp.) losses are underestimated during outbreak events.
3. To better capture the boom-bust dynamics, we introduce a new damage feedback mechanism for fast coral.
4. The new parameter log_damage_fast scales a non-linear (squared) predation effect on fast coral, reflecting rapid declines when COTS density is high.
5. This enhancement is ecologically meaningful because it represents a threshold effect in fast coral susceptibility.
