Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model effectively simulates predator–prey dynamics between Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) and coral communities, including temperature‐mediated reproduction and Type‑III predation responses. However, it lacks an Allee effect on COTS reproduction. Ecologically, at very low densities, mate limitation can significantly reduce successful reproduction. Incorporating an Allee effect—using a sigmoidal function of previous COTS density—better captures the threshold behavior leading to rapid outbreak events once densities exceed a critical minimum. This improvement is key to modeling the abrupt boom–bust cycles observed in COTS populations.
