Assessment and Rationale:
The current model captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks through mechanisms such as density‐dependent regulation, an Allee effect, and cumulative damage for slow coral. However, fast coral dynamics did not include any persistent damage effect from predation. Fast-growing corals, despite their high intrinsic recovery rates, may still suffer lasting tissue damage, which can hinder their recovery following outbreaks. To address this oversight, we have introduced a new parameter "log_damage_fast" (set to 0.0 by default) to represent cumulative damage in fast coral. This adjustment improves the ecological realism by introducing a negative feedback on fast coral recovery, ensuring that the model better captures the impact of intense predation events.
