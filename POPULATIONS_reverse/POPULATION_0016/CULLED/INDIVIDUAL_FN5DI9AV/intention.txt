Assessment and Proposed Improvement:
The current model fits the boom‐bust cycle of COTS reasonably well but oversimplifies the environmental modulation of outbreaks. In particular, the linear response of coral cover influence (via the term total_coral/(half_sat + total_coral)) may not capture threshold effects that trigger and sustain outbreaks.

To address this, a new parameter "log_gamma" is introduced, with γ = exp(log_gamma), that acts as an exponent on the coral cover saturation term. Values greater than 1 amplify the sensitivity of the model to changes in coral cover, allowing a nonlinear (threshold‐like) response. This improvement is ecologically justified because the influence of coral cover on environmental efficiency may be highly nonlinear—especially under stress or near tipping points—and it improves predictions of outbreak timing and magnitude.

Note: Predictions still only use previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
