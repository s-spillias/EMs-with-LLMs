This model enhancement introduces temperature-dependent attack rates for Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) predation on corals. The modification is based on the ecological understanding that COTS feeding behavior and metabolic rates are strongly influenced by temperature.

The new parameter q_attack determines how sensitive the attack rates are to temperature deviations from the optimal temperature (T_opt). The temperature effect is modeled as an exponential function, where:

temp_effect_attack = exp(q_attack * (T - T_opt) / T_opt)

This formulation means that:
1. At T = T_opt, the effect multiplier equals 1 (no modification)
2. As temperature deviates from optimal, the attack rates change exponentially
3. The relative temperature difference (T - T_opt)/T_opt ensures the effect scales appropriately

The temperature-modified attack rates (alpha_slow_T, alpha_fast_T) then feed into the Holling Type II functional response equations. This mechanism allows COTS predation efficiency to vary with environmental conditions, potentially explaining some of the observed variability in coral cover and COTS populations that the previous model couldn't capture.

This addition is ecologically justified because:
- COTS are ectothermic organisms whose activity levels depend strongly on temperature
- Feeding rates in marine predators often show temperature dependence
- Variable predation pressure could help explain the observed population fluctuations
