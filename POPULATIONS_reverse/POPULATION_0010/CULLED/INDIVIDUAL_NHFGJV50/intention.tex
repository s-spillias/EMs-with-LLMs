The model has been enhanced to include temperature-dependent predation efficiency of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). This modification reflects the biological understanding that COTS feeding behavior and metabolic rates are strongly influenced by temperature.

The temperature effect on predation (temp_effect_pred) uses a Gaussian response curve centered around the optimal temperature (T_opt), but with a narrower width (sigma_T * 0.5) compared to other temperature effects. This represents that predation efficiency may be more sensitive to temperature than other processes.

The temperature-modified attack rates are implemented by multiplying the base attack rates (alpha_slow, alpha_fast) by the temperature effect term in the Holling Type II functional response equations. This means that COTS predation pressure on corals varies not just with prey density, but also with environmental conditions.

This mechanism could help explain the observed spikes in COTS populations and corresponding rapid declines in coral cover, as periods of optimal temperature would lead to more efficient predation and potentially trigger population outbreaks.
