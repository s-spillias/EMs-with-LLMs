\section{Size-Dependent Predation Vulnerability}

The model incorporates size-dependent vulnerability of corals to COTS predation, reflecting the ecological observation that smaller coral colonies are more susceptible to predation pressure. This mechanism is implemented through a vulnerability modifier that decreases as coral cover increases, representing the increased resilience of larger, more established coral colonies.

The vulnerability factor $v(C) = v_{max} \exp(-\beta C)$ where:
- $C$ is the coral cover
- $v_{max}$ is the maximum vulnerability (at low coral cover)
- $\beta$ controls how quickly vulnerability decreases with increasing coral cover

This modification better captures the dynamics of coral recovery and decline, particularly for slow-growing corals which show greater variability in their response to COTS predation pressure.
