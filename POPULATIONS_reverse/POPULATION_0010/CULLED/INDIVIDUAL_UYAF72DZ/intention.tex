\section{Model Description}

This model incorporates temperature-dependent predation vulnerability of corals to crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). The key ecological reasoning is that environmental stress makes corals more susceptible to predation through:

1. Reduced energy available for defense mechanisms
2. Compromised tissue integrity
3. Weakened chemical deterrents

The attack rates ($\alpha$) are modified by temperature stress according to:

$\alpha_{effective} = \alpha_{base} * (1 + \beta * |T - T_{opt}|)$

where $\beta$ represents the increase in predation vulnerability per degree of thermal stress. This creates an important feedback mechanism where environmental stress both directly reduces coral growth AND increases their vulnerability to predation.

Fast-growing corals are assumed to be more vulnerable to this effect ($\beta_{fast} > \beta_{slow}$) due to their reduced investment in defensive structures.
