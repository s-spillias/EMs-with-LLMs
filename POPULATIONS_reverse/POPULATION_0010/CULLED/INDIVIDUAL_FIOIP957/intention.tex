\section{Model Description}

The model incorporates temperature-dependent predation efficiency of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) on coral populations. This reflects how COTS feeding rates vary with temperature due to metabolic and behavioral changes. The attack rates ($\alpha$) are modified by a temperature-dependent efficiency term that peaks at optimal temperatures and declines at temperature extremes.

This mechanism is important because:
\begin{itemize}
\item COTS are ectothermic organisms whose activity and feeding rates are strongly influenced by temperature
\item Predation pressure on corals likely varies seasonally with temperature
\item Variable predation efficiency could help explain the observed fluctuations in both COTS and coral populations
\end{itemize}

The temperature-dependent predation efficiency is modeled using a Gaussian response curve similar to other physiological processes, but with its own optimal temperature and tolerance width parameters to allow for potential mismatch between optimal temperatures for COTS survival versus feeding activity.
