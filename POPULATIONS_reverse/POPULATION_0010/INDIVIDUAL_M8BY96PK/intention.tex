\section{Crown of Thorns Starfish - Coral Reef Ecosystem Model}

This Template Model Builder (TMB) implementation simulates the dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interactions with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model represents the coupled dynamics between COTS populations and two functional groups of corals, capturing key ecological processes and environmental dependencies.

\subsection{System Components}

\subsubsection{Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS)}
Population dynamics of coral-eating predator (individuals/mÂ²):
\begin{itemize}
\item Population growth through recruitment and immigration
\item Temperature-dependent feeding and growth rates
\item Density-dependent mortality
\item Prey switching behavior between coral types
\item Immigration pulses during outbreak years
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Slow-growing Corals}
Faviidae and Porites species (% cover):
\begin{itemize}
\item Lower intrinsic growth rates but higher resilience
\item Space-limited growth dynamics
\item Recovery from partial predation
\item Temperature stress responses
\item Competition with fast-growing corals
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fast-growing Corals}
Acropora species (% cover):
\begin{itemize}
\item Higher intrinsic growth rates but more vulnerable
\item Space-limited growth dynamics
\item Preferred prey for COTS
\item Higher susceptibility to temperature stress
\item Competition with slow-growing corals
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mechanistic representation of predator-prey dynamics
\item Temperature modulation of biological processes
\item Holling Type II functional responses for COTS feeding
\item Smooth transitions in competitive interactions
\item Density-dependent effects on population processes
\item Lognormal error structure for abundance observations
\item Parameter bounds based on coral reef ecology
\item Automatic differentiation for optimization
\end{itemize}
