This model modification introduces a coral cover-dependent feeding efficiency term for Crown-of-thorns Starfish (COTS). The efficiency multiplier increases linearly with total coral cover, representing the ecological mechanism where higher coral abundance allows COTS to feed more effectively by:

1. Reducing search time between coral colonies
2. Allowing COTS to remain in favorable feeding positions
3. Providing continuous access to food resources
4. Potentially supporting larger local COTS aggregations

This positive feedback mechanism helps explain the rapid population growth during outbreaks, as high coral cover enables more efficient feeding, which in turn supports faster COTS population growth until coral cover is reduced. The efficiency term is normalized by maximum coral cover (100%) to maintain reasonable biological bounds.

The modification builds on established predator-prey theory by incorporating prey-dependent capture efficiency, a phenomenon documented in coral reef systems where predator feeding rates can increase with prey density beyond what standard functional responses predict.
