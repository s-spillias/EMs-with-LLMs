This model enhancement introduces acute temperature stress effects on coral mortality, in addition to the existing chronic temperature effects on growth rates. The modification is based on extensive evidence that coral bleaching and mortality occur rapidly when temperatures exceed critical thresholds.

The new temperature response has two components:
1. Chronic effects (temp_chronic): A Gaussian response curve representing optimal growth conditions
2. Acute effects (temp_acute): An exponential increase in mortality above a critical temperature threshold

The acute response uses a quadratic term for temperatures above the critical threshold (T_crit) to capture the rapid onset of coral bleaching and mortality during marine heatwaves. This better represents the biological reality that corals can tolerate moderate temperature fluctuations but experience severe stress and mortality during acute heating events.

This mechanism helps explain the observed variability in coral cover, particularly the sharp declines that the previous model version couldn't capture. The separate treatment of chronic and acute temperature effects provides a more mechanistically accurate representation of how temperature influences coral population dynamics.
