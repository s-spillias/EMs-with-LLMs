\section{Density-Dependent Competition Model}

The model has been enhanced to include density-dependent competition between coral types. The competition strength now increases nonlinearly with total coral cover, reflecting how space and resource competition intensifies at higher densities.

The competition term uses a dampened density-dependent scaling factor for improved numerical stability:
\[ comp\_strength = comp\_coef \cdot (1 + 0.05 \cdot (\frac{total\_coral}{K\_coral})^{comp\_density}) \]

The growth terms for each population are now bounded to prevent excessive negative growth:
\[ growth_t = max(-N_{t-1}, r \cdot N_{t-1} \cdot f(environment, competition)) \]

This better represents the ecological reality that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Competition for space and resources becomes more intense as total coral cover increases
\item The effect of competition is not linear but increases more sharply at higher densities
\item Both coral types experience stronger competitive effects when the reef is more crowded
\end{itemize}

This mechanism helps explain the observed sharp peaks and subsequent declines in coral populations, as competition intensifies more strongly at high densities, potentially leading to more dramatic population changes.
