\section{Ecological Model Improvements}

\subsection{Coral-Dependent COTS Reproduction}

The model has been enhanced to include the ecological feedback between coral abundance and Crown-of-thorns Starfish (COTS) reproduction. This modification recognizes that COTS population growth is not simply density-dependent, but also relies on the availability of coral as a critical resource.

The new term $\beta_{repro}$ scales how total coral cover affects COTS reproduction rate. When coral is abundant (near K\_coral), COTS reproduction is enhanced by a factor of $(1 + \beta_{repro})$. When coral is scarce, reproduction approaches the base rate $r_{cots}$.

This mechanism better represents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The positive feedback between coral abundance and COTS population growth
    \item Resource-dependent reproduction common in marine invertebrates
    \item The potential for COTS population outbreaks when coral conditions are favorable
\end{itemize}

This modification should improve the model's ability to capture the observed COTS population spikes, which the previous version underestimated.
