The model incorporates a coral abundance-dependent mortality rate for crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). This modification represents how COTS survival improves with increased coral availability due to better nutrition and habitat conditions.

The mortality rate is modified by a factor: (1 - mort_coral_dep * (total_coral/(K_total + total_coral)))
This bounded form ensures:
1. Mortality reduction has a maximum effect (50% reduction)
2. The effect smoothly saturates as coral increases
3. The modification remains numerically stable
4. mort_coral_dep controls the strength of the relationship

This mechanism creates a stabilizing feedback:
- When coral is abundant, COTS survive better, potentially leading to outbreaks
- As COTS reduce coral cover, their mortality increases, eventually limiting population growth
- The bounded nature prevents unrealistic extremes while capturing the essential biological relationship

This implementation helps explain outbreak dynamics while maintaining model stability.
