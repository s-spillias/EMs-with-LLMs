\section{Temperature-Dependent COTS Growth}

We enhanced the model to better capture Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) population dynamics by incorporating temperature-dependent growth efficiency. The original model included temperature effects through a simple Gaussian response curve (temp\_effect), but this only scaled the overall growth rate linearly.

The new formulation introduces a growth efficiency multiplier that amplifies COTS population growth when temperatures are near optimal:

growth\_rate = r\_cots * (1.0 + temp\_effect * temp\_growth\_factor)

Where:
- temp\_growth\_factor is a parameter > 0 representing the strength of temperature enhancement
- temp\_effect is the existing Gaussian temperature response (0-1)

This creates a more realistic representation where:
1. At suboptimal temperatures (temp\_effect → 0), growth rate approaches the baseline r\_cots
2. Near optimal temperatures (temp\_effect → 1), growth rate increases proportionally with temp\_growth\_factor
3. The smooth transition follows the existing temperature response curve

This mechanism is ecologically justified as COTS are known to show enhanced metabolism, feeding rates, and reproductive success under optimal temperature conditions. The amplification effect helps explain observed population outbreaks during favorable conditions while maintaining more moderate growth during suboptimal periods.
