\section{Temperature-Dependent COTS Feeding}

The model has been enhanced to include temperature-dependent feeding rates for crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). Like other marine ectotherms, COTS metabolic rates and feeding activity increase with temperature up to an optimal temperature, beyond which performance declines. This relationship is modeled using a Gaussian temperature response curve similar to the one used for coral growth.

This modification better represents the physiological basis of COTS predation pressure, as feeding rates in marine predators are strongly influenced by environmental temperature. During warmer periods, increased feeding rates can amplify the impact of COTS on coral populations, potentially contributing to more severe outbreak effects.

The temperature effect on feeding is implemented by modifying the alpha_cots parameter (base feeding rate) with a temperature scaling factor. This creates an indirect pathway where environmental conditions affect the strength of predator-prey interactions.
