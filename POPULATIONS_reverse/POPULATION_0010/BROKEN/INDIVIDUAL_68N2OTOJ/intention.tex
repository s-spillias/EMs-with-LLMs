This model incorporates temperature-dependent coral mortality to better represent thermal stress impacts on reef dynamics. When sea surface temperatures exceed coral thermal tolerances, mortality increases following a threshold response function. This captures coral bleaching events and subsequent mortality, which is particularly important for slow-growing species that take longer to recover from thermal disturbances.

The temperature stress effect is modeled as:
temp_mortality = m_temp * max(0, (SST - T_crit))^2

Where:
- m_temp is the temperature-induced mortality rate
- T_crit is the critical temperature threshold
- SST is the sea surface temperature

This quadratic response above the critical threshold reflects how small temperature exceedances can cause significant mortality, matching empirical observations of coral bleaching events.
