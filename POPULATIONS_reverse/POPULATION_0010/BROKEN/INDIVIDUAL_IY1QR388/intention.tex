The model has been enhanced to include temperature-dependent predation rates for Crown-of-thorns Starfish (COTS). This modification reflects the ecological understanding that COTS feeding behavior and metabolic rates are strongly influenced by temperature.

The attack rates (a_slow and a_fast) are now scaled by the same temperature effect function used for growth rates. This creates a more realistic representation where COTS predation pressure on corals increases at optimal temperatures and decreases at temperature extremes. 

This mechanism helps explain the observed spikes in COTS populations and corresponding drops in coral cover during periods of favorable temperatures, as increased feeding efficiency can lead to rapid population growth through improved energy acquisition. The temperature-dependent predation rates create an additional indirect pathway between environmental conditions and coral mortality, potentially capturing more of the observed system dynamics.

The functional form maintains the Type II predator-prey response but now incorporates environmental modulation of predation efficiency, a key ecological process in marine systems.
