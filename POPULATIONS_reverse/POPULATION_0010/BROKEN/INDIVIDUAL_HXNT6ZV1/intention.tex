\section{Ecological Mechanism: Stress-Mediated Growth Reduction}

We introduced a stress-mediated growth reduction mechanism to better capture coral response to Crown-of-thorns Starfish (COTS) predation pressure. This addition is based on evidence that corals under predation stress exhibit reduced growth rates beyond direct tissue loss, as they divert resources to defense mechanisms.

The stress factor is modeled as a hyperbolic function:
\[ \text{stress\_factor} = \frac{1}{1 + \text{stress\_coef} \cdot \text{COTS}/K_\text{COTS}} \]

This creates an indirect feedback where high COTS densities suppress coral growth rates in addition to direct predation effects. The stress factor:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Approaches 1 (no effect) when COTS density is low
    \item Decreases towards 0 as COTS density increases
    \item Scales with relative COTS density (COTS/K\_COTS) to maintain ecological realism
\end{itemize}

This mechanism helps explain the rapid coral decline during COTS outbreaks seen in the historical data, as it captures both direct predation mortality and indirect stress effects on coral growth and recovery potential.
