This model modification introduces a coral abundance-dependent feeding efficiency for crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). The ecological reasoning is that COTS feeding becomes more efficient when coral prey is abundant, creating a positive feedback that can help explain outbreak dynamics.

The feeding efficiency modifier is implemented as a saturating function of total coral cover:
efficiency = 1 + feed_mod * total_coral / (feed_hs + total_coral)

This captures several important ecological mechanisms:
1. Base efficiency (1.0) when coral is scarce
2. Maximum efficiency increase (1 + feed_mod) when coral is abundant
3. Smooth transition via Holling Type II functional form
4. Half-saturation (feed_hs) represents the coral cover where efficiency enhancement is half maximum

This positive feedback helps explain why COTS outbreaks can develop rapidly when coral cover is high, as observed in the historical data. The mechanism is well-supported by field observations showing COTS feeding rates increase with prey density due to reduced search time and improved feeding success.
