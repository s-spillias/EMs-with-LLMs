This model enhancement introduces temperature-dependent feeding efficiency for Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS). While the original model included temperature effects on COTS population growth, it didn't account for how temperature affects their feeding behavior. Research shows that COTS feeding rates are strongly temperature-dependent, with optimal feeding occurring at temperatures slightly higher than their general physiological optimum.

The modification adds a separate temperature scaling function for feeding efficiency, using a Gaussian response curve similar to the population growth temperature response. This allows the model to better capture the intensity of coral predation during thermal conditions that favor COTS feeding activity, potentially explaining the observed sharp peaks in COTS impacts on coral cover.

This change is ecologically justified because:
1. COTS feeding behavior is known to be temperature-sensitive
2. Feeding optima often differ from growth optima in marine organisms
3. Enhanced feeding during optimal conditions can create stronger outbreak dynamics
4. Temperature-dependent predation rates are a well-established ecological mechanism

The separate optimal feeding temperature parameter (feed_temp_opt) allows the model to capture these distinct thermal effects on COTS behavior versus population growth.
