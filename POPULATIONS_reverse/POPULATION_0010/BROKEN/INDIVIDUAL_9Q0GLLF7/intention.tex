\section{Ecological Mechanisms}

The model has been simplified to focus on the most fundamental ecological processes in the coral-COTS system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic logistic growth of COTS populations
    \item Simple predator-prey interactions between COTS and corals
    \item Resource competition between coral types
    \item Direct immigration of COTS
\end{itemize}

Secondary effects have been temporarily removed to ensure numerical stability:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Temperature modulation of population dynamics
    \item Complex functional responses
    \item Density-dependent immigration
\end{itemize}

This core framework captures the essential dynamics while maintaining model stability. Additional complexity can be gradually reintroduced once the basic interactions are working properly.
