\section{Temperature-Dependent Growth Efficiency}

The model has been enhanced to include temperature-dependent growth efficiency for Crown-of-thorns Starfish (COTS). While the existing temperature effect term ($temp\_effect$) captures the basic thermal tolerance window, the new growth efficiency term ($growth\_efficiency$) represents how metabolic rates and feeding efficiency vary with temperature within that window.

The growth efficiency is modeled as a simple additive effect:
\[
growth\_efficiency = 1 + 0.1 \cdot \beta_{temp}
\]

where $\beta_{temp}$ is the temperature-growth effect parameter (exp(log\_temp\_growth\_effect)).

This formulation provides a conservative approach to temperature-dependent growth while maintaining numerical stability:
\begin{itemize}
\item Small additive adjustment to base growth rate
\item Independent of temperature tolerance function
\item Linear scaling with temperature parameter
\item Bounded effect size for numerical stability
\end{itemize}

This mechanism better represents how temperature affects COTS metabolism and feeding rates, which could help explain observed population spikes during favorable conditions.
