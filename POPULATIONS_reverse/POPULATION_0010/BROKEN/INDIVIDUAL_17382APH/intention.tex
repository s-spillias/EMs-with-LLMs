Crown of Thorns Starfish - Coral Reef Ecosystem Model

This Template Model Builder (TMB) implementation simulates the dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) populations and their interactions with coral reef communities. The model focuses on the differential impacts of COTS predation on slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites) versus fast-growing (Acropora) coral species.

System Components:

1. Crown of Thorns Starfish (A) - Adult population density (individuals/mÂ²)
- Temperature-dependent growth and mortality rates
- Density-dependent mortality
- Immigration from external populations
- Feeding preferences between coral types

2. Slow-growing Corals (S) - Faviidae and Porites cover (%)
- Lower intrinsic growth rates
- Higher resistance to predation
- Temperature-dependent growth
- Space limitation effects

3. Fast-growing Corals (F) - Acropora cover (%)
- Higher intrinsic growth rates
- More vulnerable to predation
- Temperature-dependent growth
- Space limitation effects

Key Model Features:
- Holling Type II functional responses for COTS predation
- Temperature-dependent vital rates
- Space competition between coral types
- External COTS immigration pulses
- Density-dependent COTS mortality
- Coral growth limitation by total cover
- Temperature stress effects on corals

Model Structure:
- State variables tracked in continuous time
- Environmental forcing via temperature
- COTS immigration as external forcing
- Lognormal observation error structure
- Smooth parameter bounds and transitions
- Process-specific efficiency parameters

Applications:
- Prediction of COTS outbreak dynamics
- Assessment of coral community responses
- Evaluation of temperature effects
- Investigation of coral recovery potential
- Support for management decisions
