This modification adds nutrient-dependent recruitment to the COTS population dynamics using a Monod (saturation) function. The ecological reasoning is:

1. COTS larvae feed on phytoplankton, which bloom under high nutrient conditions
2. Higher phytoplankton abundance increases larval survival and recruitment success
3. This creates a positive feedback where nutrient pulses can trigger COTS outbreaks
4. The saturation function captures diminishing returns of nutrient enrichment

The Monod function parameters are:
- r_nutr: maximum recruitment enhancement at saturating nutrients
- K_nutr: nutrient concentration for half-maximum enhancement

This better represents the mechanism by which terrestrial runoff can trigger COTS outbreaks through enhanced larval survival, rather than just adult immigration. The saturation function prevents unbounded growth while maintaining sensitivity to nutrient pulses.
