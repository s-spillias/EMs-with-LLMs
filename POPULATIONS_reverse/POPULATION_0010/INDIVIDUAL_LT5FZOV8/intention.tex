The model has been enhanced to include a more realistic representation of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics by incorporating resource-dependent reproduction. In the original model, COTS population growth was linked to predation but didn't explicitly account for how coral abundance affects COTS reproduction.

The new formulation includes a resource-dependent reproduction term where COTS population growth is directly tied to coral consumption through the parameter β (beta). This better represents the biological reality that COTS require adequate coral tissue consumption to fuel reproduction. The reproduction term is calculated as:

reproduction = β * (f_slow + f_fast) * total_cover

where:
- β represents the efficiency of converting consumed coral tissue into new COTS individuals
- (f_slow + f_fast) captures the total predation rate
- total_cover scales the reproduction based on available coral resources

This modification creates a more realistic feedback loop between coral abundance and COTS population dynamics, which is crucial for capturing outbreak cycles. When coral cover is high, COTS reproduction increases, potentially leading to outbreaks. As corals are depleted, COTS reproduction decreases, allowing coral recovery - a pattern observed in real reef systems.
