Assessment:

1. Model Fit: Based on the images, the model captures the general trends in COTS, slow-growing coral, and fast-growing coral, but struggles to accurately predict the magnitude and timing of peaks, particularly for COTS and slow-growing coral. The model seems to underestimate the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks.
2. Project Context: The model addresses the core aspects of the project context by simulating COTS outbreaks and their impact on coral communities. However, the relatively poor fit to the data, especially regarding outbreak timing and magnitude, suggests that key outbreak dynamics are not fully captured.
3. Missing Ecological Processes: A key simplification appears to be in the COTS larval immigration term. The current model uses a density-dependent term that reduces immigration as the adult COTS population increases. While this represents a form of self-regulation, it doesn't account for external factors that might trigger or amplify immigration events, such as favorable oceanographic conditions for larval dispersal or pulses of larvae from distant reefs. The model also doesn't account for the spatial dynamics of COTS outbreaks, which can influence local larval supply.

Proposed Improvement:

To improve the model's ability to capture COTS outbreak dynamics, I propose incorporating an environmental modifier to the COTS larval immigration rate. Specifically, I will add a term that increases larval immigration when sea surface temperature (SST) is within a favorable range for larval survival and settlement. This approach acknowledges that SST can play a crucial role in COTS larval development and recruitment, potentially triggering or exacerbating outbreaks.

Ecological Justification:

COTS larval survival and settlement are highly sensitive to temperature. Warmer temperatures within a certain range can accelerate larval development and increase settlement success, leading to larger recruitment events and potentially triggering outbreaks. By incorporating an SST-dependent term into the larval immigration rate, the model can better capture the influence of environmental conditions on COTS population dynamics.
