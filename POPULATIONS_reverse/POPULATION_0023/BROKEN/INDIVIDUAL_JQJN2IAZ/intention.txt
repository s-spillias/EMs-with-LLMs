The current model captures the general trends but struggles to accurately predict the magnitude and timing of the COTS outbreaks and coral decline/recovery. The model also lacks environmental modifiers.

I propose incorporating a temperature-dependent effect on COTS mortality rate. Sea surface temperature (SST) can significantly influence the metabolic rates and feeding behavior of marine organisms like COTS. By making the mortality rate temperature-dependent, the model can better capture the environmental influence on COTS dynamics and potentially improve the prediction of outbreak events.
