The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. Coral predictions also deviate from observed data. The model uses a Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation, which may be oversimplified.

I propose incorporating a Type III functional response for COTS predation on fast-growing corals. This adds a density-dependent component to the predation rate, reflecting increased feeding efficiency at higher COTS densities. This can lead to more rapid and pronounced outbreaks.
