Assessment:
The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. Coral cover predictions also deviate from observed data. The model addresses boom-bust cycles but could better capture outbreak triggers and selective predation.

Proposed Improvement:
Incorporate a density-dependent effect on COTS predation. Modify the Holling type II functional response to include a term that reduces predation efficiency at high COTS densities. This can help to better capture the rapid population explosions and subsequent declines observed in COTS outbreaks.
