The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. Coral predictions also deviate from data. The model lacks density-dependent mechanisms for COTS regulation.

Improvement: Incorporate a density-dependent cannibalism term into the COTS population dynamics. Cannibalism is a known behavior in COTS, especially among juveniles, and can act as a strong self-regulation mechanism at high population densities, contributing to the rapid decline after an outbreak peak.
