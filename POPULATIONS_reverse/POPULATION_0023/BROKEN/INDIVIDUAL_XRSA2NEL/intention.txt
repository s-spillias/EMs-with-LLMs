This model simulates Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. It captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks, driven by factors such as larval immigration, sea surface temperature, and coral availability. The model incorporates COTS predation on slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals, with functional responses that reflect observed feeding preferences. Environmental conditions (sea surface temperature) modulate COTS recruitment and survival rates. The model predicts COTS abundance, slow-growing coral cover, and fast-growing coral cover over time, allowing for assessment of outbreak drivers and impacts on coral reef ecosystems.
