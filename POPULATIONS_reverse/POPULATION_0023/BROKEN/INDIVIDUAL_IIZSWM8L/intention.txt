This model simulates Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) outbreaks and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model incorporates key ecological processes driving COTS population dynamics, including larval immigration, density-dependent recruitment, adult mortality, and predation on corals. Coral communities are divided into fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) types, reflecting COTS's preference for Acropora. The model aims to capture the boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks and their effects on coral cover. Environmental factors, such as sea surface temperature, influence COTS larval survival and recruitment. The model predicts COTS abundance, fast-growing coral cover, and slow-growing coral cover over time.
