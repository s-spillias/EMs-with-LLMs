The model simulates Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. It captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks, driven by larval supply, sea surface temperature (SST), and coral availability. The model includes three coral functional groups: slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites), fast-growing corals (Acropora), and existing COTS. COTS predation rates depend on coral cover and SST influences COTS larval survival and recruitment. The model predicts COTS abundance, slow-growing coral cover, and fast-growing coral cover over time, forced by SST and COTS larval immigration.
