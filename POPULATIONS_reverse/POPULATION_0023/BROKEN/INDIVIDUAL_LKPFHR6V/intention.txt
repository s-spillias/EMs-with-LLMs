This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. It aims to capture the episodic outbreak events characterized by rapid population increases followed by declines. The model incorporates key ecological processes such as COTS larval immigration, density-dependent reproduction, predation on different coral types (fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites), and the influence of sea surface temperature on COTS survival and reproduction. The model predicts COTS abundance, slow-growing coral cover, and fast-growing coral cover over time, allowing for the investigation of outbreak triggers and the long-term effects of COTS predation on coral community structure.
