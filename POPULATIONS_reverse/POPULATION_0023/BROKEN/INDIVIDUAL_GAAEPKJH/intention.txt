The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. It simplifies COTS larval immigration by only considering density dependence.

To improve the model, I will incorporate a nutrient-dependent term into the COTS larval immigration rate, using a Holling type II functional response. This will allow the model to capture the influence of bottom-up forcing on COTS outbreaks. Nutrient availability is a limiting factor for phytoplankton growth, which in turn affects COTS larval survival. I will also rescale the COTS larval immigration data to improve numerical stability.
