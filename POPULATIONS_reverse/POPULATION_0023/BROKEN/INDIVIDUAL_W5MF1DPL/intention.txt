The model was assessed and found to capture general trends but struggled with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. To improve this, the Allee effect on COTS reproduction and recruitment was enhanced. A new parameter, `log_allee_imm_strength`, was added to control the strength of this effect on larval immigration.

In `model.cpp`, the COTS larval immigration calculation was modified to incorporate this enhanced Allee effect. The term `(1.0 - exp(-allee_imm_strength * allee_effect))` scales the density-dependent larval immigration, making it more sensitive to low COTS densities. This modification aims to better represent the critical population density required for successful fertilization and larval survival, thereby improving the model's ability to predict outbreak events.
