The model captures the general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of the COTS outbreaks. The coral predictions also deviate significantly from the observed data. A key missing element is the Allee effect in COTS reproduction or aggregation. COTS require a certain population density to successfully reproduce. This can lead to a boom-bust dynamic.

I propose incorporating an Allee effect into the COTS population dynamics. This can be implemented by modifying the COTS growth term to include a density-dependent component that reduces growth at low population densities. This will make the model more likely to produce boom-bust cycles.
