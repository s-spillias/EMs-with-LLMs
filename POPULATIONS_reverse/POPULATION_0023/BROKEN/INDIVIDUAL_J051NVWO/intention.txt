The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. To improve the model's ability to capture outbreak dynamics, an SST-dependent term is incorporated into the COTS larval immigration rate. This modification accounts for the influence of sea surface temperature on COTS larval survival and recruitment, potentially acting as a trigger for outbreaks. A quadratic relationship between SST and larval immigration is assumed, reflecting an optimal temperature range for larval survival. To improve the model's ability to capture the magnitude of COTS outbreaks, a density-dependent mortality term is incorporated. This modification represents increased competition or disease at high COTS densities, potentially regulating outbreak intensity.
