The current model captures the general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of the COTS outbreaks. The modeled coral cover also deviates significantly from the observed data in certain periods. The model oversimplifies the COTS predation by using a Holling type II functional response, which doesn't account for satiation or handling time. The coral dynamics also lack complexity, with simple logistic growth and a combined carrying capacity term. The model doesn't explicitly include any environmental factors, which can significantly influence COTS outbreaks. Density-dependent mechanisms beyond simple logistic growth are also absent.

I propose incorporating a density-dependent aggregation term in the COTS predation rate. COTS are known to aggregate at high densities, which can lead to increased feeding efficiency and localized depletion of coral. This aggregation behavior can drive the rapid increase in COTS numbers during outbreaks and intensify the impact on coral cover. I will modify the predation term to include a Hill function, which allows for a sigmoidal response to COTS density. This will introduce a threshold effect, where predation increases slowly at low COTS densities but accelerates rapidly once a certain density is reached.
