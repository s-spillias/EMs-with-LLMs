This model simulates Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the boom-bust dynamics and coral predation. It incorporates key ecological processes like COTS larval immigration, density-dependent reproduction, and size-selective coral predation (Acropora, Faviidae/Porites). The model predicts COTS abundance and coral cover changes over time, driven by environmental factors (sea surface temperature) and internal population dynamics. The goal is to understand outbreak triggers and improve predictions of future COTS events.
