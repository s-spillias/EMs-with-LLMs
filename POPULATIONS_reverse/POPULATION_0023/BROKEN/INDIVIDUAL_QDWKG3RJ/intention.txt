The model captures general trends but struggles with peak magnitudes and timing, especially for COTS and fast-growing coral. The fixed carrying capacity for COTS is a potential oversimplification.

Improvement: Implement a coral-dependent carrying capacity for COTS, scaling K_cots by the total coral cover (fast + slow) relative to the maximum possible coral cover (K_fast + K_slow). This reflects the food-limited nature of COTS populations.
