The current model captures the basic interactions between COTS and coral, but it oversimplifies the outbreak dynamics. The triggers and sustaining mechanisms of outbreaks are not well represented, leading to poor predictions of outbreak timing and magnitude. A key missing element is a more realistic representation of COTS recruitment and early survival. The current model includes SST and larval immigration effects, but these are linear and don't account for Allee effects (density-dependent survival at low population densities) or other non-linear recruitment processes. The assumption of constant larval supply may also be unrealistic.

To improve the model, a density-dependent recruitment term for COTS will be incorporated. This will represent Allee effects, where COTS survival is reduced at low densities due to factors like reduced fertilization success or increased predation pressure on juveniles. This will add a non-linear element to the COTS population dynamics, potentially allowing for more realistic outbreak behavior. A Hill function will be used to represent this effect.
