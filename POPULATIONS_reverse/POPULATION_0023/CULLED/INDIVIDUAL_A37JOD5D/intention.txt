This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. It aims to capture the episodic outbreak events characterized by rapid population increases followed by declines. The model incorporates key ecological processes such as COTS larval immigration, density-dependent reproduction, predation on different coral types (fast-growing Acropora, slow-growing Faviidae and Porites), and the influence of environmental factors like sea surface temperature (SST). The model predicts COTS abundance, coral cover, and the timing/magnitude of outbreaks. Feedback loops, such as coral recovery influencing subsequent COTS outbreaks, are also included.
