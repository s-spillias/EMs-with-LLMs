Assessment of the Current Model:

1. Model Fit: Based on the provided images, the model captures the general trends in COTS, slow-growing coral, and fast-growing coral abundance. However, the model struggles to accurately predict the magnitude and timing of peak outbreaks, particularly for COTS. The modeled coral cover also appears to have less variability than the observed data.
2. Ecological Context: The model incorporates key ecological processes such as COTS growth, predation on coral, coral growth, and temperature-dependent mortality. It also includes larval immigration, which is important for initiating outbreaks.
3. Missing Processes: A key simplification is the lack of explicit density dependence in COTS mortality. The current model includes density dependence in larval immigration, but not in natural mortality or predation. As COTS populations increase to outbreak levels, intraspecific competition for resources (e.g., food) and increased susceptibility to disease or predation could become significant factors limiting population growth and contributing to the "bust" phase of the cycle.

Proposed Improvement:

I propose incorporating density dependence into the natural mortality rate of COTS. This can be implemented by making the mortality rate a function of COTS density. This will add a self-regulation mechanism that can help to better capture the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks.

Mathematical Representation:

I will use a simple linear function to represent density-dependent mortality:

m_cots_effective = m_cots + d * cots_pred(t-1)

where:

* m_cots_effective is the effective mortality rate.
* m_cots is the baseline mortality rate (as in the current model).
* d is a new parameter representing the strength of density dependence.
* cots_pred(t-1) is the COTS density at the previous time step.

This formulation increases the mortality rate as COTS density increases, reflecting increased competition, disease, or predation pressure at high densities.

Implementation:

I will add a new parameter log_d_cots to parameters.json and transform it to d in model.cpp. I will then modify the COTS population dynamics equation in model.cpp to incorporate the density-dependent mortality term.
