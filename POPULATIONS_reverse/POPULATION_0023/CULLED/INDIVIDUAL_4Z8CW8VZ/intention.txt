The current model captures some trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. The carrying capacity and predation terms are oversimplified. The model lacks a mechanism for density-dependent mortality in COTS.

I propose incorporating density-dependent mortality into the COTS population dynamics by adding a quadratic mortality term. This will allow the model to better capture the decline phase of COTS outbreaks and improve the overall fit to the observed data.
