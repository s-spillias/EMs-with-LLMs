The model simulates Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics and their impact on coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef. It incorporates key ecological processes driving COTS outbreaks, including larval immigration, sea surface temperature effects on larval survival, and COTS predation on different coral types (fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites). The model predicts COTS abundance, slow-growing coral cover, and fast-growing coral cover over time, capturing boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS outbreaks. Resource limitation is modeled through coral cover influencing COTS carrying capacity. The model accounts for observation error in COTS abundance and coral cover data.
