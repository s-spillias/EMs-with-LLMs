The model captures the general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of the COTS outbreaks, particularly the initial outbreak. The coral cover predictions also deviate from the observed data, suggesting potential issues with the coral dynamics or their interaction with COTS. The Holling type II functional response might not adequately capture the dynamics at high COTS densities.

To improve the model, I incorporated a density-dependent effect on COTS larval immigration. The current model treats larval immigration as a fixed input, but in reality, successful settlement and recruitment of larvae might be limited by the existing COTS population density due to factors like competition for resources or cannibalism. This was implemented using a Ricker-type density dependence on larval settlement. A new parameter, log_density_dependence_cotsimm, was added to control the strength of this effect.
