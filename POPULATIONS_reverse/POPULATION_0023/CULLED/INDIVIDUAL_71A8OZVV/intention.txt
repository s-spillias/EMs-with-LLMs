This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model aims to capture the episodic outbreak events characterized by rapid population explosions followed by declines.

The model incorporates the following key ecological processes:

1.  COTS Population Dynamics:
    *   Recruitment: COTS larval immigration rate, potentially influenced by environmental factors (e.g., sea surface temperature).
    *   Mortality: Natural mortality and starvation-induced mortality, influenced by coral availability.
    *   Predation: Density-dependent predation on COTS by natural predators (e.g., giant triton snails, fish).

2.  Coral Community Dynamics:
    *   Coral Cover: Three coral groups are modeled: slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites), fast-growing corals (Acropora), and a "healthy" coral state.
    *   COTS Predation: COTS preferentially prey on Acropora, shifting to slow-growing corals when Acropora is depleted. Predation rates are modeled using functional responses.
    *   Coral Growth: Coral growth rates are influenced by environmental factors (e.g., sea surface temperature).
    *   Coral Mortality: Natural mortality and mortality due to other factors (e.g., bleaching, storms).

3.  Environmental Influences:
    *   Sea Surface Temperature (SST): SST affects coral growth rates, COTS recruitment, and potentially COTS mortality.

4.  Outbreak Triggers and Sustainability:
    *   Larval Immigration: Episodic increases in larval supply can trigger outbreaks.
    *   Coral Availability: High coral cover can sustain outbreaks by providing ample food for COTS.
    *   Predator-Prey Dynamics: Reduced predator populations can lead to COTS outbreaks.

The model predicts COTS abundance, coral cover (for each group), and the timing/magnitude/duration of outbreak events. It accounts for resource limitation, process-specific efficiencies, environmental influences, and feedback loops between components. The model uses smooth functions and bounds to ensure numerical stability and biologically realistic parameter values.
