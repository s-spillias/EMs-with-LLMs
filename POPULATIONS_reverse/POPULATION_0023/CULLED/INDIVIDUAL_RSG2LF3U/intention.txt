The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. The outbreak trigger is oversimplified.

To improve the model, I'm incorporating a density-dependent component to the outbreak boost. This means the outbreak boost to COTS growth will be more pronounced at higher COTS densities. This reflects potential Allee effects or cooperative behaviors that facilitate outbreak initiation.
