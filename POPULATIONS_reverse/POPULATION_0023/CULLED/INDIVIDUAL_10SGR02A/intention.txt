The current model captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS and their selective predation on coral, but the timing and magnitude of outbreaks are not well-aligned with the data. The model also oversimplifies the outbreak trigger mechanism and lacks density-dependent effects on COTS predation.

To improve the model, I propose incorporating a density-dependent predation rate on coral by COTS, using a Holling type II functional response. This introduces a saturation effect, where the predation rate plateaus as COTS density increases. This is ecologically plausible because individual COTS can only consume so much coral within a given time period, and at high COTS densities, individuals may spend more time competing for resources or experience reduced foraging efficiency due to crowding. This density-dependent effect can help to better regulate COTS populations and improve the model's ability to capture the observed outbreak dynamics.
