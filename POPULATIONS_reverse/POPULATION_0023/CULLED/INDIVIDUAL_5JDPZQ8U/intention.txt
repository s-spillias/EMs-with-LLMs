The model was assessed and found to capture general trends but struggled with the magnitude and timing of peaks. It also simplifies coral dynamics and doesn't account for environmental factors.

The proposed improvement is to incorporate a temperature-dependent mortality rate for corals. Coral bleaching events, triggered by high SST, can significantly impact coral cover and alter the dynamics of the entire system. This aligns well with the project's emphasis on capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions, as temperature-induced coral mortality can weaken coral resistance to COTS predation and potentially trigger outbreaks.

The implementation involves adding parameters for the sensitivity of fast and slow-growing corals to SST and modifying the coral mortality terms to include a temperature-dependent component.
