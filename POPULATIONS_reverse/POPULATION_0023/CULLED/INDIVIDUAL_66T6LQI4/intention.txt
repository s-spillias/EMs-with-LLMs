The current model captures the basic dynamics of COTS outbreaks and coral predation but lacks the complexity to accurately simulate the episodic nature of outbreaks and the nuances of coral community dynamics. A key simplification is the lack of density-dependent effects on COTS predation. The current model assumes a linear relationship between COTS density and predation rate, which may not be realistic. At high COTS densities, handling time and other interference mechanisms could limit the per capita predation rate.

I propose incorporating a Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation on both slow- and fast-growing corals. This will introduce a saturating effect, where the predation rate per COTS decreases as coral cover decreases, or as COTS density increases due to handling time. This is a meaningful ecological improvement because it acknowledges that COTS have limited capacity to consume coral, and this limitation can influence the dynamics of outbreaks.
