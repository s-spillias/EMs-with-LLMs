The current model struggles to accurately capture the dynamics of coral cover, particularly for fast-growing corals. The modeled coral cover quickly drops to zero and remains there, failing to reflect the fluctuations observed in the historical data. The COTS predictions also appear to have some discrepancies with the data. A key missing element is a more nuanced representation of COTS feeding behavior. The current model assumes a constant predation rate. In reality, COTS might exhibit a preference for certain coral types when available, and switch to others when their preferred food source becomes scarce. This adaptive feeding behavior could significantly influence the dynamics of coral communities.

I propose incorporating a Holling type II functional response for COTS predation on both slow and fast-growing corals. This will introduce a saturating effect, where the predation rate decreases as coral cover declines. This is a more realistic representation of COTS feeding behavior, as they cannot consume an unlimited amount of coral. This also introduces a preference parameter, allowing COTS to preferentially feed on fast or slow growing corals.
