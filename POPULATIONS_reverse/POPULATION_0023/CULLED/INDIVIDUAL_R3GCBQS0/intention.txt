Assessment:

The current model captures the general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. The Holling type II functional response for COTS predation may be oversimplified.

Proposed Improvement:

Implement a Holling type III functional response for COTS predation on both fast and slow-growing corals. This includes a density-dependent effect on COTS predation, which can better capture the dynamics of COTS outbreaks. The Holling type III functional response includes a term that initially increases predation rate slowly at low COTS densities, then increases more rapidly, and finally saturates at high densities. This can better capture the dynamics of COTS outbreaks, where initial increases in COTS density may have a limited impact on coral cover until a threshold density is reached.
