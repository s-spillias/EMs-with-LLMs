The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. A key missing element is a density-dependent mortality factor for COTS. The model will be improved by adding a quadratic mortality term to the COTS population dynamics equation. This will introduce a higher mortality rate when COTS densities are high, leading to a more rapid decline after an outbreak, better capturing the "bust" phase of the COTS outbreaks due to factors like disease or starvation.
