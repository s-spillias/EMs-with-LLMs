The current model struggles to capture the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. The modeled COTS abundance appears to be significantly lower than the historical data, and the coral cover predictions do not closely follow the observed trends.

To improve the model, I propose incorporating a Holling type III functional response for COTS predation on coral, but with a saturating "preference" for fast coral. The current model uses a Holling type III response, but it doesn't account for the fact that COTS may become satiated with fast coral and switch to slow coral even if fast coral is still available. This could help explain the boom-bust cycles, as COTS initially decimate fast-growing coral and then switch to slow-growing coral, leading to a population decline.

I have added a new parameter, log_pref_max, which represents the log of the maximum preference for fast-growing coral. In the model.cpp file, I have modified the predation equations to incorporate this saturating preference.
