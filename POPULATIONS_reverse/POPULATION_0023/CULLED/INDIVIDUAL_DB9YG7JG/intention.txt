The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks and coral recovery. The Holling type II predation may be oversimplified.

To improve the model, I will incorporate a temperature-dependent effect on the COTS growth rate. Sea surface temperature (SST) influences COTS larval development and survival. I will modify the COTS growth rate to include a quadratic function representing the temperature effect, assuming an optimal temperature for COTS growth with decreased growth at higher and lower temperatures. This will involve adding parameters for the optimal temperature (`T_opt_cots`) and temperature sensitivity (`temp_sens_cots`).
