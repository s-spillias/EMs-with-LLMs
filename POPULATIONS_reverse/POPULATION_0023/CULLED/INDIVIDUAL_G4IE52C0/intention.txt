Assessment of the Current Model:
1. Model Fit: Based on the provided images, the model captures the general trends in COTS, slow-growing coral, and fast-growing coral populations, but it struggles to accurately predict the magnitude and timing of peaks and troughs, especially for COTS and slow-growing coral. The modeled coral cover also appears to decline too rapidly after COTS outbreaks.
2. Ecological Processes: The current model includes key processes like COTS growth, predation, coral growth, and COTS immigration. However, it simplifies the coral dynamics by assuming a constant carrying capacity and mortality rate. It also uses a Holling type II functional response for COTS predation, which may not fully capture the complexities of predator-prey interactions in this system.
3. Missing Processes: One potentially important missing process is the effect of environmental factors, particularly sea surface temperature (SST), on coral bleaching and mortality. High SST can cause coral bleaching, making them more vulnerable to COTS predation and other stressors. The model currently includes SST data, but it is not used to modify any processes.

Proposed Improvement:
I propose incorporating the effect of SST on coral mortality rates. Specifically, I will add a temperature-dependent mortality term to the fast-growing and slow-growing coral equations. This will allow the model to capture the increased coral mortality during periods of high SST, which can exacerbate the impact of COTS outbreaks. I will use a simple quadratic function to represent the relationship between SST and coral mortality, with mortality increasing as SST deviates from an optimal temperature.

Ecological Justification:
Coral bleaching is a major threat to coral reefs worldwide, and it is primarily caused by elevated SST. Bleached corals are more susceptible to disease and predation, leading to increased mortality. By incorporating the effect of SST on coral mortality, the model will be better able to capture the dynamics of coral populations in response to both COTS outbreaks and climate change.
