The model captures general trends but struggles with peak timing and magnitude, especially for COTS and fast-growing coral. It also underestimates data variability. A key simplification is the lack of explicit environmental forcing on COTS dynamics.

Improvement: Incorporate a temperature-dependent effect on the COTS intrinsic growth rate (`r_cots`) using a quadratic function to model the relationship between SST and `r_cots`, assuming an optimal temperature for COTS growth. This acknowledges the influence of temperature on COTS larval development, survival, and feeding rates, allowing the model to respond to observed SST fluctuations.
