The current model captures general trends but struggles with outbreak timing and magnitude. Coral predictions also deviate from data. A key missing element is the Allee effect in COTS reproduction, where fertilization success is low at low densities. This update incorporates an Allee effect into the COTS population dynamics by modifying the logistic growth term to include a factor that reduces growth at low COTS densities. This adds a new parameter, `log_allee_cots`, representing the COTS density at which the Allee effect significantly reduces growth.
