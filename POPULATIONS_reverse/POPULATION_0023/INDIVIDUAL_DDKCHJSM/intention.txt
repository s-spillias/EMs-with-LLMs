The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS and fast-growing coral peaks. The model incorporates COTS population dynamics, coral community structure, and COTS predation, but the mechanisms driving outbreak events may be oversimplified.

To improve the model, an Allee effect will be incorporated into the COTS population dynamics. This will be implemented by modifying the growth term to include a factor that reduces growth at low COTS densities. The Allee effect will be modeled using a simple ratio-dependent formulation.

The Allee effect is a well-documented phenomenon in marine invertebrates, including starfish. It arises from various mechanisms, such as reduced fertilization success at low densities, increased vulnerability to predation, or reduced foraging efficiency. By incorporating the Allee effect, the model will be better able to capture the threshold dynamics that can trigger COTS outbreaks. This improvement directly addresses the project context by focusing on mechanisms that drive and sustain outbreak events.
