The current model captures general trends but struggles with outbreak timing and magnitude. Coral predictions also deviate from data. The model lacks an Allee effect, which could explain sudden outbreaks. I'm adding an Allee effect to the COTS population dynamics by modifying the growth term to include a density-dependent factor that reduces growth at low COTS densities. This will add a parameter to represent the Allee threshold.
