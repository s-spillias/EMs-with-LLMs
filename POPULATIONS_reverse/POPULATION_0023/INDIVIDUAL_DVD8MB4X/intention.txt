Model Assessment:
The current model captures general trends but struggles with the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks. Coral predictions also deviate from observed data. The Holling type II functional response oversimplifies COTS predation.

Proposed Improvement:
Incorporate a Holling type III functional response for COTS predation on coral. This includes a quadratic term in the denominator, allowing for a slower initial increase in predation rate at low COTS densities, potentially reflecting COTS aggregation behavior and a saturation constant to limit the magnitude of outbreaks.
