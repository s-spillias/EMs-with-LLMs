This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks COTS abundance and two coral functional groups: slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals.

Key ecological processes include:
1. COTS predation on both coral types with preference for fast-growing corals
2. Temperature-dependent coral growth and mortality
3. COTS population dynamics influenced by immigration and density-dependence
4. Coral recovery through growth and recruitment

The model aims to capture the cyclic nature of COTS outbreaks and their differential impacts on coral communities, considering environmental forcing through sea surface temperature.
