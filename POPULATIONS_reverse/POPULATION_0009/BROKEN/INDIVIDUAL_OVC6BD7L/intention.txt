Added interspecific competition between fast and slow-growing corals to better capture their population dynamics. The competition coefficients (beta_slow_fast and beta_fast_slow) allow asymmetric effects where fast-growing corals may have stronger competitive effects on slow-growing corals than vice versa. This should improve the fit by better representing the biological interactions between coral types.
