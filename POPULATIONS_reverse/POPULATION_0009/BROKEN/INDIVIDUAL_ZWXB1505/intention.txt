This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on two coral functional groups on the Great Barrier Reef: slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing corals (Acropora). The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS population growth
2. Differential feeding preferences of COTS on fast vs. slow-growing corals
3. Natural coral growth and recovery processes
4. External COTS immigration events
5. Temperature stress effects on coral mortality

The model uses annual time steps and represents densities in individuals/mÂ² for COTS and percent cover for corals. It incorporates both density-dependent feedback in COTS population growth and coral recovery rates.
