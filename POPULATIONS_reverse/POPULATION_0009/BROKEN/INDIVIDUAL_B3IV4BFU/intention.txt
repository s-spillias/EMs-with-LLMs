This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks three main state variables:
1. COTS adult population density (individuals/mÂ²)
2. Slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites spp.) (%)
3. Fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp.) (%)

Key ecological processes include:
- Temperature-dependent COTS reproduction and survival
- Immigration of COTS larvae from external sources
- Differential feeding rates on slow vs. fast-growing corals
- Coral growth and recovery
- Temperature stress effects on coral mortality

The model uses time series data from 1980-2005 to estimate parameters and predict population dynamics.
