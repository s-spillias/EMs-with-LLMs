Added Allee effect to coral growth rates, where population growth is reduced at low densities. This reflects the biological reality that corals need sufficient density for successful reproduction and recruitment. The Allee effect should help explain the difficulty of coral recovery from very low populations and contribute to the observed variability in coral populations.
