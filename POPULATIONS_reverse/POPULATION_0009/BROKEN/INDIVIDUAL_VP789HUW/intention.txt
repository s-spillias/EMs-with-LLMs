This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks:

1. COTS population density (individuals/mÂ²)
2. Slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites spp.) (%)
3. Fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp.) (%)

Key ecological processes included:
- Temperature-dependent COTS growth and mortality
- Coral-dependent COTS feeding rates
- Different growth rates for slow vs fast-growing corals
- External COTS immigration
- Density-dependent COTS mortality
- Coral recovery rates

The model uses time series data from 1980-2005 including sea surface temperature, COTS abundance, and coral cover measurements.
