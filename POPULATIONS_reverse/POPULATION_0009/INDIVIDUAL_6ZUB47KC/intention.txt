This model describes the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks:

1. COTS population dynamics influenced by:
   - Temperature-dependent reproduction
   - Density-dependent mortality
   - External immigration

2. Two coral functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora)

3. Key ecological processes:
   - Coral growth (logistic)
   - COTS predation on corals (functional response)
   - Different feeding preferences for coral types
   - Temperature stress effects on corals

The model uses time series data of COTS abundance, coral cover percentages, sea surface temperature, and COTS immigration rates to estimate ecological parameters and predict system dynamics.
