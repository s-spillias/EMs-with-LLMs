I'll help create a TMB model for the Crown of     
Thorns (COTS) starfish system. Let's start by     
creating the three files:

 =======                                          
 This model simulates the population dynamics of  
 Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact 
 on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef.  
 The model tracks:                                
                                                  
 1. COTS population density (individuals/mÂ²)      
 2. Slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porite 
 spp.) (%)                                        
 3. Fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp.) (%)  
                                                  
 Key ecological processes include:                
 - Temperature-dependent COTS reproduction and    
 mortality                                        
 - COTS immigration from external sources         
 - Preferential feeding of COTS on fast-growing   
 corals                                           
 - Different growth rates between coral types     
 - Density-dependent coral growth and space       
 competition

This model implements a coupled system of COTS and
coral dynamics with the following key features:   

 1 Temperature-dependent COTS population growth   
 2 External COTS immigration                      
 3 Differential predation rates on slow vs        
   fast-growing corals                            
 4 Space competition between coral types          
 5 Lognormal observation error for all state      
   variables                                      

The model uses smooth transitions and includes    
small constants to prevent numerical              
instabilities. All parameters are biologically    
interpretable and the likelihood is calculated    
using appropriate error distributions for         
positive-only data.

**************************************************

According to the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) has a high potential for rapid population growth and outbreaks.

The Reef Resilience Network report states that the crown-of-thorns starfish population can increase up to 10-fold within a single generation (Reef Resilience Network, 2003). The study published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science found that their populations can rapidly increase from 0-1 individuals per hectare to more than 10-1000 individuals per hectare in a short period, causing significant changes to the benthic communities (Pratchett et al., 2022).

Additionally, the study published in Scientific Reports suggests that based on the periodicity (14-17 years) of past population cycles, a new wave of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks is expected to commence in the northern Great Barrier Reef in the near future (Hoey et al., 2023).

In summary, the crown-of-thorns starfish has a high potential for rapid population growth, with the ability to increase its numbers by up to 10-fold within a single generation and reach outbreak levels of 10-1000 individuals per hectare. This rapid population growth can have significant impacts on the coral reef ecosystems they inhabit.

To calculate the intrinsic growth rate, I'll analyze the population growth information provided.

The key information is the population increase of "up to 10-fold within a single generation". To convert this to an intrinsic growth rate (year^-1), I'll need to estimate the generation time and calculate the annual growth rate.

Assuming a generation time of approximately 1-2 years for crown-of-thorns starfish:

10-fold increase over 1-2 years translates to:
- If 1 year: ln(10) â 2.30 year^-1
- If 2 years: ln(10)/2 â 1.15 year^-1

Calculating the average:
(2.30 + 1.15) / 2 = 1.725 year^-1

Therefore, the response would be:

{"min": 1.15, "max": 2.30, "value": 1.725}

This represents the estimated intrinsic population growth rate for crown-of-thorns starfish based on the provided search results, converted to the appropriate units (year^-1).

Search results found for r_slow
**************************************************

Based on the search results, slow-growing coral species can take a long time to regenerate and expand their populations:

Slow-growing coral species, such as those found in Alaska, can take up to 60 years to reach full size (NOAA, n.d.). These slow growth rates are typical of many hard or stony coral species, which on average grow at a rate of about 10 cm per year (NOAA, n.d.). 

A study on two reef-building coral species found that their growth rates were indeed slow, with little population expansion observed over a 3-year study period (Edmunds et al., 2021). The researchers noted that the slow growth rates and limited population trajectories of these slow-growing coral species make them particularly vulnerable to disturbances and environmental changes.

In the context of a warming ocean, the slow regeneration and expansion rates of these coral species may mean they recover more slowly from events like bleaching or other impacts (NOAA, n.d.). This highlights the importance of protecting and conserving slow-growing coral habitats, as they provide critical fish habitat and other ecosystem services.

In summary, slow-growing coral species can take decades to reach full size and exhibit limited population expansion, making them vulnerable to disturbances. Conserving these slow-growing coral habitats is crucial given their slow recovery potential (NOAA, n.d.; Edmunds et al., 2021).

After carefully analyzing the search results, I cannot find a direct numerical value for the intrinsic growth rate (year^-1) of slow-growing corals. 

The search results provide some growth-related information:
- Corals can take up to 60 years to reach full size
- Average growth of about 10 cm per year
- Limited population expansion observed over 3-year periods

However, these metrics do not directly translate to an intrinsic growth rate in the units of year^-1.

Therefore, my response is:

No relevant values found

To definitively determine the intrinsic growth rate would require specialized ecological research specifically measuring population growth rates of slow-growing coral species.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, here is a summary of the key information regarding the population regeneration and expansion rate of fast-growing coral species:

Fast-growing coral species are known to have different population trajectories compared to slower-growing species. According to a study published in the PMC journal, some fast-growing coral species exhibit "low survival rates, fast growth rates and short-life expectancies but may recover rapidly from disturbances" (PMC8252767). This suggests that these fast-growing corals can regenerate and expand their populations at a faster rate than slower-growing species.

Another study found that "reef coral biodiversity experienced marked evolutionary rate shifts in the last 3 million years, possibly driven by biotic interactions" (PMC9065008). This indicates that the rapid growth and expansion of certain coral species may have shaped the overall evolution and diversity of reef corals over time.

Locally, various environmental factors can influence the calcification and growth rates of coral species, including "light intensities, sedimentation, freshwater influxes, nutrients, and pollutants" (Springer link). These factors can impact the regeneration and expansion potential of fast-growing corals in specific reef environments.

In summary, the available research suggests that fast-growing coral species have the ability to rapidly regenerate and expand their populations, potentially outcompeting slower-growing species and driving changes in overall reef coral biodiversity. However, local environmental conditions can also play a significant role in the growth and recovery rates of these fast-growing corals.

While the search results discuss fast-growing coral characteristics and their population dynamics, they do not provide a specific numerical value for the intrinsic growth rate (year^-1). The text describes qualitative characteristics like "fast growth rates" and "rapid regeneration", but does not quantify the growth rate numerically.

To obtain the specific intrinsic growth rate, I would recommend consulting specialized marine biology or coral ecology research papers that directly measure coral population growth rates.

Based on the search results, the maximum sustainable coral reef ecosystem coverage percentage is estimated to be around 50-70% globally.

According to the study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, "Overall, historical coral coverage was estimated to range from 58% to 70% in coral reef systems worldwide. There has been approximately a 50% decline in coral cover over the past few decades" (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2021).

The UNEP visual feature on the status of coral reefs of the world also notes that "Coral reefs occupy less than 1 per cent of the ocean floor â¦ yet they are home to more than 25 per cent of marine life" (UNEP, n.d.). This suggests that coral reefs, despite their relatively small spatial coverage, play a disproportionately important role in supporting marine biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The NOAA feature story on coral reefs benefiting from reduced land-sea impacts under ocean warming indicates that "to our surprise, we found that coral cover was unchanged at nearly 20 percent of the reefs in our study. Reefs with the highest cover of live coral were those that had the lowest levels of land-based pollution and sedimentation" (NOAA, 2022). This suggests that with proper management and reduction of land-based impacts, coral reef ecosystems can maintain coverage up to around 20% or potentially higher.

In summary, the available evidence suggests that the maximum sustainable coral reef ecosystem coverage percentage is likely in the range of 50-70% globally, with the potential for higher coverage in well-managed reef systems that are protected from land-based impacts.

Based on the search results, the optimal sea temperature for crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris) survival appears to be around 28-29Â°C.

The first search result indicates that sea surface temperatures at the collection locations for crown-of-thorns starfish generally range from 24Â°C to 29Â°C annually (AIMS 2021a). This suggests that the starfish can survive and thrive within this temperature range.

The second search result provides more specific information, stating that 32Â°C is above the thermal optimum for crown-of-thorns starfish, indicating that prolonged exposure to temperatures higher than 32Â°C can negatively impact their performance and survival (Uthicke et al. 2022).

The third search result further supports the optimal temperature range, stating that larval development in Acanthaster planci (a closely related species) is optimal at temperatures of about 28Â°C (Johnson and Babcock 1994).

In summary, the available evidence suggests that the optimal sea temperature for crown-of-thorns starfish survival is around 28-29Â°C, with temperatures above 32Â°C being detrimental to their performance and survival.

Asking claude
Based on the search results, I'll extract the temperature values for crown-of-thorns starfish:

Optimal temperatures found:
- 28-29Â°C (first and third search results)
- 32Â°C mentioned as above thermal optimum (second search result)

Calculating the values:
- Minimum: 28
- Maximum: 29
- Average (value): 28.5

Therefore, the response in the requested JSON format is:

{"min": 28, "max": 29, "value": 28.5}

The values are already in Celsius, which matches the expected units, so no conversion is necessary.
Found values for temp_opt: {'min': 28.0, 'max': 29.0, 'value': 28.5}
