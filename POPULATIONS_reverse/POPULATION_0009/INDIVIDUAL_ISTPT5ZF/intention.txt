This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks:

1. COTS population density (individuals/mÂ²)
2. Slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites spp.) (%)
3. Fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp.) (%)

Key ecological processes include:
- Temperature-dependent COTS reproduction and mortality
- COTS immigration from external sources
- Preferential feeding of COTS on fast-growing corals
- Different growth rates between coral types
- Density-dependent coral growth and space competition
