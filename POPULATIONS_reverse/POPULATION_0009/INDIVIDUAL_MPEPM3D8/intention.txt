This model describes the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks:

1. COTS population density (individuals/mÂ²)
2. Slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites) (%)
3. Fast-growing coral cover (Acropora) (%)

Key ecological processes:
- COTS population growth depends on available coral food sources
- COTS preferentially feed on fast-growing Acropora
- Coral growth is temperature-dependent
- COTS recruitment includes both local reproduction and external immigration
- Coral mortality is driven by COTS predation and environmental factors

The model uses time series data from 1980-2005 including:
- COTS abundance
- Coral cover (both types)
- Sea surface temperature
- COTS immigration rates
