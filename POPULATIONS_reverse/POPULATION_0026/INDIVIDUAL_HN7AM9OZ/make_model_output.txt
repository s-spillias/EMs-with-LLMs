You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

Alright, I need to address the user's request to create a TMB model for modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. The user provided detailed instructions and
some data files, but they also mentioned that two C++ files are empty, so I'll focus on creating new content for those.                                                                                      

First, I'll start by understanding the ecological processes involved. The model needs to capture boom-bust cycles of COTS, their predation on corals, and the environmental factors influencing these        
dynamics. I should include mechanisms like resource limitation, functional responses, and feedback loops.                                                                                                    

Next, considering numerical stability is crucial. I'll use small constants to avoid division by zero and smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs. Parameters should be bounded using smooth penalties to  
keep them biologically meaningful.                                                                                                                                                                           

For the likelihood calculation, I need to ensure all observations are included. Using lognormal distributions for strictly positive data makes sense here. I'll also make sure to use fixed minimum standard 
deviations to prevent numerical issues.                                                                                                                                                                      

Now, structuring the model in C++. I'll define parameters with appropriate units and initial values. The model will have states for coral cover (slow and fast growing) and COTS abundance. The intention.txt
should concisely summarize the model's purpose and structure.                                                                                                                                                

In model.cpp, I'll set up the model with time steps, defining functions for COTS growth, coral predation, recruitment, and natural mortality. Each equation will be described to ensure clarity. I'll make   
sure to use previous time step values to avoid data leakage.                                                                                                                                                 

For parameters.json, I'll create an array of parameter objects, each specifying their name, value, description, source, type, and priority. This ensures that the model is well-documented and the parameters
are optimized in a logical order.                                                                                                                                                                            

Finally, I'll test the model structure in my mind, ensuring all components interact correctly and that the equations make biological sense. I'll also check that the parameters are reasonable based on the  
provided data and ecological knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                      


I'll help create the model step by step. First, let's create the intention.txt file to outline the model's purpose and structure.

 4 Adds recruitment stochasticity through the beta_size parameter                                                                                                                                            
 5 Uses lognormal likelihood calculation for positive-valued data                                                                                                                                            
 6 Maintains biological realism with smooth transitions and bounded parameters                                                                                                                               

The model follows a process-based approach to simulate:

 • Recruitment processes

Would you like me to explain any part of the model in more detail?
