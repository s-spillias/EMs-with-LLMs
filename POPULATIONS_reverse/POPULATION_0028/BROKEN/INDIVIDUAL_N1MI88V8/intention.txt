COTS Population Dynamics Model
This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. The primary focus is on:

1. Simulating boom-bust population cycles of COTS
2. Capturing selective predation patterns on slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals
3. Incorporating environmental influences from sea surface temperature
4. Modeling recruitment processes from larval immigration
5. Including feedback mechanisms between coral prey and starfish populations

Key ecological components:
- Coral growth dynamics with species-specific parameters
- COTS predation rates varying by coral type
- Temperature-dependent mortality rates
- Recruitment limitation through larval supply
- Population regulation via density dependence

The model aims to replicate the observed patterns in the data while maintaining biological realism and numerical stability.
