COTS Outbreak Model Intention
This model aims to simulate episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. Key components include:

1. Population dynamics of adult COTS, incorporating:
   - Recruitment from larvae
   - Density-dependent mortality
   - Boom-bust cycle behavior

2. Coral community dynamics:
   - Growth of slow-growing Faviidae and Porites corals
   - Growth of fast-growing Acropora corals
   - Differential susceptibility to COTS predation

3. Environmental influences:
   - Sea Surface Temperature (SST) effects on COTS recruitment
   - Larval immigration rates
   - Potential indirect effects from coral condition

4. Trophic interactions:
   - Functional response of COTS feeding on corals
   - Altered prey availability feedbacks
   - Selective predation patterns

The model uses a mechanistic approach with parameterized functions for population growth, predation, and environmental influence while maintaining numerical stability through bounded parameters and smooth transitions.
