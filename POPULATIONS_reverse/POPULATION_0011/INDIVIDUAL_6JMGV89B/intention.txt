Current fit analysis:
Residuals indicate that the model tends to underestimate saturation effects when coral cover is high, leading to systematic bias in COTS population predictions.

Improvement:
- Introduced a new parameter, alpha_coral, into the COTS growth equation to scale the impact of the aggregated coral cover (slow + fast) on limiting COTS growth.
- This refinement provides a more realistic representation of resource limitations, effectively adjusting the carrying capacity in response to available coral cover.
- The adjustment is expected to reduce biases observed in the residuals and improve the overall predictive performance of the model.
