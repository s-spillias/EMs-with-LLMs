Updated model to incorporate coral-coral competition by replacing the independent logistic growth terms with a shared carrying capacity parameter (coral_capacity). This adjustment reflects resource limitation and space competition between slow and fast coral, ensuring that total coral cover does not exceed ecologically realistic bounds. The change is motivated by residual patterns showing over-prediction of coral cover when each type grew toward a fixed maximum independently.
