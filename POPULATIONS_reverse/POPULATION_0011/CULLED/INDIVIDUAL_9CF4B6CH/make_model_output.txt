Below are the changes I propose:                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

 1 In parameters.json, add a new parameter coral_capacity with a default value of 100.0. This parameter represents the maximum achievable coral cover (%) accounting for both coral types' competition.                                                       
 2 In model.cpp update the parameter declarations to include coral_capacity and change the logistic terms for both slow and fast coral dynamics. Instead of each coral type growing toward a fixed 100%, they now both “compete” for space using a shared     
   carrying capacity (coral_capacity).                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 3 In intention.txt update the model description to justify this ecological change. This new formulation should improve the model by constraining total coral cover, addressing the residuals which indicated an over-prediction when each coral grew         
   independently.

 Updated model to incorporate coral-coral competition by replacing the independent logistic growth terms with a shared carrying capacity parameter (coral_capacity). This adjustment reflects resource limitation and space competition between slow and fast 
 coral, ensuring that total coral cover does not exceed ecologically realistic bounds. The change is motivated by residual patterns showing over-prediction of coral cover when each type grew toward a fixed maximum independently.
