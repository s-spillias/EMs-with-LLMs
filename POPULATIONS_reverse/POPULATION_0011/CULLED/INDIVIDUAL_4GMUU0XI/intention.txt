The model simulates the dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. It integrates logistic growth of COTS with selective predation effects on two coral groups â€“ slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora). Ecological processes such as resource limitation via saturating functions, environmental modulation of rates, and feedback loops are incorporated. Predictions are strictly based on previous time step values to avoid data leakage, while numerical stability is maintained using small constants and smooth transitions.
