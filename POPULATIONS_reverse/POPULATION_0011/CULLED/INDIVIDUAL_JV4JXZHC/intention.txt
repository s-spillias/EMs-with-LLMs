1. This model predicts Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. It simulates COTS population growth influenced by resource limitations and selective predation on two coral communities: slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora).
3. Ecological processes include saturating functions for growth recovery, smooth thresholds to ensure numerical stability, and modifications of rates based on indirect feedback loops.
4. Observations (cots_dat, slow_dat, fast_dat) drive the likelihood calculation using lognormal error distributions with small constants for stability.
