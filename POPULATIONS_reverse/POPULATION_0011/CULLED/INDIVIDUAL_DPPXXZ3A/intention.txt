Ecological Update:
We modified the predation term in the population model to capture a saturating predation functional response. Instead of the linear effect of coral cover on predation (using a very small constant for numerical stability), we now use a Michaelisâ€“Menten formulation. The new parameter, log_K_predation, defines the coral cover at which the predation efficiency is half its maximum. This change acknowledges that predator consumption rates saturate when coral cover is high, better representing resource limitation and predator search efficiency, and is expected to improve the residuals by capturing indirect feedback mechanisms.
