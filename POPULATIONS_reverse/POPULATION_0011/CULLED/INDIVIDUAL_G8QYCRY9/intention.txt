Model Improvement:
The current model residuals indicate a systematic bias likely related to the predation formulation. 
To improve realism, a new parameter "handling_time" has been introduced, representing the handling time 
or saturation effect in the predation process. This change implements a Holling Type-II functional response 
by modifying the predation terms to include "handling_time * cots_pred(t-1)". This adjustment is expected to 
reduce over-predation at high predator densities and better capture the ecological feedbacks in coral consumption.
