This model is designed to predict the dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef with a focus on outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts on coral communities. 
It simulates three main processes:
1. The logistic growth of COTS influenced by environmental forcing (immigration and sea‐surface temperature),
2. The growth of slow-growing coral (Faviidae and Porites) regulated by logistic dynamics and reduced by saturating starfish predation,
3. The growth of fast-growing coral (Acropora) similarly affected by logistic dynamics and starfish predation.
Key ecological processes such as resource limitation, process‐specific efficiencies, smooth transition functions, and indirect feedback loops are incorporated to ensure robust, biologically realistic predictions.
