Residual analysis of the current model reveals systematic bias in the coral predictions, suggesting that the linear predation formulation does not capture saturation effects at higher coral cover. To address this, we introduce the parameter H_coral—a half-saturation constant that alters the predation loss via a Michaelis‐Menten style function. This change means that when coral cover is high, the incremental impact of increased coral on predation loss is reduced, reflecting ecological phenomena such as limited predator consumption capacity or prey switching. We expect that this adjustment will better capture the system dynamics and reduce residual bias.
