Model Improvement Rationale:
The current model residuals indicate that predation impacts on coral exhibit feedback that scales with coral density, suggesting that a constant predation efficiency is oversimplified. 
To address this, we introduce density‚Äêdependent modulation of predation efficiency. The effective efficiency is computed as:
    effective_efficiency = efficiency / (1 + mod_eff * (coral_pred[t-1] / K))
for both slow- and fast-growing corals.
This approach captures ecological mechanisms such as competitive effects and refugia, improving the fit of the model while ensuring that only past data (t-1) is used in predictions.
