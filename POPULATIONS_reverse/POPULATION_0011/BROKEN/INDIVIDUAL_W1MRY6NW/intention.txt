Our current model fit shows systematic residual patterns that hint at missing interspecific interactions. In response, the slow-growing coral dynamics have been updated to include an interspecific competition term wherein the growth rate is reduced by the presence of fast-growing coral via the new parameter, competition_slow_fast. This addition ensures that only previous time step values are used, preventing data leakage and more accurately capturing resource limitation effects. We expect this improvement to reduce residual bias and better represent the competitive balance between coral species.
