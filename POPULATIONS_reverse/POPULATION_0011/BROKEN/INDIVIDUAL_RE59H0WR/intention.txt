Current model fit indicates that residuals from coral cover predictions show a systematic bias, suggesting that resource competition may be an important missing process. The updated dynamics now incorporate interspecific competition between slow-growing and fast-growing corals by modifying the logistic growth terms. This change reduces the effective coral growth rate when both types are abundant, better capturing resource limitations and competitive interactions. The new parameters (alpha_sf, alpha_fs) have been introduced to quantify these effects.
