Ecological model update:
We have introduced an interspecific competition term where slow-growing coral reduces the growth of fast-growing coral. 
This reflects the ecological insight that these coral groups compete for limited space and nutrients.
The new parameter comp_slow_on_fast modulates this effect and helps capture residual patterns indicating competitive interactions.
All predictions continue to use only previous time step states to avoid data leakage.
