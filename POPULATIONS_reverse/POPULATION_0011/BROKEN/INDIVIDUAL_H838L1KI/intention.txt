Ecological Model Improvement:

We have incorporated a novel mechanism for competition between coral species. Specifically, the logistic growth of fast-growing coral is modified to include the competitive impact of slow-growing coral, representing the indirect resource limitation due to shared substrate. This adjustment acknowledges that when slow-growing coral is abundant, it inhibits the expansion of fast-growing coral. The new parameter "alpha_comp_fast" quantifies this competitive effect, addressing patterns observed in the residuals where fast-growing coral cover was overpredicted under high slow-growing coral conditions.
