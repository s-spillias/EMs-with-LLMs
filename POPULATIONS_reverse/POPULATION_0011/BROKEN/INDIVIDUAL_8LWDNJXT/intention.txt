This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics 
and their impacts on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae/Porites and fast-growing Acropora) on the 
Great Barrier Reef. The model incorporates multiple forms of resource limitation via saturating functions, 
process-specific efficiencies, indirect feedback loops between starfish and coral, and environmental modifiers. 
Dynamic state variables are updated using previous time step values to prevent data leakage, and likelihoods 
are calculated with lognormal error distributions incorporating fixed minimum standard deviations for numerical stability.
