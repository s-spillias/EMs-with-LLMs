Ecological Update:
Incorporated an interspecific competition term between slow- and fast-growing corals by modifying their logistic growth functions. In each equation, the effective density is now the sum of the focal coral and a fraction (alpha_comp) of its competitor, representing competition for limited substrate. This change (with new parameter alpha_comp, default value 0.05) better captures resource limitation effects observed in the residual analysis, and avoids data leakage by using only previous time step predictions.
