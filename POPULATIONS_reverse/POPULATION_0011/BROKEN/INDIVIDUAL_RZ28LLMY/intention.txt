This model update introduces competition between slow and fast-growing corals by modifying the regrowth equations. Instead of each coral type growing independently toward a maximum cover of 100%, regrowth for both is now limited by the combined coral cover (slow + fast). This reflects resource limitations and space competition, providing a more realistic ecological mechanism consistent with the residual patterns observed.
