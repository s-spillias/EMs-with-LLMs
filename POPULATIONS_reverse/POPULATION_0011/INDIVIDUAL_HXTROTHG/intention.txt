The current model residuals indicate that the discrepancies between observed and predicted coral covers may be due to missing feedbacks from spatial constraints. By introducing a competition coefficient (alpha_comp), the model now accounts for inter-coral competition for space by reducing the effective recovery rates when overall coral cover is high. This adjustment offers a more realistic representation of resource limitation and should improve model performance.
