Below are the proposed changes. We will add a new parameter, comp_eff, representing interspecific competition among coral types. We modify the coral dynamics equations in model.cpp to subtract a competition term (half of the product of slow and fast     
coral populations scaled by comp_eff, ensuring that both coral types are reduced by competition for shared resources). We also update parameters.json to include the new parameter and update intention.txt to explain the improved ecological realism        
suggested by the residuals.

 The current model residuals indicate that the independent logistic formulations for slow- and fast-growing corals may be missing important interaction terms. To improve the model’s fit, we have introduced an interspecific competition term between the t 
 coral groups. This term (scaled by the new parameter comp_eff) accounts for resource limitation and shared space constraints, representing a negative feedback mechanism that dampens growth when both coral types are abundant. This adjustment reflects    
 realistic ecological interactions and should help reduce systematic residual errors observed in coral cover predictions.

Once you apply these changes, you can then compile and run the model to assess if the additional competition term better captures the ecological dynamics suggested by the residuals.
