In this update we introduce a new parameter, log_resource_limit, to replace the fixed constant in the saturation term of COTS growth.
Previously the model assumed a fixed resource baseline of 1 for coral cover when calculating restricted growth.
Residuals indicated that the fixed constant did not adequately capture the dynamic effect of coral cover availability on COTS population growth.
By estimating a baseline resource availability (resource_limit = exp(log_resource_limit)), the model now allows for flexible saturation dynamics.
This improvement better reflects ecological realism by quantifying resource limitations and feedbacks between resource (coral cover) and consumer (COTS).
