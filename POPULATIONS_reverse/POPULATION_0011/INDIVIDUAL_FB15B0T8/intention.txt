Improved ecological dynamics: Residual analysis revealed systematic over-prediction of coral cover, suggesting missing interspecific effects. To better represent the system, a density-dependent competition term (alpha_comp) was introduced in both coral equations, representing competition for limited substrate. This update creates a mechanistic link between slow and fast-growing corals and is expected to reduce bias in coral predictions.
