You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Predicting Crown of Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts through selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species).. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

 This model predicts Crown‐of‐Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef by simulating outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts through selective predation on coral communities. In particular, the model captures:                 
 1. (Equation 1) Starfish dynamics via logistic growth augmented by external immigration (cotsimm_dat) from forcing data.                                                                                                                                     
 2. (Equation 2) Slow-growing coral (Faviidae and Porites) dynamics with logistic growth and losses due to saturating predation by starfish, modulated by sea surface temperature.                                                                            
 3. (Equation 3) Fast-growing coral (Acropora spp.) dynamics following a similar logistic–predation structure.                                                                                                                                                
 Small constants (e.g., 1e-8) are added to ensure numerical stability, while smooth functional responses and environmental modifiers (using sst_dat) prevent abrupt transitions.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) has an exceptionally high reproductive potential that can contribute to population outbreaks. 

The research indicates that individual female crown-of-thorns starfish can produce over 100 million oocytes (eggs) (Pratchett et al., 2014). This is considered the highest oocyte production ever recorded for a single starfish individual. Additionally, a review by Pratchett et al. (2017) states that crown-of-thorns starfish can release up to 100 million eggs per individual female, suggesting that outbreaks can occur even at low population densities.

The high fecundity of crown-of-thorns starfish is a key factor that contributes to their ability to undergo population explosions, which can lead to significant damage to coral reef ecosystems (Pratchett et al., 2017; Hoey et al., 2023). The exponential reproductive potential of this species allows for rapid population growth, which can quickly overwhelm coral reefs and lead to widespread coral mortality.

In summary, the crown-of-thorns starfish has an exceptionally high reproductive output, with individual females capable of producing over 100 million eggs. This exceptional fecundity is a primary driver of the species' ability to undergo population outbreaks that can devastate coral reef ecosystems (Pratchett et al., 2014, 2017; Hoey et al., 2023).

Based on the search results, the maximum sustainable population density for crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) is not clearly defined, as it can vary depending on the specific location and environmental conditions. However, the search results provide some insights into the population dynamics and management of this species:

1. Increasing densities of crown-of-thorns starfish have been observed in recent years. A study published in Nature Scientific Reports found increasing densities of crown-of-thorns starfish at Lizard Island, Australia, from 2019 to 2022 (Pratchett et al., 2023).

2. The "background" density of crown-of-thorns starfish, which is the population level that can be sustained without causing significant damage to coral reefs, is not well-established. A study published in the Proceedings of the 13th International Coral Reef Symposium suggests that the population density of crown-of-thorns starfish in dive sites in Thailand ranged from 0.01 to 0.5 individuals per square meter (Thummasan et al., 2019).

3. Control efforts, such as manual removal or targeted culling, are often used to limit the impact of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks on coral reefs. These efforts aim to reset the population to a "background" density that can be sustained without causing significant damage (Pratchett et al., 2014).

In summary, the maximum sustainable population density for crown-of-thorns starfish is not clearly defined, as it can vary depending on the specific location and environmental conditions. However, the search results suggest that population densities above 0.5 individuals per square meter may be considered unsustainable and require management intervention to limit the impact on coral reef ecosystems.

Asking claude
Based on the search results, I'll extract the population density values:

The study by Thummasan et al. (2019) reported a range of 0.01 to 0.5 individuals per square meter.

Calculation:
- Minimum: 0.01 individuals/m²
- Maximum: 0.5 individuals/m²
- Average (value): (0.01 + 0.5) / 2 = 0.255 individuals/m²

Therefore, the response in the requested JSON format is:

{"min": 0.01, "max": 0.5, "value": 0.255}

The values are already in the correct units (individuals/m²), so no conversion is necessary.

**************************************************

Based on the search results provided, the key points regarding the regeneration and expansion rate of slow-growing coral communities are:

1. Slow-growing coral species can be successfully grown and outplanted for restoration purposes, but predation events need to be reduced. A study found that if predation is minimized, massive corals can be successfully grown and transplanted for restoration (Shaver et al., 2018).

2. Coral nurseries can help grow corals much faster than in the wild, giving reefs a better chance of recovery. The low-stress environment of a nursery allows conservationists to grow corals at a faster rate compared to natural growth in the ocean (NOAA, n.d.).

3. Restoration efforts can significantly increase coral cover over time. For example, one NOAA project aims to restore coral cover from 2% to an average of 25% across multiple sites (NOAA Fisheries, n.d.).

In summary, while slow-growing coral species naturally have a slower expansion rate, techniques like microfragmenting and coral nurseries can help accelerate their growth and regeneration for successful restoration projects. Careful management of predation and other stressors is crucial for the long-term success of these efforts.

While the search results discuss coral growth and restoration techniques, they do not provide a specific numerical value for the intrinsic growth rate of slow-growing coral in year^-1 units. The results describe qualitative aspects of coral growth and restoration efforts, but do not quantify the precise growth rate parameter requested.

To obtain this specific numerical value, I would recommend consulting specialized marine biology or coral ecology research papers that focus on population dynamics and growth rates of specific coral species.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the maximum sustainable coverage for slow-growing coral reef ecosystems is a complex and challenging issue. Here is a summary of the key points:

Global coverage of living coral has declined by about 50% since the 1950s (Woodhead et al., 2019). This decline in coral cover has led to a corresponding decline in the capacity of coral reef ecosystems to provide important services, such as supporting diverse marine life and providing coastal protection (Woodhead et al., 2019).

Coral reef protected areas can be an important management strategy to help sustain coral reef ecosystems (NOAA, n.d.). A guide from the Coral Reef Foundation provides recommendations for planning and managing coral reef protected areas, including establishing clear conservation goals, monitoring ecosystem health, and engaging local stakeholders (NOAA, n.d.).

However, the maximum sustainable coverage for coral reefs is difficult to determine, as it depends on a variety of factors, including local environmental conditions, the specific species of corals present, and the level of human impacts (NOAA, n.d.). Coral reefs are highly sensitive to disturbances such as climate change, pollution, and overfishing, which can limit their ability to recover and maintain their coverage over time (Woodhead et al., 2019).

In summary, while there is no single definitive answer for the maximum sustainable coverage of slow-growing coral reef ecosystems, the available evidence suggests that maintaining and restoring coral cover is crucial for preserving the important ecological and economic services these ecosystems provide. Effective management strategies, such as establishing protected areas and addressing local and global threats, will be essential for supporting the long-term sustainability of coral reefs.

Search results found for r_fast
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the key points regarding the regeneration and expansion rate of fast-growing coral communities are:

1. Fast-growing hard (stony) corals can naturally grow at a rate of around 10 centimeters per year, which is comparable to the growth rate of human hair (NOAA Ocean Service, "Hope for Corals: Growing Species Resilience in Coral Nurseries").

2. However, there appears to be a trade-off between growth rate and regeneration capacity in branching coral species. The study found that "high growth rates seem to impair regeneration capacity" (NCBI, "Fast Growth May Impair Regeneration Capacity in the Branching Coral Pocillopora damicornis").

3. Coral restoration efforts can help increase coral cover from as low as 2% to an average of 25% across multiple sites (NOAA Fisheries, "Restoring Coral Reefs"). This suggests that while fast growth is possible, coral communities may require active restoration and management to maintain and expand their coverage.

In summary, fast-growing coral species can naturally expand at a rate of around 10 cm per year, but their regeneration capacity may be impaired by this rapid growth. Successful coral restoration efforts have been able to significantly increase coral cover, indicating the potential for expanding fast-growing coral communities through active management and intervention.

**************************************************
Asking claude
To convert the 10 cm/year growth rate to an intrinsic growth rate (year^-1), I'll need to make some assumptions about coral size and growth dynamics.

Assuming an average coral colony diameter of around 10 cm, the intrinsic growth rate would be approximately 1 (100% increase per year) or 1 year^-1.

Therefore, the response would be:

{"min": 0.5, "max": 1.5, "value": 1.0}

Key reasoning:
- The search results provide a linear growth rate of 10 cm/year
- Translating this to an intrinsic growth rate requires estimating the base size of the coral
- The value of 1 year^-1 represents a reasonable estimate of exponential population growth for a fast-growing coral species
- The range reflects some uncertainty in the precise growth dynamics

Note: This is an approximate conversion based on the limited information provided, and actual intrinsic growth rates can vary significantly between coral species and environmental conditions.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the maximum sustainable coverage for fast-growing coral reef ecosystems is a complex and challenging issue due to the various threats facing coral reefs globally.

According to NOAA Fisheries, the main threats to coral reef ecosystems include climate change, fishing impacts, and local stressors (NOAA Fisheries, n.d.). The IISD article notes that these threats are causing a sharp decline in coral reefs, with a potential loss of 70-90% of warm-water reefs by 2050 (IISD, n.d.).

To address these threats and restore coral reef ecosystems, NOAA Fisheries has outlined a strategic plan that focuses on reducing the main threats and implementing conservation and restoration efforts (NOAA Fisheries, n.d.). One example of a restoration effort is the coral reef insurance policy announced by The Nature Conservancy, which will provide funding for rapid repair and restoration of coral reefs in Hawaii following hurricane or tropical storm damage (The Nature Conservancy, n.d.).

However, the search results do not provide a specific estimate for the maximum sustainable coverage for fast-growing coral reef ecosystems. The information suggests that achieving and maintaining high levels of coral reef coverage is challenging due to the various threats facing these ecosystems. Ongoing conservation and restoration efforts, as well as addressing the root causes of coral reef decline, will be crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability of these important marine habitats.
