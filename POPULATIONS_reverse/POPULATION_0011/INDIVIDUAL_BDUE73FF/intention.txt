This model predicts Crown‐of‐Thorns starfish population dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef by simulating outbreak patterns and their ecological impacts through selective predation on coral communities. In particular, the model captures:
1. (Equation 1) Starfish dynamics via logistic growth augmented by external immigration (cotsimm_dat) from forcing data.
2. (Equation 2) Slow-growing coral (Faviidae and Porites) dynamics with logistic growth and losses due to saturating predation by starfish, modulated by sea surface temperature.
3. (Equation 3) Fast-growing coral (Acropora spp.) dynamics following a similar logistic–predation structure.
Small constants (e.g., 1e-8) are added to ensure numerical stability, while smooth functional responses and environmental modifiers (using sst_dat) prevent abrupt transitions.
