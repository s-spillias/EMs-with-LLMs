This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks:

1. COTS population density (individuals/mÂ²)
2. Slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites spp.) (%)
3. Fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp.) (%)

Key ecological processes included:
- Temperature-dependent COTS growth and mortality
- Coral-specific COTS predation rates
- Different coral growth rates
- External COTS immigration
- Density-dependent COTS mortality

The model uses annual time steps and accounts for the preference of COTS for fast-growing Acropora corals while still allowing feeding on slow-growing species when preferred prey is scarce.
