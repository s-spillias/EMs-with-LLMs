This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks three main state variables:
1. COTS adult population density (individuals/mÂ²)
2. Slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites spp.) (%)
3. Fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp.) (%)

Key ecological processes included:
- Temperature-dependent COTS recruitment
- Density-dependent COTS mortality
- Coral predation by COTS (preferential feeding on fast-growing corals)
- Temperature-dependent coral growth
- Natural coral mortality

The model uses time series data from 1980-2005 to estimate parameters and predict population dynamics.
