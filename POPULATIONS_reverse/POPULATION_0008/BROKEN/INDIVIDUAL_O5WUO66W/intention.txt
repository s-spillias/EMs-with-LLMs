This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on two coral functional groups on the Great Barrier Reef: slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals. The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS population growth and mortality
2. Immigration pulses of COTS that can trigger outbreaks
3. Differential feeding preferences of COTS between fast and slow-growing corals
4. Coral growth and recovery dynamics
5. Environmental effects on coral mortality (e.g., temperature stress)

The model uses annual time steps and incorporates both density-dependent and environmental factors affecting population dynamics. Data fitting is done using appropriate error structures (lognormal for populations) with careful attention to numerical stability.
