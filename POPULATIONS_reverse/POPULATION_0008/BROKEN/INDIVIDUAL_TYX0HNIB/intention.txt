This model describes the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population dynamics influenced by:
   - Natural mortality and reproduction
   - Temperature effects on survival
   - Immigration of COTS larvae
   
2. Coral dynamics for two functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)
   
3. Key ecological processes:
   - Temperature-dependent COTS survival
   - Preferential feeding of COTS on fast-growing corals
   - Coral growth and recovery
   - Immigration pulses of COTS

The model uses time series data from 1980-2005 including COTS abundance, coral cover percentages, sea surface temperature, and COTS immigration rates.
