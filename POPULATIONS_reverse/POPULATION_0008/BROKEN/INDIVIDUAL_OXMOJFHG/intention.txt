This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) and their impacts on two coral functional groups on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population growth influenced by:
   - Temperature-dependent reproduction
   - Immigration of larvae
   - Density-dependent mortality

2. Two coral functional groups:
   - Slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing (Acropora species)

3. Key ecological processes:
   - Temperature effects on COTS reproduction
   - COTS predation preferences between coral types
   - Coral growth and recovery dynamics
   - Environmental stress impacts on coral mortality

The model aims to capture the cyclic nature of COTS outbreaks and their differential impacts on coral communities, accounting for varying recovery rates between coral functional groups.
