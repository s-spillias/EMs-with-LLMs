This model describes the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population dynamics influenced by:
   - Temperature-dependent reproduction
   - Density-dependent mortality
   - External immigration of juveniles

2. Coral dynamics for two functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora)
   
3. Key ecological processes:
   - Temperature-dependent COTS reproduction
   - Preferential feeding of COTS on fast-growing corals
   - Coral growth and recovery
   - Immigration events of juvenile COTS

The model uses time series data from 1980-2005 including COTS abundance, coral cover percentages, sea surface temperature, and COTS immigration rates.
