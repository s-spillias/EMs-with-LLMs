This model describes the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks COTS abundance and two coral functional groups: slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals.

Key ecological processes:
1. COTS population grows through reproduction and immigration
2. COTS feed preferentially on corals, with different feeding rates on fast vs slow-growing species
3. Corals grow logistically and are reduced by COTS predation
4. Temperature affects COTS reproduction and coral growth
5. System includes density-dependent feedback through coral availability

The model uses time series data of COTS abundance, coral cover percentages, sea surface temperature, and COTS immigration rates from 1980-2005.
