This model describes the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks:

1. COTS population dynamics influenced by:
   - Immigration of juvenile COTS
   - Temperature-dependent survival and growth
   - Density-dependent mortality

2. Two coral functional groups:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)

3. Key ecological processes:
   - Temperature-dependent COTS survival
   - Preferential feeding of COTS on fast-growing corals
   - Coral growth and recovery
   - Competition between coral groups

The model aims to capture the cyclic nature of COTS outbreaks and their differential impacts on coral communities, considering environmental forcing through sea surface temperature.
