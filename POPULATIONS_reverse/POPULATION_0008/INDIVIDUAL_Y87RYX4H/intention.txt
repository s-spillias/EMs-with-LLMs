This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks three main state variables:
1. COTS adult population density (individuals/mÂ²)
2. Slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites species, %)
3. Fast-growing coral cover (Acropora species, %)

Key ecological processes include:
- Temperature-dependent COTS recruitment
- Density-dependent COTS mortality
- Coral-specific COTS predation rates
- Temperature-dependent coral growth
- Different recovery rates for slow vs fast-growing corals

The model accounts for both direct effects (COTS predation on corals) and environmental factors (sea surface temperature impacts on both COTS and coral dynamics).
