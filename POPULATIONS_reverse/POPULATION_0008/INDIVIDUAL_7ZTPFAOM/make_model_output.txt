I'll help create the TMB model for the Crown of   
Thorns (COTS) starfish system. Let's start with   
creating all three files:

 =======                                          
 This model describes the population dynamics of  
 Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact 
 on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef.  
 The model captures:                              
                                                  
 1. COTS population growth and mortality          
 2. Differential feeding preferences on two coral 
 types:                                           
    - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites   
 species)                                         
    - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)      
 3. Temperature effects on COTS reproduction      
 4. Immigration of COTS from external sources     
 5. Coral growth and recovery processes           
                                                  
 The model uses annual time steps and accounts fo 
 density-dependent feeding behavior of COTS on    
 corals. Temperature stress and COTS immigration  
 are included as external forcing factors.

This TMB model implements a coupled system of COTS
and coral dynamics with the following key         
features:                                         

 1 Temperature-dependent COTS reproduction        
 2 External COTS immigration                      
 3 Density-dependent growth for both COTS and     
   corals                                         
 4 Differential feeding rates on slow and         
   fast-growing corals                            
 5 Lognormal observation error structure          
 6 Numerical stability features including:        
    • Small constant (eps) to prevent division by 
      zero                                        
    • Log-transformation for strictly positive    
      values                                      
    • Smooth temperature response function        
    • Smooth transition in feeding rates          

The model uses real data from the Great Barrier   
Reef (provided in the CSV files) and includes all 
necessary parameters for calibration.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the key points regarding the population growth rate dynamics of the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) are:

1. Crown-of-thorns starfish populations have been on the rise globally since the 1970s, with outbreaks occurring in over 30 locations from the Red Sea to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) (New Heaven Reef Conservation Program).

2. On the GBR, there have been four distinct waves of crown-of-thorns starfish population irruptions documented since the 1960s, with their initiation and spread influenced by various factors (Increasing densities of Pacific crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) on the Great Barrier Reef).

3. Researchers have developed models to project crown-of-thorns starfish population dynamics, incorporating factors such as zone-specific mortality rates to account for differences in predation (Advancing projections of crown-of-thorns starfish to support management on the Great Barrier Reef).

In summary, the crown-of-thorns starfish has experienced a global increase in population since the 1970s, with recurring outbreaks on the GBR driven by complex factors. Researchers are working to improve models and projections to support management efforts in addressing this issue. The key citations for these findings are:

Search results found for r_slow
**************************************************

Based on the search results, slow-growing coral species have the potential for regeneration and expansion, but their recovery may be slower compared to faster-growing coral species.

The key findings from the search results are:

1. A study on Alaskan coral species revealed that one species can take up to 60 years to grow to full size, and this growth rate may be even slower in a warming ocean (NOAA, n.d.).

2. Research on microfragmenting, a coral restoration technique, suggests that if predation events are reduced, massive, slow-growing corals can be successfully grown and outplanted for restoration purposes (Ladd et al., 2018).

3. A study on the sexual propagation and transplantation of two slow-growing, stress-tolerant coral species found that they can be successfully propagated and transplanted as part of reef restoration efforts (Baria-Rodriguez et al., 2023).

These findings indicate that slow-growing coral species have the potential for regeneration and expansion, but their recovery may be slower compared to faster-growing species, especially in the face of environmental stressors like ocean warming. Techniques like microfragmenting and sexual propagation can be used to support the restoration of these slow-growing coral species, but their long-term success may depend on reducing predation and other threats.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the key points regarding fast-growing coral species recovery and colonization rate are:

1. Fast-growing coral species play a significant role in shaping the evolution of reef corals. A study published in Nature found that reef coral biodiversity experienced marked evolutionary rate shifts in the last 3 million years, possibly driven by biotic interactions with fast-growing species (Nature, 2022).

2. Climate change is putting the brakes on fast-growing coral species. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), table corals are fast-growing but also the first to be susceptible to bleaching and storm damage due to climate change (AIMS, n.d.).

3. Coral nurseries offer hope for growing fast-growing coral species. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that the fastest growing hard corals (or stony corals) can grow naturally at about the same rate as human hair, around 10 centimeters per year. Coral nurseries can help cultivate and restore these fast-growing species (NOAA, n.d.).

In summary, fast-growing coral species play a crucial role in shaping reef ecosystems, but they are also the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Coral nurseries offer a promising approach to cultivate and restore these fast-growing species, which could help support the recovery and colonization of coral reefs.

**************************************************
Asking claude
Based on the search results, I found a specific growth rate for fast-growing hard corals:

10 centimeters per year needs to be converted to year^-1.

Conversion:
10 cm/year = 0.1 m/year
Growth rate in year^-1 = 0.1

Therefore, the JSON response would be:

{"min": 0.1, "max": 0.1, "value": 0.1}

The single value of 0.1 year^-1 represents the growth rate of fast-growing hard corals according to the NOAA source in the search results.

Attempt 3 for K_slow: Maximum sustainable coverage for slow-growing coral species
Search results found for K_slow
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the maximum sustainable coverage for slow-growing coral species is generally around 25-30% coral cover.

The first result from NOAA states that "In general, 25 percent coral cover is considered necessary to support a healthy ecosystem and protect reef structure." This suggests that 25% coral cover is a target for healthy coral reef ecosystems.

The second result from a scientific study evaluating coral restoration efforts found that the fast-growing Acropora coral species achieved an average cover of 30.24 ± 16.17 cm2, which was more than twice the cover achieved by the slower-growing Porites and Merulina coral species (Evaluation of the performance and cost-effectiveness of coral restoration, Bayraktarov et al. 2022).

The third result discusses the potential for sustainable coral harvesting, noting that "With appropriate management, sustainable coral harvesting is possible" in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly for ornamental corals like Acroporids (Can Corals Be Harvested Sustainably?, Shafir et al. 2003).

In summary, the search results suggest that a sustainable coverage target for slow-growing coral species is generally around 25-30% coral cover, based on the need to support a healthy ecosystem and the performance of slower-growing coral species in restoration efforts. Appropriate management is key to ensuring the sustainability of any coral harvesting.

**************************************************
Asking claude
Based on the search results, I'll extract the numerical values for carrying capacity of slow-growing corals:

The results consistently mention 25-30% as the target or sustainable coral cover for slow-growing coral species.

Calculation:
- Minimum: 25%
- Maximum: 30%
- Average (value): (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5%

Therefore, the response in the requested JSON format is:

{"min": 25, "max": 30, "value": 27.5}

The values are already in the percentage (%) format, which matches the expected units, so no conversion is necessary.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the maximum sustainable coverage for fast-growing coral species can be summarized as follows:

Reef-building corals generally grow best at depths shallower than 70 meters (NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program). However, it is possible to find coral reefs at depths exceeding 91 meters (NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program).

Restoration efforts have aimed to restore coral cover from 2% to an average of 25% across multiple sites (NOAA Fisheries). This suggests that a sustainable coverage target for fast-growing coral species could be around 25% or higher, depending on the specific environmental conditions.

The research article "Corals at the edge of environmental limits: A new conceptual framework" proposes that marginal and extreme coral communities are related but distinct, and provides a framework for redefining them (Corals at the edge of environmental limits: A new conceptual framework). This suggests that the maximum sustainable coverage may vary depending on the environmental conditions and the specific coral species being considered.

In summary, the maximum sustainable coverage for fast-growing coral species can range from around 25% to potentially higher, depending on factors such as depth, environmental conditions, and the specific coral species. Careful consideration of the local environmental context is necessary to determine the appropriate sustainable coverage targets for a given coral reef ecosystem.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the optimal sea temperature for Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) reproduction appears to be around 28-29°C.

The first study found that "Temperature affects the reproductive outputs of coral-eating starfish Acanthaster spp. after adult exposure to near-future ocean warming and acidification" (Uthicke et al., 2021). This suggests that higher temperatures, in the range of "near-future ocean warming", can impact the reproductive outputs of Crown-of-thorns starfish.

The second study noted that "Sea surface temperatures at the collection locations generally range from 24 °C to 29 °C annually" (Pratchett et al., 2022), indicating that the natural temperature range for these starfish is within this 24-29°C range.

The third study found that "Peak spawning occurred one month after the 28 °C threshold was exceeded" (Pratchett et al., 2017). This suggests that 28°C appears to be a key temperature threshold for triggering peak spawning in Crown-of-thorns starfish.

In summary, the available evidence indicates that the optimal sea temperature for Crown-of-thorns starfish reproduction is around 28-29°C, with peak spawning occurring shortly after the 28°C threshold is exceeded (Uthicke et al., 2021; Pratchett et al., 2022, 2017).

Asking claude
Based on the search results, I'll extract the temperature values for Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) reproduction:

Identified temperatures:
- 24°C (lower range)
- 28°C (threshold for peak spawning)
- 29°C (upper range of optimal reproduction)

Calculating the values:
- Min: 24
- Max: 29
- Value (average): (24 + 28 + 29) / 3 = 27

Therefore, the response in the requested JSON format is:

{"min": 24, "max": 29, "value": 27}

The values are already in Celsius, which matches the expected units, so no conversion is necessary.
Found values for temp_opt: {'min': 24.0, 'max': 29.0, 'value': 27.0}
