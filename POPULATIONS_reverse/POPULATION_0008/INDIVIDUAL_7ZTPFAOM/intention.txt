This model describes the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population growth and mortality
2. Differential feeding preferences on two coral types:
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites species)
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora species)
3. Temperature effects on COTS reproduction
4. Immigration of COTS from external sources
5. Coral growth and recovery processes

The model uses annual time steps and accounts for density-dependent feeding behavior of COTS on corals. Temperature stress and COTS immigration are included as external forcing factors.
