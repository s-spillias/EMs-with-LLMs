This model describes the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model tracks three main state variables:

1. COTS population density (individuals/mÂ²)
2. Slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites) (%)
3. Fast-growing coral cover (Acropora) (%)

Key ecological processes included:
- Temperature-dependent COTS population growth
- COTS predation on both coral types with preference for fast-growing species
- Natural coral growth and mortality
- Immigration of COTS from external sources
- Density-dependent COTS mortality

The model uses time series data from 1980-2005 including:
- COTS abundance
- Coral cover for both growth forms
- Sea surface temperature
- COTS immigration rates
