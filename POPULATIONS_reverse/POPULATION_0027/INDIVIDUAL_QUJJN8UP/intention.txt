COTS Population Model Intention
This model aims to simulate episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. Key components include:
1. Coral population dynamics (fast and slow growing species)
2. COTS predation patterns and population cycles
3. Environmental influences like sea surface temperature
4. Feedback mechanisms between coral cover and COTS populations
The model focuses on replicating observed boom-bust cycles while incorporating biological realism in species interactions.
