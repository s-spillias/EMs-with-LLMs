COTS Outbreak Model Intention
This model aims to simulate episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. The primary focus is on:

1. Population dynamics of COTS, including their intrinsic growth rate and factors limiting their abundance
2. Selective predation patterns on slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora) corals
3. Mechanisms triggering outbreaks, including:
   - Environmental conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature)
   - Resource availability (coral cover dynamics)
4. Feedback loops between COTS populations and coral community shifts
5.boom-bust cycle characteristics: rapid population growth followed by declines

Key ecological processes modeled:
- Saturating functional responses for predation
- Coral growth rates modified by competition and herbivory
- Temperature-dependent mortality and reproduction rates
- Indirect effects of coral cover changes on COTS survival
