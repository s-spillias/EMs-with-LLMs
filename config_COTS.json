    "project_topic": "Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.",
