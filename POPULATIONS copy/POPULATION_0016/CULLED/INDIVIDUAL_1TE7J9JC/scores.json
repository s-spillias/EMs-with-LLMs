  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, a Holling type\u2011III grazing (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) that is algebraically equivalent to TRUTH's grazing, and nutrient mixing/entrainment identical in form to TRUTH. Phytoplankton growth is driven by the same uptake term (but candidate omits TRUTH's additional light/self\u2011shading factor a/(b + c*P)). Phytoplankton mortality is represented by both linear and quadratic terms (an alternate closure compared with TRUTH's purely linear losses), and zooplankton mortality is quadratic in the candidate (alternate vs TRUTH's linear q*Z). The candidate also returns grazing losses to nutrients via explicit unassimilated grazing, excretion and an explicit remineralization term for dead organic matter\u2014these recycling pathways are present in both models in concept but implemented differently here. Nutrient mixing matches TRUTH exactly; mixing for P and Z is not present in the candidate (so physical loss for P and Z is missing).",
