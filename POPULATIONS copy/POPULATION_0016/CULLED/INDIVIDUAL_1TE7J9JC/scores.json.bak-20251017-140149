  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure and includes all three state variables (N, P, Z) and core fluxes (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing, recycling, and mixing). Many processes are present but parameterized differently from the TRUTH Python model. Uptake in the candidate is a Michaelis\u2013Menten (nutrient-saturating) formulation without the explicit light limitation present in TRUTH. Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type III (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) and is structurally equivalent to TRUTH. Recycling is present but split among unassimilated grazing, excretion, and an explicit remineralization of dead organic matter (epsilon), which is a different closure than the TRUTH model's use of r and beta/lambda terms. The candidate also adds quadratic mortality terms (both for P and Z) and represents zooplankton excretion differently from the TRUTH parametrization. Mixing of nutrients (N0 - N) is implemented equivalently; however, an explicit phytoplankton mixing loss term that exists in TRUTH is absent in the candidate. Overall, the candidate is ecologically plausible and matches many canonical elements, but several parameterizations are alternate and a few extra processes are introduced.",
