  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake by P, grazing by Z, recycling and mortalities) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH model in multiple places. Nutrient uptake is a Michaelis\u2013Menten function of N multiplied by P (no explicit P-saturation/light limitation term present in TRUTH). Grazing/growth terms are Holling-type II (P/(K_P+P)) in the candidate while the TRUTH uses a sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) formulation. Recycling is represented by simple linear excretion/mortality returns (and explicit quadratic mortalities) rather than the TRUTH's grazing-linked recycling terms and explicit mixing term. Important absences: the candidate does not include an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for N or P (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P in TRUTH). The candidate also adds quadratic (density-dependent) mortality for both P and Z (mu_P_quad, mu_Z_quad), which are not present in TRUTH.",
