  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N, P, Z) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are modeled as simple Michaelis\u2013Menten on N (no explicit light limitation), grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a Type III-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) in TRUTH, and zooplankton growth uses an assimilation fraction on grazed biomass. The candidate adds an explicit quadratic phytoplankton mortality term and a distinct zooplankton excretion term. Crucially, the candidate omits the environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) in N and (s+k)*P in P). The candidate also uses a forward Euler integrator and log-normal observation likelihood (modeling/implementation differences), which are not ecological processes but affect behavior.",

      "explanation": "Candidate uses: \"Type p_uptake = V_max * (N_prev / (K_N + N_prev + epsilon_div)) * P_prev;\" which is Michaelis-Menten on N times P. TRUTH uses a more complex product of nutrient and light limitation: \"(N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P\". Functional family (Michaelis-Menten on N) matches but TRUTH includes an additional light limitation factor, so this is an alternate form."
