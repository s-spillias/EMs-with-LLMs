  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the main NPZ processes (nutrient uptake by P, grazing by Z, recycling, P and Z mortality, and assimilation) but uses different mathematical choices vs the TRUTH model. Uptake is simple Michaelis\u2013Menten multiplied by P (no explicit light limitation term present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling type II (candidate) vs a Holling-type III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) in TRUTH. Phytoplankton mortality is quadratic here (m_P * P^2) vs linear losses in TRUTH. The candidate omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms for N, P, and Z (TRUTH has k*(N0-N) and mixing-related losses on P), and instead includes an explicit zooplankton excretion term (epsilon * Z) that returns to N \u2014 a process not present in the TRUTH equations. Zooplankton linear mortality is the one component that is structurally equivalent to TRUTH. Numerical integration (forward Euler) and the observation/error model are implementation choices but not ecological processes.",
