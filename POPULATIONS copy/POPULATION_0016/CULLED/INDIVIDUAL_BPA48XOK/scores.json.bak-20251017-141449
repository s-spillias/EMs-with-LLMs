  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling from mortality and unassimilated grazing), but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH model in several key places. Uptake in the candidate is a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten (V_max*N/(K_N+N))*P, whereas TRUTH uses a product of nutrient saturation and a separate light/self-shading factor (N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c*P))*P. Grazing is Holling Type II (I_max*P/(K_P+P)*Z) in the candidate vs a sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z in TRUTH. The candidate omits the explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0 - N)) and the phytoplankton mixing term present in TRUTH. Candidate adds a quadratic zooplankton mortality (m_Z2*Z^2) that is not in TRUTH. Overall: same ecological roles but several alternate functional choices and one extra density-dependent zooplankton mortality process.",
