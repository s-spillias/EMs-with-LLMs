Model Assessment:
The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) formulation. While it captures the fundamental interactions, it simplifies mortality processes by using only linear terms. Specifically, the zooplankton mortality rate is constant per capita, which does not account for density-dependent effects that are common in real ecosystems. This can lead to unstable population dynamics, particularly unrealistic growth of the zooplankton population.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
Introduce quadratic mortality for zooplankton to represent density-dependent population control.

Reasoning and Justification:
The zooplankton mortality term will be updated from `m_Z * Z` to `m_Z * Z + m_Z2 * Z^2`.

1.  Ecological Realism: The new quadratic term (`m_Z2 * Z^2`) introduces a density-dependent loss mechanism. This is ecologically justified as it can represent several real-world processes, such as increased predation from higher trophic levels that are attracted to abundant zooplankton, or increased intra-specific competition for resources.

2.  Model Stability: This modification acts as a stabilizing feedback mechanism. As the zooplankton population (`Z`) increases, its overall mortality rate increases faster than its population size, which helps to prevent runaway population growth and can lead to more stable and realistic predator-prey oscillations.

3.  Implementation: This change requires adding one new parameter, `m_Z2` (the quadratic mortality rate). The biomass lost through this new pathway is assumed to be removed from the system (e.g., consumed by un-modeled predators) and is therefore not remineralized back into the nutrient pool, which is a common and reasonable assumption for this type of term.
