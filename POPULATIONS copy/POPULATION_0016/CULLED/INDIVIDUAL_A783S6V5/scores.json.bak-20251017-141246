  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, a Holling type III grazing function, assimilation to zooplankton, and multiple mortality/recycling pathways. Many elements correspond to TRUTH but some are implemented as common alternates: uptake lacks the TRUTH light/P\u2011dependence multiplicative factor, mixing/entrainment of nutrients is missing, and zooplankton mortality and phytoplankton mortality include quadratic terms instead of strictly linear losses. The candidate also adds an explicit detritus pool with remineralization and sinking, which is not present in the TRUTH model.",
