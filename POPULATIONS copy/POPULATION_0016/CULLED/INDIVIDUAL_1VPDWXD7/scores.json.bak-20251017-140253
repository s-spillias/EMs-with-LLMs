  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) but with several structural differences versus the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten term (no P-dependent light/inhibition factor present in TRUTH). Grazing is the same Holling type\u2011III (P^2/(K^2+P^2) * Z) functional form as TRUTH and assimilation into Z is handled equivalently. Recycling back to nutrients is present (unassimilated grazing, excretion, and an explicit remineralization of dead biomass) but parameterized differently. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for N and P that exists in TRUTH, and uses quadratic zooplankton mortality rather than the TRUTH linear loss. The candidate also introduces an explicit remineralization parameter acting on mortalities (epsilon), a modeling choice not present in TRUTH.",
