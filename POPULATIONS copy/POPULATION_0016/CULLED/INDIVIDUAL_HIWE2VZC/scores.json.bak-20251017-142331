  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure and most canonical processes from the TRUTH model, but with some systematic differences in functional forms and partitioning of recycling. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as classical Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake (multiplied by P) rather than the TRUTH's two-factor form that multiplies N-limitation by a P-dependent light/attenuation factor (a/(b + c*P)). Grazing is Holling type-III in both models (structurally the same). Recycling to nutrients in the candidate is split into explicit unassimilated grazing, continuous excretion, and a separate remineralization term of dead organic matter (epsilon * (p_mortality + z_mortality)), which differs from the TRUTH partitioning. Physical mixing of nutrients (delta*(N0 - N)) and washout of P (delta*P) are present and correspond to TRUTH mixing terms, but the candidate also applies washout to Z (delta*Z) and uses quadratic mortality forms for P and Z (additional compared to TRUTH's primarily linear zooplankton mortality and linear phytoplankton mortality). Overall: strong overlap with canonical processes, exact matches for grazing and many mass-balance structures, but alternates and extra processes (quadratic mortalities, explicit remineralization, Z washout) are introduced.",
