Model Assessment:
The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) formulation, which provides a good baseline for simulating plankton dynamics. It includes essential processes like nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and grazing by zooplankton.

However, a key simplification is the linear mortality term for zooplankton (mu_Z * Z). This implies a constant per-capita death rate, which is ecologically unrealistic at high population densities. In nature, a large zooplankton population would experience increased predation pressure from higher trophic levels (e.g., fish) and potentially other density-dependent effects like disease. This lack of a stabilizing feedback mechanism can lead to population instability and a poor fit to observational data, particularly by over-predicting the peaks of zooplankton blooms.

Chosen Improvement:
I will introduce a quadratic mortality term for zooplankton to represent density-dependent mortality. This is a higher-order mathematical representation that acts as a negative feedback mechanism.

The zooplankton mortality formulation will be updated as follows:
- From: Mortality = mu_Z * Z
- To: Mortality = mu_Z * Z + mu_Z_quad * Z^2

Ecological Justification:
The new quadratic term (mu_Z_quad * Z^2) causes the per-capita mortality rate of zooplankton to increase as their population density (Z) grows. This effectively models the response of predators from higher trophic levels, which would consume more zooplankton when they are abundant. This change will help to stabilize the zooplankton population, prevent unrealistic growth, and improve the overall realism and fit of the model.

The biomass lost via this new quadratic mortality pathway is assumed to be removed from the system (e.g., consumed by fish) and is NOT remineralized back into the nutrient pool (N). The existing linear mortality term (mu_Z * Z) continues to represent natural death, with the resulting biomass being remineralized.
