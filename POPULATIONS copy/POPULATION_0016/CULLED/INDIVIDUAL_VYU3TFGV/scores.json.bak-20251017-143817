  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but uses simpler, canonical functional forms than the TRUTH model. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten (N/(K+N)) nutrient limitation multiplied by P (common in the literature) rather than the TRUTH model's mixed N-limit times an additional P-dependent light term a/(b + c P). Grazing is Holling type II (saturating P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form. Recycling is present via linear mortality and excretion terms but lacks the TRUTH model's explicit mixing (entrainment/dilution) of nutrients; the candidate also adds an explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality term (mu_Z_quad * Z^2) that does not appear in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches canonical ecological roles (uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) but differs in functional details and omits environmental mixing of nutrients and phytoplankton.",
