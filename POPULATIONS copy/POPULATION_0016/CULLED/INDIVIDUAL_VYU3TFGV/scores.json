  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but differs in several mechanistic details from the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake in the candidate is a classical Michaelis-Menten N-limitation (no explicit light/self-shading limitation present in TRUTH). Recycling is present via linear mortality and excretion terms, but the candidate lacks the TRUTH model's P-dependent recycling term. Mixing/entrainment of nutrients (the k*(N0 - N) term in TRUTH) is missing. Grazing in the candidate is a Holling Type II (saturating) functional response with assimilation into Z, whereas TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2)-style grazing/predation term. The candidate adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term that is not in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches many ecological roles but uses alternate mathematical families for uptake, grazing and recycling and omits some TRUTH mixing terms.",
