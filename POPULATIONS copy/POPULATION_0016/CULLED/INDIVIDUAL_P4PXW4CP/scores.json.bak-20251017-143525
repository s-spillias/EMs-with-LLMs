  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical NPZ processes but with some structural differences. Uptake/growth are implemented as classical Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth (no explicit light/self-shading factor present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling-type III in both models and zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing matches the TRUTH structure (efficiency \u00d7 grazing). Nutrient recycling in the candidate is handled via an explicit detritus pool (dead biomass + unassimilated grazing \u2192 D \u2192 remineralization \u2192 N) and by a zooplankton excretion term; TRUTH instead returns some recycling terms directly to N. Mixing/entrainment for nutrients is identical in form. The candidate adds quadratic mortality terms for P and Z (density-dependent loss) and an explicit detritus state variable \u2014 both are departures from the TRUTH equations. Numerically, the candidate uses an Euler time-stepping loop (model-fitting code, with likelihood) whereas TRUTH used an ODE solver (RK45) for a forward simulation.",
