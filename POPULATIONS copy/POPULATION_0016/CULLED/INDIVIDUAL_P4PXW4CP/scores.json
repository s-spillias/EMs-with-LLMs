  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with some important structural differences from the TRUTH Python model. Both models include nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, mortality terms, and a mixing/dilution of nutrients. Key differences: the candidate uses a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake in N only (no explicit light/self-shading term a/(b+cP) present in TRUTH), implements grazing as a Holling type III (which matches TRUTH form), and routes unassimilated production and mortalities through an explicit detritus pool with remineralization back to nutrients (TRUTH returns some recycling terms directly to N). The candidate also includes quadratic (density-dependent) mortality terms for P and Z that are not present in TRUTH. Overall most canonical processes are present, but several are implemented as literature alternates or extended (detritus + quadratic mortality).",

TRUTH uses (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P))*P which includes an additional P-dependent light/self-shading factor (a/(b+c*P)).
