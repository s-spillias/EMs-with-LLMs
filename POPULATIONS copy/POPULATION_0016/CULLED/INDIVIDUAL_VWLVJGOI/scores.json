  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake driving P growth, grazing transferring biomass to Z, recycling to N, and mortalities) but uses different functional forms and omits physical mixing/entrainment present in the TRUTH model. Key differences: nutrient uptake is a Hill-type (N^2/(K^2+N^2)) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b+cP)) factor; grazing is Holling type II (I_max*P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's Holling type III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)); candidate includes an additional quadratic zooplankton mortality term (m_Z2*Z^2) that is not in TRUTH; candidate omits the explicit mixing/dilution term for N (k*(N0-N)) and the P mixing term present in TRUTH. Assimilation/recycling is present but allocated differently (candidate returns (1-beta)*grazing to nutrients and recycles mortality m_P*P and m_Z*Z directly).",
