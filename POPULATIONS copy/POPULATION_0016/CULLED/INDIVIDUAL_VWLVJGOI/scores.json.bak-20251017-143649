  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 zooplankton grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model for several key processes. Uptake is implemented as a Hill/Holling-type III dependence on nutrient (N^2/(K_N^2+N^2) times P) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) times an explicit light-limitation factor a/(b + c P). Grazing in the candidate is Holling type II (I_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) versus the TRUTH's Holling-type III P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. Linear phytoplankton mortality is present and matches TRUTH in form (linear loss), but the candidate omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P in TRUTH). Zooplankton mortality includes both a linear term (matching TRUTH's linear loss) and an extra quadratic density-dependent term (m_Z2 * Z^2) that is not in the TRUTH model. The candidate also returns unassimilated grazing to nutrients via (1-beta)*grazing and returns mortality (m_P*P, m_Z*Z) to N, which are ecologically plausible but not identical to the multiple recycling terms in the TRUTH model.",
