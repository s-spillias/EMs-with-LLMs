  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling, and zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing. Many processes are present but parameterized with common alternates: uptake is simple Michaelis-Menten (no P-dependent light/shading term present in TRUTH), grazing is Holling type III and matches the TRUTH functional form, recycling is represented via unassimilated grazing, excretion and detritus remineralization rather than the exact TRUTH aggregation, and zooplankton growth is the expected assimilation-of-grazing formulation. The candidate adds an explicit detritus pool and quadratic (density-dependent) mortality terms not present in the TRUTH model, and it omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton that is present in TRUTH.",
