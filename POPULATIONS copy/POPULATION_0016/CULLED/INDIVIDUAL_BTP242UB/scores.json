  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with some important differences from the TRUTH reference. Uptake is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limited growth multiplied by P (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) instead of the TRUTH multiplicative form that also includes a light/size factor a/(b + c*P). Grazing is Holling type III and matches the TRUTH functional form (P^2/(K^2+P^2) * Z) modulo parameter names. Zooplankton growth is driven by assimilated grazing (beta*grazing) as in TRUTH. Recycling of nutrients is present but routed through an explicit detritus pool (D) with remineralization (epsilon * D) rather than the TRUTH direct recycling terms; excretion is present as a direct term. Phytoplankton mortality in the candidate includes both linear and quadratic terms; zooplankton mortality is quadratic (candidate) vs linear in TRUTH. The candidate also omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking term. Numerical integration uses an Euler time-stepping loop and a small-value floor for nonnegativity (numerical choices, not canonical ecology).",
