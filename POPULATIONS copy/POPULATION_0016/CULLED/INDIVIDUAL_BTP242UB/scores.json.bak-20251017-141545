  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes but with some structural differences. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake (no explicit P-dependent light/self-shading factor present in TRUTH). Grazing uses a Holling type III (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) identical in form to TRUTH and is used consistently for P loss and Z growth (with an explicit assimilation efficiency). Mixing/dilution of nutrients is present and matches TRUTH. The candidate adds an explicit detritus (D) pool: unassimilated grazing and mortalities feed D and D is remineralized back to N (an alternate recycling pathway compared to TRUTH, which recycles grazing losses more directly). The candidate also includes both linear and quadratic phytoplankton mortality and quadratic zooplankton mortality (TRUTH uses linear zooplankton mortality). The candidate omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/dilution term that appears in TRUTH. Numerically, the candidate uses an Euler time-step solver inside the likelihood framework (TMB) rather than integrating an ODE system with a solver as in TRUTH; this is noted but not scored here.",
