  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ processes but with several parametric/functional differences vs the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake is implemented as Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by a self-shading light limitation (an alternate functional form vs the TRUTH light factor). Grazing is Holling Type III (P^2/(..)+), matching TRUTH's functional family for predation and assimilation. Recycling to nutrients is present via unassimilated grazing, excretion and an explicit remineralization of dead biomass (an extra process not expressed the same way in TRUTH). Mixing of nutrients is implemented identically. Phytoplankton mixing/loss via explicit mixing/entrainment that appears in the TRUTH P equation is missing in the candidate. Zooplankton mortality is density-dependent (quadratic) in the candidate whereas TRUTH uses a linear loss. Numerical integration (explicit Euler stepping) and lognormal observation model are implementation details that differ but are not ecological processes.",
