  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake driving phytoplankton growth, Holling-type grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, recycling to nutrients, and an explicit detritus pool with remineralization. Compared with the TRUTH Python NPZ: (1) uptake/growth in the candidate uses a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten form in N (no explicit light/P-dependent term present in TRUTH), (2) grazing is Holling Type III and matches the TRUTH functional form modulo parameter names, (3) recycling (unassimilated grazing and excretion) is present though organized differently, (4) physical mixing of nutrients is present and matches TRUTH, but (5) physical mixing/loss for phytoplankton is missing, and (6) the candidate adds quadratic mortality terms (P and Z) and an explicit detritus pool + remineralization that are not present in the TRUTH model. Overall, most canonical processes are represented, often as acceptable alternates, but some structural differences (light limitation, P mixing) and additional processes (detritus, quadratic mortality) should be noted.",

TRUTH uses N/(e+N)*(a/(b+c*P))*P (nutrient + P-dependent term). The candidate lacks the TRUTH's P-dependent/light term (a/(b+c*P)), so it is an alternate (simple Michaelis-Menten in N)."
