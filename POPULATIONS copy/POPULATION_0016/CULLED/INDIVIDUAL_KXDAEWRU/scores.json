  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with clear counterparts to most TRUTH ecological processes: nutrient uptake (as Michaelis-Menten), Holling type-III grazing, assimilation/unassimilated grazing and excretion, linear phytoplankton mortality, and zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing. Key differences: the candidate omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH (no k*(N0-N) or (s+k)*P equivalents), represents zooplankton mortality as quadratic rather than TRUTH's linear loss, and routes mortality/decay through an explicit remineralization operator (epsilon*(...)) rather than the immediate recycling rates in TRUTH. Variable/parameter names differ (e.g., beta used for assimilation in candidate; TRUTH uses beta for a recycling fraction), but mapping of roles is largely possible.",
