  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the main NPZ processes but with several structural differences from the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth in the candidate is a simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limited form (no explicit light/ P-dependent term a/(b + c P) that appears in TRUTH). Grazing is implemented as a Holling Type\u2011III (P^2/(K^2+P^2) * Z) and matches the TRUTH functional form (modulo parameter names). Phytoplankton mortality is linear as in TRUTH, but the candidate lacks the explicit phytoplankton mixing/physical loss term present in TRUTH. Zooplankton growth is implemented by assimilated grazing and matches TRUTH structurally, but zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) in the candidate vs linear in TRUTH. The candidate also includes an explicit remineralization term applied to dead organic matter (epsilon * (p_mortality + z_mortality)), which is not present in the TRUTH equations (TRUTH recycles mortality via different direct terms). Overall, most canonical roles are present but several are alternate formulations or missing (mixing), and there is one extra explicit remineralization pathway.",
