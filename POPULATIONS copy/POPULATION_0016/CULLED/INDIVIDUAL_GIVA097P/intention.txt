Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid NPZ framework, capturing essential plankton dynamics with appropriate functional forms for nutrient uptake (Michaelis-Menten) and grazing (Holling Type III). However, a key oversimplification exists in the zooplankton mortality dynamics. The model exclusively uses a quadratic mortality term (`m_Z * Z_prev * Z_prev`), representing density-dependent losses. This unrealistically implies zero mortality at low zooplankton densities.

Proposed Improvement:
Introduce a linear mortality term for zooplankton to represent density-independent death.

Ecological Justification:
A linear mortality term (`m_Z_lin * Z_prev`) accounts for baseline death rates from natural causes like aging, disease, and non-gregarious predation, which persist even at low population densities. Combining this with the existing quadratic term creates a more realistic mortality function: `Total Mortality = (m_Z_lin * Z_prev) + (m_Z * Z_prev * Z_prev)`. This ensures that the model reflects a fundamental ecological principle—that organisms have a natural death rate independent of population pressure—while still accounting for increased mortality (e.g., from predation) when the population becomes large and dense. This change enhances the model's biological realism without significantly increasing its complexity.
