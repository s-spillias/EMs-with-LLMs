  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling-Type-III grazing, assimilation into zooplankton, excretion and mortality terms, and an explicit recycling (remineralization) term. Many components match the ecological roles in the TRUTH model and several match the same functional families (Michaelis-Menten uptake, Holling type-III grazing, linear mortality). However the candidate differs in details: uptake is a simple Michaelis-Menten * P (no additional light/attenuation factor present in TRUTH), recycling is implemented via unassimilated grazing + remineralization (different partitioning and an explicit epsilon term), and there is no explicit physical mixing / entrainment term of the form k*(N0 - N). The candidate also includes quadratic mortality terms (P^2 and Z^2) and an explicit remineralization of dead organic matter, which are not present in the TRUTH equations.",

TRUTH: '-(N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P' uses N/(e+N)*P multiplied by an additional factor a/(b+cP). The candidate matches the Michaelis-Menten family but omits the TRUTH model's extra (a/(b+c*P)) factor, so it's an alternate formulation."
