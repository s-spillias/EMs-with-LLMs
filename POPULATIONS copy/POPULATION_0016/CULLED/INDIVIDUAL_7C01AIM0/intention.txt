Model Assessment:
The current NPZ model provides a solid, standard framework for simulating plankton dynamics. It includes Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, a Holling Type II grazing response, and nutrient recycling pathways. However, some processes are simplified. For instance, environmental factors like light and temperature are omitted. The mortality terms also represent an area for potential refinement. While I cannot assess the model's fit to data without access to residuals, I can propose improvements based on ecological principles.

Identified Oversimplification:
The model currently represents zooplankton mortality solely with a quadratic term (`m_Z * Z^2`). This term is typically used to represent density-dependent losses like predation from higher trophic levels or cannibalism. However, it omits density-independent mortality sources, such as natural death (senescence), disease, or baseline metabolic losses, which are often represented by a linear mortality term (`m * Z`). Phytoplankton mortality in the model already includes such a linear term (`m_P * P`). Applying a similar logic to zooplankton would create a more symmetrical and ecologically realistic representation of mortality processes for both plankton groups.

Proposed Improvement:
I will introduce a linear mortality term for zooplankton, in addition to the existing quadratic term. The zooplankton mortality rate will be changed from `m_Z * Z^2` to `m_Z_lin * Z + m_Z_quad * Z^2`.

Justification:
This change introduces a density-independent death rate for zooplankton, which is biologically plausible. At low zooplankton densities, the quadratic term becomes negligible, and this new linear term will ensure a baseline mortality rate, preventing the population from persisting unrealistically without loss. At high densities, the quadratic term will still dominate, representing increased predation pressure. This more nuanced mortality function can improve model stability and lead to more realistic zooplankton dynamics across a range of population densities.

Implementation Details:
1. In `parameters.json`, the existing `m_Z` parameter will be renamed to `m_Z_quad` to clarify its role.
2. A new parameter, `m_Z_lin`, will be added to `parameters.json` to represent the linear mortality rate.
3. In `model.cpp`, the zooplankton mortality equation will be updated to incorporate both terms, and the new parameter will be declared.
