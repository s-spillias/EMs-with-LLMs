  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, mortality and recycling) but uses alternate mathematical forms for several of them. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Michaelis\u2013Menten form (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N) * (a/(b+cP)) * P. Grazing is a Holling type II (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form. The candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton equivalent to TRUTH's k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P. The model adds explicit remineralization of dead organic matter and an extra quadratic zooplankton mortality term, which are not present in the TRUTH formulation. Overall: most canonical roles are present but several are implemented as literature alternatives and two extra ecological processes are introduced.",
