  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, a Holling type III grazing, assimilation to zooplankton, and explicit recycling. It departs from the TRUTH model in two important ways: (1) it does not include the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N) present in TRUTH, and (2) it introduces an explicit detritus pool with remineralization (D, epsilon) and quadratic mortality terms. Several components match TRUTH's functional families exactly (Holling type III grazing, grazing-driven zooplankton growth), while others follow common alternates from the literature (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, quadratic mortality). Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and follows canonical alternatives, but it is missing the explicit mixing/dilution term from TRUTH and adds a detritus compartment (new process).",
