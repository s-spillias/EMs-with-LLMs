  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality and zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing. However it differs from the TRUTH model in several mechanistic details: uptake is a simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten term without the TRUTH light-limitation factor; phytoplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms (TRUTH only has linear losses); zooplankton mortality is implemented as quadratic plus an explicit excretion term (TRUTH uses linear mortality q*Z and a separate excretion-like term). The candidate also adds an explicit detritus (D) state with remineralization, which is not present in the TRUTH model. Several physical mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH (e.g., k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P) are absent in the candidate.",
