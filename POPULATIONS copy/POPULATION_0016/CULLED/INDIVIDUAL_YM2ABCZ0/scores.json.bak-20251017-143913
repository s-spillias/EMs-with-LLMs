  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with uptake, grazing, mortality, excretion and recycling pathways. Many functional roles match the TRUTH model but several terms use different functional forms or bookkeeping. Uptake/growth in the candidate is classic Michaelis\u2013Menten (no explicit P-dependent light/self-shading factor present in TRUTH). Grazing and zooplankton growth are implemented as Holling Type III and map directly to the TRUTH grazing structure (same P^2/(K^2+P^2) form). The candidate adds density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality and an explicit remineralization term that recycles both phytoplankton and zooplankton mortalities to nutrients\u2014these are not present in the TRUTH in the same form. The candidate also omits the TRUTH\u2019s explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N)) in the nutrient equation.",
