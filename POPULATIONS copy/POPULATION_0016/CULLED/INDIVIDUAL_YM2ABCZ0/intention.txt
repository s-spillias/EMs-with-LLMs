Model Assessment:
The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) formulation. It uses a Michaelis-Menten function for nutrient uptake and a Holling Type II functional response for zooplankton grazing. While this is a classic approach, the Holling Type II response can be an oversimplification. It implies that zooplankton are maximally efficient at finding phytoplankton even at very low concentrations, which can lead to unrealistic predator-prey dynamics and potentially cause the phytoplankton population to crash.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
To enhance the model's ecological realism, I will replace the Holling Type II grazing functional response with a Holling Type III response.

Reasoning and Justification:
A Holling Type III response is sigmoidal (S-shaped), meaning the grazing pressure on phytoplankton is reduced at low phytoplankton densities. This better represents several real-world phenomena:
1. Prey Refuge: At low densities, phytoplankton are harder for zooplankton to find, creating a natural refuge that prevents their complete extinction.
2. Prey Switching: It implicitly models the behavior of zooplankton switching to other food sources when phytoplankton are scarce.

This change will increase the stability of the predator-prey interaction, particularly at low population densities, which is a more plausible representation of many marine ecosystems.

Implementation Details:
- The grazing equation in `model.cpp` will be changed from `g_max * P / (K_P + P) * Z` to `g_max * P^2 / (K_P^2 + P^2) * Z`.
- The description for the `K_P` parameter in `parameters.json` will be updated to clarify its role in the new Holling Type III formulation.
