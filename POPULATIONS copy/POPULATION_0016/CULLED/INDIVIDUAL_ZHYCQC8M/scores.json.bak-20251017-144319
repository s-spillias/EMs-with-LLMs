  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling back to nutrients, and phytoplankton/zooplankton mortality). Several processes match the TRUTH model algebraically (Holling type\u2011III grazing; assimilated grazing driving Z growth; linear P mortality). However the candidate uses a simpler Michaelis\u2011Menten form for nutrient uptake/growth (no secondary P\u2011dependent modifier present in TRUTH), replaces TRUTH's linear Z mortality with quadratic mortality + an explicit excretion loss, and omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH. The candidate also includes an explicit remineralization term of dead organic matter (epsilon*(p_mortality + z_mortality)) that does not appear in the TRUTH equations.",
