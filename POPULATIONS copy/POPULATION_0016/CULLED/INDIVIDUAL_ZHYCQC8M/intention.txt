Model Assessment:
The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) formulation, which serves as a good baseline for simulating plankton dynamics. It uses a Michaelis-Menten function for nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and a Holling Type II functional response for grazing by zooplankton. While these are common choices, the Holling Type II response may be an oversimplification. It assumes that zooplankton search efficiency is constant, which can lead to excessive grazing pressure at very low phytoplankton concentrations. This can cause instability in the model, potentially leading to unrealistic extinctions of phytoplankton and a poorer fit to real-world data where prey populations often persist at low densities.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
To enhance the model's ecological realism, I am changing the zooplankton grazing dynamics from a Holling Type II to a Holling Type III functional response.

Reasoning for Improvement:
A Holling Type III response is characterized by a sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve. This means that at low phytoplankton concentrations, the grazing rate is disproportionately low and accelerates as phytoplankton become more abundant, before eventually saturating. This pattern is ecologically significant as it represents several possible real-world phenomena, such as:
1.  Prey Switching: Zooplankton may switch to alternative food sources (not explicitly modeled) when their primary food (phytoplankton) is scarce.
2.  Prey Refugia: At low densities, phytoplankton may have spatial refuges where they are safe from predation.
3.  Search Image: Predators may become more efficient at finding prey as the prey become more common.

By implementing a Holling Type III response, the model will provide a refuge for phytoplankton at low densities, reducing grazing pressure and promoting the stability and coexistence of predator and prey. This modification adds a crucial layer of realism to the predator-prey interaction without requiring additional data inputs. The mathematical formulation will be changed from `g_max * P / (K_P + P)` to `g_max * P^2 / (K_P^2 + P^2)`.
