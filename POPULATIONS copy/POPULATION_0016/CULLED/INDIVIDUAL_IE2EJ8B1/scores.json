  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ-style model but with an explicit detritus pool (D) and Euler time stepping. Phytoplankton growth is driven by a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (multiplicative with P) rather than the TRUTH model's combined nutrient+P-dependent/light term. Grazing is Holling type III and matches the TRUTH functional form (P^2/(K^2+P^2) * Z), and zooplankton growth is assimilated grazing (matching TRUTH structure). The candidate routes non-assimilated grazing and detritus remineralization back to nutrients (recycling) via an explicit detritus state, whereas TRUTH uses direct recycling terms and an explicit mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (k*(N0 - N) and k*P) that the candidate lacks. Zooplankton mortality is density-dependent with a phytoplankton 'refuge' modifier in the candidate, differing from TRUTH's linear loss.",
