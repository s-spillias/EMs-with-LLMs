  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZD-style dynamics that shares many core processes with the TRUTH NPZ model but also introduces an explicit detritus pool and density-dependent mortality/closure formulations. Key matches: both models use a Michaelis-/saturating-type nutrient uptake (but the candidate uses the simple Michaelis-Menten form), both use a Holling-type Type III grazing (the grazing functional P^2/(K^2+P^2) * Z is essentially identical), and both convert a fraction of grazing into zooplankton growth (assimilation efficiency). Major differences: the candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients, includes detritus + remineralization pathways (not in TRUTH), and uses quadratic/density-dependent zooplankton mortality modulated by a phytoplankton \"refuge\". Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and mostly aligns with literature alternates; several specific components are exact or close matches to TRUTH (grazing, Z growth, P linear mortality), while others are alternates or missing (uptake form, recycling decomposed into detritus + remineralization, no mixing).",
