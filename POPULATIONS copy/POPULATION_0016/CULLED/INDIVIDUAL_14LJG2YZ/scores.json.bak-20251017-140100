  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure and most core processes (nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality, assimilation) but differs in mathematical detail from the TRUTH model. Uptake in the candidate is a straightforward Michaelis\u2013Menten form multiplied by P, whereas TRUTH uses a product of a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term and a P-dependent half-saturation (a/(b + c*P)) multiplying P. Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type III (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) and matches TRUTH's grazing form closely. Recycling in the candidate is split into explicit unassimilated grazing, excretion (continuous), and a separate remineralization of dead organic matter; TRUTH recycles via specific terms (beta* grazing and gamma*q*Z) and also has an explicit mixing/entrainment term in dN (k*(N0-N)) that is missing from the candidate. The candidate also includes quadratic mortality terms (P and Z) and an explicit remineralization coefficient (epsilon) \u2014 processes absent from TRUTH. Numerically, the candidate uses forward Euler time-stepping and a lognormal observation model with parameter penalties (implementation choices rather than new ecological state variables).",
