  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZD-style dynamics with the same high-level ecological processes as the TRUTH NPZ model, but with some structural differences. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Michaelis-Menten N-dependence multiplied by P in the candidate (no explicit P-dependent light factor present in TRUTH), grazing is implemented as a Holling type-III functional response in both models (structurally equivalent), and zooplankton growth is the Holling-III \u00d7 efficiency form in both. The candidate adds an explicit detritus state with remineralization and includes quadratic mortality terms for P and Z (alternates not present in TRUTH). Physical mixing for nutrients is the same form (exchange with deep water). Overall the candidate matches many canonical processes but some are alternate formulations (especially uptake and non-grazing mortality) and one clear extra component (detritus pool) is introduced.",
