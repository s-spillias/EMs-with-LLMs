Model Assessment:
The current model is a well-structured NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) model using standard ecological functional forms (Michaelis-Menten for uptake, Holling Type III for grazing). It correctly simulates the core interactions outlined in the project context.

Identified Simplification:
The primary simplification is the phytoplankton mortality term, which is currently linear (`m_P * P`). This implies a constant per-capita death rate, which is unrealistic at high population densities. Real phytoplankton populations experience increased mortality at high densities due to effects like self-shading (reducing light availability), increased prevalence of diseases and viral lysis, and localized nutrient depletion.

Proposed Improvement:
To address this, I will introduce a quadratic mortality term for phytoplankton. The mortality calculation will be updated to include a density-dependent component: `p_mortality = m_P * P_prev + m_P_quad * P_prev * P_prev`.

Justification:
1.  Ecological Realism: This new term (`m_P_quad`) simulates the negative feedback of self-limitation on the phytoplankton population, preventing unrealistic blooms and providing more stable dynamics.
2.  Structural Enhancement: It adds a crucial density-dependent regulation mechanism for the model's primary producers, mirroring the existing quadratic mortality for zooplankton.
3.  Parsimony: This significant improvement in ecological realism is achieved by adding only a single new parameter (`m_P_quad`), adhering to the principle of keeping the model as simple as possible while capturing essential dynamics.
