  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements all three state variables and the major ecological flows (uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality), but with several structural differences from the TRUTH Python model. Uptake in the candidate is a standard Michaelis\u2013Menten N-uptake multiplied by P (no explicit light/self-shading term present in TRUTH). Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type III (mathematically the same P^2/(K^2+P^2) form used in TRUTH), with an assimilation efficiency feeding Z and unassimilated material recycled to N (so grazing structure and assimilation are effectively TRUTH-matching). However, the candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (TRUTH's k*(N0 - N)) and for phytoplankton; instead it adds quadratic mortality terms and an explicit remineralization term for dead organic matter (epsilon * (p_mortality + z_mortality)). The candidate also uses an Euler time-stepping integration (numerical implementation difference) and a lognormal observation model. Overall: grazing and zooplankton growth match TRUTH closely; uptake and mortalities use alternate common functional forms; mixing is missing.",
