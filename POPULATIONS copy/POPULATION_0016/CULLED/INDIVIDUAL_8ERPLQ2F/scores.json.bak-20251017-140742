  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ architecture and many core processes from the TRUTH model but with some important structural differences. Uptake/growth is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth (candidate) versus the TRUTH product of nutrient limitation and an additional a/(b + c*P) factor (self-shading/light limitation). Grazing is a direct match (Holling type III), and assimilated grazing drives zooplankton growth as in TRUTH. The candidate differs by (a) omitting the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH, (b) using quadratic zooplankton mortality and adding quadratic phytoplankton mortality (density-dependent loss) as well as an explicit remineralization of dead organic matter back to nutrients, and (c) implementing an observation/log-likelihood layer and an explicit numerical Euler stepping (not in the TRUTH script). Overall: grazing and assimilation are TRUTH-equivalent, uptake and most mortalities are alternate formulations, and mixing is missing.",

TRUTH: \"(N/(e + N)) * (a/(b + c * P)) * P\" \u2014 candidate lacks the additional a/(b + c*P) light/self-shading factor present in TRUTH, so it is an alternate (Michaelis\u2013Menten) formulation."

TRUTH uses grazing-related recycling and excretion terms (e.g. \"(beta * lambda_ * P**2/(mu**2 + P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z\") but the candidate uses a different bookkeeping (unassimilated fraction + explicit remineralization), so this is an alternate implementation of recycling."
