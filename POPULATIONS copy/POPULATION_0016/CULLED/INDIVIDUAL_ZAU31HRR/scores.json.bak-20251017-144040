  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the standard NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth; grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth with assimilation; recycling to nutrients; phytoplankton and zooplankton non-grazing losses). However the functional forms differ in several places from the TRUTH reference: the candidate uses simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake and Holling type II grazing, whereas TRUTH uses a product of a nutrient saturation and a different phytoplankton-dependent light/photophysiology term and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing kernel. The candidate includes an explicit remineralization of dead organic matter (epsilon*(p_mortality+z_mortality)) that is not present in TRUTH. Two physical mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) in nutrients and (s+k)*P in phytoplankton) are absent from the candidate. Numerically the candidate integrates forward with an Euler time-step inside the objective and fits observation error via a lognormal likelihood; TRUTH used an ODE integrator externally. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but often with alternate, commonly used functional families (Michaelis\u2013Menten, Holling II, quadratic mortality), and it omits explicit mixing/entrainment terms from TRUTH while adding an explicit remineralization pathway.",
