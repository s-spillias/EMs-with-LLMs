This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton food web in the oceanic mixed layer, based on the Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) framework. The model consists of three state variables representing the concentrations of key components in grams of Carbon per cubic meter (g C m^-3):

1.  Nutrient (N): Represents the pool of dissolved inorganic nutrients (e.g., nitrate) available for primary production.
2.  Phytoplankton (P): The primary producers that consume nutrients to grow.
3.  Zooplankton (Z): The primary consumers that graze on phytoplankton.

The ecological processes governing the interactions are:
- Phytoplankton Growth: Phytoplankton uptake nutrients following a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) function, where growth is limited by nutrient concentration.
- Zooplankton Grazing: Zooplankton consume phytoplankton according to a Holling Type II functional response, where the grazing rate saturates at high phytoplankton concentrations.
- Metabolic Losses & Mortality: Each biological component experiences losses. Phytoplankton have a linear mortality rate (representing natural death and sinking). Zooplankton have a density-dependent (quadratic) mortality rate, representing predation from higher trophic levels, as well as metabolic losses through excretion.
- Nutrient Cycling: Nutrients are regenerated through several pathways. Unassimilated food from zooplankton grazing, metabolic excretion by zooplankton, and the remineralization of dead phytoplankton and zooplankton all contribute to replenishing the dissolved nutrient pool.

The model is formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and is solved numerically over time to predict the state of the ecosystem.
