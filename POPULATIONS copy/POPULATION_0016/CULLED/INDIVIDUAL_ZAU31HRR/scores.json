  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the standard NPZ processes (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing, recycling/excretion, phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton growth and mortality) but often with alternate functional forms compared with the TRUTH Python model. Uptake is implemented as a classic Michaelis\u2013Menten term (no explicit light/shading dependence on P as in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling Type II (TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2)\u2013style saturating term). Recycling is present via unassimilated grazing, excretion and a remineralization term, but there is no explicit environmental mixing/entrainment (k*(N0-N)) in the nutrient equation and no explicit mixing terms for P or Z. Phytoplankton linear mortality matches TRUTH structurally. Zooplankton mortality is quadratic in the candidate (alternate to TRUTH's linear loss). Numerical integration (Euler stepping), likelihood/observation model and parameter penalties are present in the candidate but are implementation/model-fitting features rather than novel ecological processes.",
