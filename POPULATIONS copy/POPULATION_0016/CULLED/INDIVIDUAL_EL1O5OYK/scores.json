  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure with nutrient uptake, grazing-mediated transfers, recycling, and mixing. Many ecological roles from the TRUTH model are present but several are implemented with alternate functional forms: uptake is simple Michaelis-Menten (no explicit light/biomass limitation factor present in TRUTH), grazing is Holling type II instead of the TRUTH Holling-III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)), phytoplankton mortality is quadratic rather than TRUTH's linear mortality, and the candidate adds an explicit zooplankton metabolic excretion term. The candidate matches TRUTH exactly for nutrient mixing and linear zooplankton mortality and matches the recycling role but using different partitioning. The candidate omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking loss term present in TRUTH.",
