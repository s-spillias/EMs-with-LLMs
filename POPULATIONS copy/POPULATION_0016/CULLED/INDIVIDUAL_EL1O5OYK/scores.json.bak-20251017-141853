  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ formulation with the same three state variables and the same broad ecological roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing-mediated transfer, recycling to nutrients, mixing with a deep pool, and zooplankton mortality). Functional forms differ in several places: the candidate uses a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake (no explicit light limitation), Holling Type II grazing, quadratic phytoplankton mortality, explicit zooplankton excretion, and a forward-Euler time stepping rather than the continuous ODE integrator used in TRUTH. Overall most canonical processes are present but several are alternate formulations relative to TRUTH and one explicit process (zooplankton excretion) appears as an extra component.",
