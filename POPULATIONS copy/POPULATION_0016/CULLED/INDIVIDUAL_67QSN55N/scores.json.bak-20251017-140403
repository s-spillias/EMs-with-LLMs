  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (multiplied by phytoplankton biomass), a Holling-type II grazing term, linear mortality for P and Z, and explicit excretion/remineralization from zooplankton. It therefore matches canonical ecological roles but uses different functional forms from the TRUTH model in several places: TRUTH uses a composite uptake that includes both N-limitation and a P-dependent light/attenuation factor (a/(b + c*P)) and a grazing formulation proportional to P^2/(mu^2 + P^2). The candidate lacks an environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (k*(N0 - N) and the (s+k)*P term in TRUTH). The candidate also implements the ecological transfers with different parameter grouping (e.g., assimilation beta, explicit excretion lambda and separate mortality mu_Z) and uses an Euler integrator and an observation model (likelihood/penalties) that are estimation features, not ecological processes.",
