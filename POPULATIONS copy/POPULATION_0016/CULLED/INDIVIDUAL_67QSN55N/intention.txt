This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton ecosystem, comprising three key components: Nutrients (N), Phytoplankton (P), and Zooplankton (Z). The model captures the fundamental trophic interactions and nutrient cycling within the oceanic mixed layer.

1.  **Phytoplankton Growth**: Phytoplankton consume nutrients for growth. This nutrient uptake is modeled using a Michaelis-Menten function, meaning the growth rate saturates as nutrient concentrations become high.
2.  **Zooplankton Grazing**: Zooplankton graze on phytoplankton. This predation is represented by a Holling Type II functional response, where the grazing rate saturates at high phytoplankton densities. A portion of the consumed phytoplankton is assimilated for zooplankton growth.
3.  **Mortality and Nutrient Recycling**: All living components are subject to mortality. Dead organic matter from phytoplankton and zooplankton, along with zooplankton metabolic waste (excretion), is assumed to be instantly remineralized back into the nutrient pool, closing the ecosystem's nutrient loop.

This structure creates a classic predator-prey-resource system with feedback loops, allowing for the simulation of phenomena like plankton blooms and subsequent crashes.
