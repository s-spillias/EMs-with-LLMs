  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ fluxes (nutrient uptake, grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, mortality) using common alternative functional forms. Grazing and zooplankton growth match the TRUTH functional form (Holling type III grazing with growth proportional to assimilation of that grazing). Phytoplankton nutrient uptake is implemented as a simpler Michaelis-Menten form and lacks the TRUTH model's additional P-dependent term (interpretable as self-shading / light limitation). The candidate explicitly includes quadratic mortality for both P and Z and an explicit remineralization of dead organic matter back to nutrients (epsilon * (p_mortality + z_mortality)), which is not present in the TRUTH NPZ. The candidate also omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and for phytoplankton that appears in the TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and a (s + k)*P loss).",
