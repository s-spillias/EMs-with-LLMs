Model Assessment:
The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) formulation that captures the basic trophic interactions in a plankton ecosystem. It uses Michaelis-Menten kinetics for nutrient uptake and a Holling Type II response for grazing. While this structure is a good foundation, the representation of phytoplankton mortality is oversimplified. It currently uses only a linear mortality term (m_P * P), which assumes the per-capita death rate is constant and independent of phytoplankton density. This is ecologically unrealistic, as high-density phytoplankton populations (blooms) often experience increased mortality due to self-shading, localized nutrient depletion, and higher rates of viral lysis.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
I will introduce a quadratic mortality term for phytoplankton to account for density-dependent losses. The phytoplankton mortality formulation will be updated from a purely linear model to a combined linear and quadratic model.

Old formulation: p_mortality = m_P * P
New formulation: p_mortality = m_P_lin * P + m_P_quad * P^2

Reasoning for Improvement:
This change introduces a critical negative feedback mechanism that regulates phytoplankton population size.
1.  The linear term (m_P_lin) continues to represent density-independent mortality factors like natural death and sinking.
2.  The new quadratic term (m_P_quad) represents density-dependent mortality. Its effect becomes significant only at high phytoplankton concentrations, effectively simulating self-limiting processes such as self-shading and increased susceptibility to disease/viral lysis in dense blooms.
3.  By incorporating this density-dependent regulation, the model will be better able to simulate the peak and subsequent decline of phytoplankton blooms, leading to more realistic population dynamics and preventing the model from predicting unbounded growth. This adds a key piece of ecological realism with minimal structural change.
