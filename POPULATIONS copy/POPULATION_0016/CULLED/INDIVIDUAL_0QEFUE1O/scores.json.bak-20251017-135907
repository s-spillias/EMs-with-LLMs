  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the broad ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing with assimilation, recycling/excretion back to nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality, and zooplankton growth from assimilated grazing. However the functional forms differ: the candidate uses standard Michaelis-Menten uptake and Holling type-II grazing (vs. the TRUTH's nutrient-limited \u00d7 a/(b+cP) form and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing kernel). The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N) in TRUTH). It also adds processes not present in TRUTH: quadratic (density-dependent) mortality for P and Z and an explicit remineralization term that converts both P and Z mortalities to dissolved nutrients (epsilon * (p_mortality + z_mortality)). Overall the candidate matches canonical roles but with alternate, commonly used functional forms and a few extra closure terms.",

TRUTH uses N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c*P)) * P, so the candidate uses an alternate Michaelis-Menten family rather than the exact TRUTH functional form."
