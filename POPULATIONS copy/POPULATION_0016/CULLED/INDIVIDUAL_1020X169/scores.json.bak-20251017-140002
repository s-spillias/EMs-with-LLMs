  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes but with several formulation differences. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as classical Michaelis-Menten nutrient-limited, biomass-proportional uptake (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH two-factor form that multiplies nutrient limitation by an additional light/self-shading term (a/(b + c*P)). Grazing is a Holling Type III P^2/(K_P^2+P^2) form in both models and maps directly. Nutrient recycling is present via unassimilated grazing, excretion and an explicit remineralization term, but the partitioning and parameter names differ from TRUTH. The candidate also includes explicit quadratic mortality terms (both P and Z) and a remineralization parameter (epsilon) that change closure dynamics relative to TRUTH. Physical mixing of nutrients is implemented equivalently; mixing of phytoplankton is not explicitly represented in the candidate.",
