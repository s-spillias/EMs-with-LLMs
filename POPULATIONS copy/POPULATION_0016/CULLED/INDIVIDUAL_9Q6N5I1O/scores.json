  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure: Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling Type II grazing, linear mortality for P and Z, and recycling of non-assimilated grazing plus mortality-derived remineralization into nutrients. It differs from the TRUTH model in three main ways: (1) the TRUTH uptake term includes an additional P-dependent factor a/(b + c*P) (candidate lacks this), (2) the TRUTH grazing uses a P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) saturating form (candidate uses Holling II P/(K_P+P)), and (3) the TRUTH model contains an explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N) (candidate omits any mixing/entrainment). The candidate also uses Euler time-stepping and adds numerical/positivity penalties (non-ecological implementation details). Overall the candidate matches canonical ecological roles but uses alternate functional forms for uptake and grazing and omits nutrient mixing.",
