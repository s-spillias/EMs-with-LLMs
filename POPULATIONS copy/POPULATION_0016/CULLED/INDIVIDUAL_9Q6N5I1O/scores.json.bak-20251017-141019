  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard 3-box NPZ with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, Holling type-II grazing, linear non-grazing mortality, and assimilation-driven zooplankton growth. These map reasonably to the TRUTH NPZ roles but differ in functional detail: the candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term and the TRUTH light/attenuation factor in phytoplankton growth, and it uses Holling-II grazing (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form. The candidate treats recycling as (1-beta)*grazing plus direct mortality returns, whereas the TRUTH uses several distinct grazing-related recycling terms (beta*lambda_... and gamma*q*Z) and an explicit mixing return k*(N0-N). The candidate also contains estimation and numerical-details (penalties, forward-Euler stepping, lognormal observation model) that are not ecological processes.",
