  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, mortality and recycling) and matches the TRUTH model closely for grazing form and phytoplankton linear mortality. Key differences: uptake is a simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten form (no light/self-shading factor present in TRUTH), zooplankton mortality is quadratic instead of linear, there is an explicit remineralization term (epsilon) converting mortalities to dissolved nutrient which is not in TRUTH, and the model omits the environmental mixing/entrainment terms for N and P present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and maps mostly to alternates from the literature, with some exact matches (Holling type III grazing, linear P mortality) and some departures (mixing absent, different recycling partitioning).",
