  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ processes but with several structural differences from the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limited uptake multiplied by P (candidate) whereas TRUTH multiplies the N-limitation by an additional P-dependent term (a/(b + c P)) representing self-shading/light limitation. Grazing uses the same Holling-type III functional form in both models and zooplankton growth is assimilation* grazing in both (equivalent structure). The candidate adds quadratic (density-dependent) mortality for P and Z, an explicit remineralization term of dead organic matter, and an explicit excretion term that directly reduces Z \u2014 processes not present in the TRUTH formulation. Mixing of nutrients is present and equivalent (delta*(N0-N) vs k*(N0-N)), but mixing of P is present in TRUTH (via k included in (s+k)*P) and absent in the candidate. Overall, most ecological roles are present; some are algebraically equivalent to TRUTH, others match documented alternates (e.g., Michaelis-Menten uptake, quadratic mortality, Holling III grazing).",
