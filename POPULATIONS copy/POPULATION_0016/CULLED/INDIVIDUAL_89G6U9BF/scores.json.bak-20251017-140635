  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton (Michaelis\u2013Menten style), grazing by zooplankton with a Holling-type III functional response, assimilation/unassimilated fractions and excretion, and an explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term identical in form to TRUTH. It departs from TRUTH in several ways: the light/attenuation factor (a/(b + c P)) present in TRUTH's uptake/growth is absent; phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality include extra quadratic density-dependent terms; there is an explicit remineralization of dead organic matter (epsilon * mortalities) not present in TRUTH; and phytoplankton physical mixing/loss is not represented explicitly (no -delta*P term). Parameter names and some algebraic grouping differ, but many ecological roles are present and map clearly to known alternate formulations in the literature.",

TRUTH uses (N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c*P))*P (an MM-like N-term multiplied by an additional a/(b+cP) attenuation). The candidate lacks the TRUTH light/attenuation factor, so it matches the MM family (alternate)."
