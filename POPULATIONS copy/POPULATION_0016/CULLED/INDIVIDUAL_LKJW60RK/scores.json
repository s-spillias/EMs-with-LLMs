  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ core with the same high-level processes (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, zooplankton growth/mortality) but uses alternate mathematical implementations for many components and adds an explicit detritus compartment and detritivore pathways. Uptake is Michaelis-Menten multiplied by a multiplicative self-shading term (alternate to the TRUTH a/(b + c*P) light factor). Grazing on phytoplankton is essentially the same Holling-type III form as TRUTH. Recycling is implemented via an explicit detritus pool (mortality -> detritus -> remineralization) plus unassimilated grazing and excretion, instead of the direct recycling terms in TRUTH. Mixing/entrainment is represented as a constant external supply (N_supply) rather than the TRUTH relaxation k*(N0 - N). The candidate also uses Euler time-stepping and an observation/error model (lognormal likelihood) and penalty priors, which are modelling/estimation extras but not ecological processes.",
