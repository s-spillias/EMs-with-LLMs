  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ ecology: phytoplankton growth via nutrient uptake with a light/self-shading factor, Holling type-III grazing by zooplankton, assimilation-based zooplankton growth, and recycling/excretion back to the nutrient pool. Where it differs from the TRUTH model are (1) routing of mortality through an explicit detritus pool with grazing on detritus, remineralization and sinking (TRUTH has no D pool), (2) zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) rather than the TRUTH's linear loss, and (3) the candidate uses a constant N_supply source term rather than TRUTH's proportional mixing k*(N0 - N). Overall the candidate matches most canonical roles but uses alternate formulations or extra state dynamics for recycling and zooplankton closure.",
