  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure and captures most canonical processes (nutrient uptake, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, recycling, and mixing). Where it differs from the TRUTH Python NPZ is mainly in the specific functional forms: the candidate uses a plain Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake in N (no P-dependent modifier present in TRUTH), implements a Holling Type III grazing that is algebraically equivalent to TRUTH\u2019s P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (but adds a phytoplankton refuge threshold), represents recycling via explicit unassimilated grazing + remineralization + excretion (different bookkeeping from TRUTH\u2019s beta*lambda term), and uses quadratic mortality for some components where TRUTH uses linear mortality. Overall the candidate matches TRUTH for mixing and grazing/assimilation structure, uses alternate but standard functional forms for uptake and mortality, and introduces an explicit refuge and a remineralization term that are not in TRUTH.",
