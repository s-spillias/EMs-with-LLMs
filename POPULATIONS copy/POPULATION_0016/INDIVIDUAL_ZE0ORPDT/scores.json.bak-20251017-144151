  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with several important differences from the TRUTH (ground-truth) NPZ. It matches the TRUTH model closely for zooplankton grazing (Holling Type III) and the corresponding assimilated grazing (zooplankton growth). Phytoplankton growth and nutrient uptake are present as a Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by a self-shading/light limitation, but the algebraic form of the light/self-shading term differs from the TRUTH form (so it is an alternate implementation rather than an exact match). The candidate deliberately omits an environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton that is present in TRUTH, and it adds an explicit detritus state variable D with remineralization and sinking (an extra component). The candidate also uses linear+quadratic phytoplankton mortality and quadratic zooplankton mortality (alternates relative to TRUTH\u2019s primarily linear mortality).",
