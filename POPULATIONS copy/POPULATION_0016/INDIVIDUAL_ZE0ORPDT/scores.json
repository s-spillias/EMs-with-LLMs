  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the same core interactions (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling-III grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, and mortality/recycling) but uses different algebraic forms and adds an explicit detritus pool and associated sinking/remineralization. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by a self-shading factor (an alternate but common formulation to the TRUTH model's multiplicative nutrient and light-limitation). Grazing is essentially identical (Holling type III). Recycling to nutrients is implemented via unassimilated grazing, excretion and detritus remineralization rather than the exact TRUTH terms. The candidate omits an explicit mixing/entrainment term for N (present in TRUTH) and omits explicit physical mixing for P, but matches TRUTH in lacking an explicit Z mixing term. Numerical integration (Euler time-stepping) and an explicit detritus state are important implementation differences.",
