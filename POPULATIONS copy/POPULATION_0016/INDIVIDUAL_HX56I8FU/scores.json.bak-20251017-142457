  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient uptake, grazing, assimilation to Z, recycling, and mixing) but using slightly different functional choices and an explicit detritus pool. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as classic Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth (no explicit light-limitation term present as in TRUTH). Grazing uses a Holling-III (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) functional response like TRUTH. Recycling is represented via unassimilated grazing, excretion, and detritus remineralization rather than the single direct recycling term in TRUTH. Physical mixing for nutrients is present and matches TRUTH form, but there is no explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss term. The candidate therefore matches many ecological roles but differs in some mathematical detail (and adds a detritus state and remineralization pathway not present in the TRUTH model).",

TRUTH used a compound (N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c * P))*P including an explicit light/shading term; the candidate therefore implements an alternate (MM) uptake form."
