  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, Holling-type grazing, zooplankton growth via assimilation, recycling to nutrients) but differs from the TRUTH model in several functional forms and adds an explicit detritus pool. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as classic Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth (alternate to the TRUTH two-factor form). Grazing is the same Holling Type III family as TRUTH. Mortality representations differ: the candidate includes both linear and quadratic P mortality and quadratic Z mortality (TRUTH uses linear mortality). The candidate includes nutrient mixing in the same linear entrainment form as TRUTH. The solver/numerics and observation model (Euler time stepping and log-normal observation likelihood) are implementation details not present in TRUTH but do not change the ecological bookkeeping except for the explicit detritus state and remineralization pathway.",
