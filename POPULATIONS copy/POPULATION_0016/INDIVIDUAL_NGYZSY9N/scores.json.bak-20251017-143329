  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the main NPZ processes (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth and grazing, zooplankton assimilation and mortality) using standard functional forms. Uptake and light-limitation are represented as Michaelis\u2013Menten \u00d7 self-shading (slightly different algebra from TRUTH but ecologically equivalent). Grazing uses a Holling type-III P^2/(K^2+P^2) form, matching the TRUTH grazing family. Key differences: the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N) in TRUTH), introduces an explicit detritus state (D_pred) with sinking and remineralization (not present in TRUTH), and uses quadratic zooplankton mortality rather than TRUTH's linear mortality. Overall most canonical roles are present though some functional choices differ and mixing is missing.",
