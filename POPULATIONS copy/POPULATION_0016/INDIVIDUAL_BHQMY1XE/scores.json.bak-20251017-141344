  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, phytoplankton mortality, and zooplankton growth from assimilated grazing), but it is not a line-by-line transcription of the TRUTH Python model. Uptake is implemented as a Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by a self-shading light limitation (different algebraic light form than TRUTH). Grazing on phytoplankton is the same Holling-type III functional form as TRUTH and the phytoplankton linear mortality is present. Important differences: the candidate adds an explicit detritus state D with detritus grazing, remineralization and sinking (new compared with TRUTH), uses quadratic zooplankton mortality (where TRUTH used linear mortality q*Z), and omits an explicit mixing/entrainment term that in TRUTH was k*(N0 - N) and also contributed a (s+k)*P loss for phytoplankton. Numerically, the candidate integrates with an Euler time-stepping loop rather than an ODE solver and includes an observation/likelihood model (log-normal) and soft parameter penalties, which are implementation details not present in the TRUTH forward-model script.",
