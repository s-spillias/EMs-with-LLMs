Model Assessment:
The current model is a standard NPZD (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus) formulation that captures the core dynamics of a simple plankton ecosystem. Key strengths include the implementation of phytoplankton self-shading and a Holling Type III functional response for zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton, which provides a refuge for phytoplankton at low densities.

The primary simplification identified is the zooplankton diet, which is restricted solely to phytoplankton. This overlooks the common ecological reality that many zooplankton are omnivorous and consume detritus as a supplementary or alternative food source. This missing pathway represents an opportunity to improve the model's representation of carbon flow and food web stability.

Proposed Improvement: Introduce Zooplankton Omnivory

Rationale:
To enhance ecological realism, I will modify the model to include zooplankton omnivory, allowing them to graze on both phytoplankton (P) and detritus (D). This change introduces a crucial ecological interaction, providing a more robust food web structure where zooplankton have an alternative food source when phytoplankton is scarce. This also improves the model's simulation of the role of detritus in the ecosystem's carbon cycle.

Implementation Plan:
1.  A new grazing term will be added to allow zooplankton to feed on detritus. This will be modeled using a Holling Type II functional response (`g_max_D * D / (K_D + D) * Z`), which is suitable for a passive food source like detritus. The existing Holling Type III response for phytoplankton grazing will be retained.
2.  To support this, three new parameters will be introduced in `parameters.json`:
    *   `g_max_D`: Maximum grazing rate on detritus.
    *   `K_D`: Half-saturation constant for detritus grazing.
    *   `beta_D`: Assimilation efficiency for consumed detritus.
3.  For clarity, the existing parameters `g_max` and `beta` will be renamed to `g_max_P` and `beta_P` to explicitly link them to phytoplankton grazing.
4.  The differential equations in `model.cpp` for Nutrient (dN/dt), Zooplankton (dZ/dt), and Detritus (dD/dt) will be updated to reflect this new pathway. Carbon from consumed detritus will be assimilated by zooplankton or returned to the nutrient pool via sloppy feeding, consistent with the model's existing structure.
