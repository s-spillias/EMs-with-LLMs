  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient uptake and Holling Type-II grazing formulation with explicit assimilation efficiencies and an Euler forward integrator. It omits the TRUTH model's light-limitation term (a/(b + c*P)) and the explicit mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations. Recycling in the candidate is formulated as a fraction of mortality (gamma_bounded*(P_loss+Z_loss)); it does not explicitly return an unassimilated fraction of grazing to nutrients as the TRUTH model does. The candidate also introduces (1) an explicit phytoplankton assimilation/exudation parameter (epsilon_P_bounded) that allows part of uptake to be lost (not present in TRUTH) and (2) quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality (m_Z2 * Z^2), which is not in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches many ecological roles but uses alternate mathematical choices (Monod, Holling II, explicit efficiencies) and omits mixing and TRUTH's P-dependent light limitation.",
