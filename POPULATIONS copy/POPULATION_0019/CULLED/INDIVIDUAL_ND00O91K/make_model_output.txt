Key Observation from Parameters:                                                                                                                                                                                            

Looking at the parameter values, I notice that several efficiency parameters use logit transformations:

Missing Ecological Process:                                                                                                                                                                                                 

A critical missing component in marine NPZ models is temperature dependence. All biological rates (growth, grazing, mortality) are strongly temperature-dependent in marine systems, following approximately exponential    
(Arrhenius-type) relationships. The current model treats all rates as constants, which is unrealistic for oceanic systems where temperature varies seasonally and with depth.                                               

However, without temperature data provided, I'll focus on another important missing process: density-dependent mortality for zooplankton. The current model has only linear mortality (m_Z * Z), but in reality, zooplankton
experience higher-order mortality due to predation by higher trophic levels (fish, jellyfish, etc.). This predation is often density-dependent and can be represented as quadratic mortality, which creates more realistic  
population dynamics and prevents unrealistic zooplankton blooms.                                                                                                                                                            

Proposed Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Add quadratic (density-dependent) mortality for zooplankton to represent predation by higher trophic levels. This is ecologically justified because:                                                                        

 1 Predator-prey interactions are often proportional to both predator and prey densities                                                                                                                                    
 2 Quadratic closure is a standard approach in NPZ models to represent implicit higher trophic levels

 4 It creates more realistic oscillatory dynamics in plankton systems
