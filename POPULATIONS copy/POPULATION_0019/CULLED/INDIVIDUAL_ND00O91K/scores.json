  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the standard NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality) but uses different functional forms in key places. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten formulation (no explicit light limitation term present), grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH, and zooplankton mortality includes an additional quadratic term not present in TRUTH. The candidate also omits the environmental mixing/dilution term present in TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton. Overall the model is ecologically plausible and matches several alternate families from the literature rather than being algebraically identical to TRUTH.",
