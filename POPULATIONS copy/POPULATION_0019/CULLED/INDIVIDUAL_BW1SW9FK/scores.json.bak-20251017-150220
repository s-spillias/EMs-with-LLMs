  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N, P, Z) with nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality and recycling. However, several mechanistic choices differ from the TRUTH Python model: the candidate adds an explicit light limitation computed from Beer\u2013Lambert attenuation and mixed-layer averaging (self-shading via k_c and depth H), uses Monod/Holling-II style functional responses (N/(K_N+N) and P/(K_Z+P)) rather than the TRUTH's (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) saturating forms, and aggregates recycling from mortality rather than using the TRUTH's grazing-derived recycling terms. The candidate also omits the TRUTH environmental mixing/dilution term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and phytoplankton. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but often via alternate, literature-standard formulations; a few exact TRUTH structures are matched (linear phytoplankton mortality), while key TRUTH terms (mixing) are missing.",
