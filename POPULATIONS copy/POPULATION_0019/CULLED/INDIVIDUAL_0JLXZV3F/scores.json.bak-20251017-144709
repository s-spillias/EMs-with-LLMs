  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard nutrient\u2013phytoplankton\u2013zooplankton (NPZ) flow: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten), phytoplankton loss by linear mortality and Holling Type II grazing, zooplankton growth from grazing with an assimilation efficiency, and recycling from organismal mortalities. Major differences vs the TRUTH model: (1) uptake/grazing functional forms differ \u2014 candidate uses Monod uptake and Holling Type II grazing while TRUTH uses a combined N/(e+N) times a/(b+cP) term and a Type\u2011III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) grazing; (2) the candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (TRUTH has k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P), and it does not include recycling of unassimilated grazing explicitly (TRUTH includes grazing-related recycling terms). The candidate also introduces an explicit phytoplankton \u201cefficiency\u201d (epsilon_P_bounded) that decouples uptake from biomass production (TRUTH couples them 1:1). Numerical integration (Euler) and statistical/prior machinery are modelling choices but not ecological processes.",
