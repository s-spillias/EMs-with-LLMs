  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with different functional choices and extra processes. Uptake is implemented as multiplicative Monod (nutrient) \u00d7 saturating light limitation (explicit I_avg/MLD), grazing is Holling type II (P/(K_Z+P)), and mortality terms are linear. The candidate omits the explicit mixing/entrainment term present in the TRUTH nutrient equation, and it implements recycling only from mortality (gamma_P_bounded * P_loss + gamma_Z_bounded * Z_loss) rather than the TRUTH's combination of recycling from predation/excretion and direct recycling terms. Important extras in the candidate are explicit light/MLD self\u2011shading and irradiance averaging, an explicit phytoplankton assimilation efficiency that scales uptake, and temperature dependence via Q10 multipliers applied to rates.",
