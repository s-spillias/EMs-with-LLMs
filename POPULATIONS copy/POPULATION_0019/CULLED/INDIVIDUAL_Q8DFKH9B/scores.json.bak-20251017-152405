  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth \u2192 mortalities \u2192 recycling) but uses different functional forms and some extra processes compared to the TRUTH Python NPZ. Uptake/growth in the candidate is a multiplicative Monod (nutrient) \u00d7 saturating light formulation with explicit mixed-layer light averaging and Q10 temperature modifiers. Grazing is implemented as Holling Type II (vs. the TRUTH's Type\u2011III P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). Recycling in the candidate comes from linear mortalities (with bounded recycling fractions) rather than explicit unassimilated grazing/recycling terms from predation present in TRUTH. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment nutrient source term present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate follows canonical ecological roles but uses alternate (literature-consistent) functional forms and adds explicit light and temperature processes.",

TRUTH recycles from predation/unassimilated grazing and zooplankton processes '(beta * lambda_ * P^2/(mu^2 + P^2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z', so candidate includes recycling but from different sources (mortality-based recycling rather than explicit unassimilated grazing term)."
