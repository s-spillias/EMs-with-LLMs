  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 zooplankton grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model in several key places. Uptake in the candidate is Michaelis-Menten for nutrients combined multiplicatively with an explicit light limitation (Steele photoinhibition) and self-shading via k_total and MLD, whereas the TRUTH model uses a nutrient-only uptake term with a phytoplankton-dependent denominator a/(b + c P) and no light limitation. Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (P/(K_Z+P)) while TRUTH uses a saturating quadratic-like form P^2/(mu^2 + P^2). Recycling in the candidate comes from linear mortalities of P and Z (gamma_P*m_P*P + gamma_Z*m_Z*Z) rather than predation-derived recycling terms used in TRUTH. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH for nutrients (k*(N0 - N)) and omits explicit P and Z mixing. The code also includes non-ecological modeling items (soft parameter priors, observation-error modeling, logistic bounding of efficiencies) and uses forward Euler integration rather than the ODE solver used in TRUTH.",
