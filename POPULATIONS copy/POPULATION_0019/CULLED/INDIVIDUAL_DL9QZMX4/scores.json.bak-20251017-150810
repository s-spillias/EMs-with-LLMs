  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure but differs from the TRUTH model in key mechanistic choices. Both models have nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and linear mortalities. However the candidate uses a multiplicative Monod (N/(K+N)) \u00d7 Steele photoinhibition light function for phytoplankton growth and a Holling Type II grazing (g_max * P/(K_Z+P) * Z), whereas the TRUTH uses a nutrient term N/(e+N) combined with an a/(b + c*P) modifier and a P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) predation kernel. The candidate recycles nutrients from linear mortality of P and Z (gamma_P_bounded * P_loss + gamma_Z_bounded * Z_loss) and applies assimilation efficiencies (epsilon_P_bounded, epsilon_Z_bounded). The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and the explicit mixing loss on P ((s+k)*P) present in TRUTH. Additional explicit processes in the candidate are (1) Steele photoinhibition light limitation with explicit light attenuation by phytoplankton, (2) an explicit phytoplankton assimilation/uptake efficiency parameter (epsilon_P), and (3) separate recycling fractions for P and Z mortalities (gamma_P_bounded and gamma_Z_bounded).",
