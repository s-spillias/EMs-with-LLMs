MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Implements flexible co-limitation framework (harmonic mean with theta parameter)
2. Includes light attenuation with phytoplankton self-shading
3. Differential recycling rates for phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality
4. Proper numerical safeguards against division by zero

Weaknesses:
1. Several efficiency parameters initialized as placeholders (epsilon_P, epsilon_Z, gamma_P, gamma_Z all = 0.0)
2. Surface light intensity (I_0 = 886 W m^-2) is unrealistically high for oceanic conditions
3. Missing temperature dependence - a critical driver of plankton metabolic rates
4. No seasonal forcing or environmental variability

Parameter Value Concerns:
- Efficiency parameters at 0.0 will transform to 0.5 via logistic function, which may not reflect literature values
- High I_0 value suggests either data quality issues or need for recalibration
- Static rates don't capture seasonal or spatial variation in plankton dynamics

=== KEY MISSING ECOLOGICAL PROCESS ===

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF METABOLIC RATES

Rationale:
Temperature is arguably the most important environmental driver of plankton dynamics after light and nutrients. It affects:

1. Phytoplankton growth rates: Q10 typically 1.5-2.5, with growth doubling every 10°C increase
2. Zooplankton grazing rates: Q10 typically 2.0-3.0, strongly temperature-dependent
3. Mortality and respiration: Generally increase exponentially with temperature
4. Seasonal bloom dynamics: Spring blooms triggered by warming + stratification
5. Geographic patterns: Productivity gradients from polar to tropical regions
6. Climate change impacts: Warming alters plankton phenology and community structure

The Arrhenius equation provides a mechanistically-based temperature dependence:
rate(T) = rate_ref × exp(-E_a/R × (1/T - 1/T_ref))

Where:
- E_a = activation energy (J mol^-1), typically 30,000-70,000 for biological processes
- R = universal gas constant (8.314 J mol^-1 K^-1)
- T = absolute temperature (Kelvin)
- T_ref = reference temperature (Kelvin), typically 288-293 K (15-20°C)

=== PROPOSED MODIFICATION ===

Add temperature-dependent rate modifiers to:
1. Phytoplankton maximum growth rate (r_P)
2. Zooplankton maximum grazing rate (g_max)
3. Phytoplankton mortality rate (m_P)
4. Zooplankton mortality rate (m_Z)

Implementation approach:
- Add activation energy parameters for each process (E_a_P, E_a_Z, E_a_mP, E_a_mZ)
- Add reference temperature parameter (T_ref)
- Compute temperature-dependent rate multipliers using Arrhenius equation
- Apply multipliers to base rates in differential equations
- Temperature data can be added later; currently T = T_ref (no temperature effect)

Parameter additions:
- E_a_P: Activation energy for phytoplankton growth (40,000-65,000 J mol^-1)
- E_a_Z: Activation energy for zooplankton grazing (50,000-70,000 J mol^-1)
- E_a_mP: Activation energy for phytoplankton mortality (30,000-50,000 J mol^-1)
- E_a_mZ: Activation energy for zooplankton mortality (30,000-50,000 J mol^-1)
- T_ref: Reference temperature (typically 288.15 K = 15°C for temperate oceans)

Current implementation:
- Temperature is set to T_ref (constant), so all temperature modifiers = 1.0
- This maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- Framework is ready for temperature forcing when data becomes available
- Activation energy parameters can be estimated even without temperature variation

Expected improvements (when temperature data is added):
1. Capture seasonal variation in plankton dynamics
2. Better represent spring bloom timing and magnitude
3. Improve model realism for different oceanic regions
4. Enable climate change scenario testing
5. Reduce residuals during periods of strong temperature variation

Ecological justification:
Temperature dependence is well-established in plankton ecology through decades of laboratory experiments, field observations, and theoretical work. The Arrhenius formulation is preferred over Q10 because:
- More mechanistically grounded (based on chemical kinetics)
- Better extrapolation beyond calibration range
- Consistent with metabolic theory of ecology
- Widely used in marine biogeochemical models (e.g., NPZD, DARWIN, PISCES)

This modification maintains model parsimony while adding the structural framework for temperature dependence. The model currently runs with T = T_ref (no temperature effect), but is ready to incorporate temperature forcing when appropriate data becomes available. The activation energy parameters provide information about the temperature sensitivity of different processes even in the absence of temperature variation in the current dataset.
