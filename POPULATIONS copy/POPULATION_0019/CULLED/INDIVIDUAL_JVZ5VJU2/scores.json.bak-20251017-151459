  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and linear mortalities) but uses different functional forms in several places compared with the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth in the candidate is a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) nutrient term combined with an explicit light limitation (I_avg/(K_I+I_avg)) and a flexible co-limitation harmonic-mean (theta) formulation \u2014 an alternate to the TRUTH multiplicative N/(e+N) \u00d7 a/(b + c P) form. Grazing is Holling II (P/(K_Z+P)), whereas TRUTH uses a sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. Recycling in the candidate is implemented only as remineralization of linear mortalities (\"recycling = gamma_P_bounded * P_loss + gamma_Z_bounded * Z_loss\") rather than including explicit unassimilated grazing or predation-related recycling as in TRUTH. The candidate omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt and dP/dt present in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and (s+k)*P). Extra ecological processes in the candidate include explicit temperature dependence via Arrhenius modifiers, an explicit mixed-layer light averaging with MLD and self-shading (k_w + k_p*P), and a flexible harmonic co-limitation (theta) formulation.",
