  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient \u2192 phytoplankton \u2192 zooplankton) with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation for growth, a Holling type-II grazing function, linear phytoplankton mortality, and both linear and quadratic zooplankton mortality. These correspond to the same ecological roles in the TRUTH model but differ in functional forms and in some missing/extra processes: the candidate omits the TRUTH model's explicit mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton, and replaces the TRUTH phytoplankton light-dependence / sigmoidal grazing (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) by simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten and Holling II forms. The candidate also includes quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality (an extra process not present in TRUTH). Numerical implementation (Euler stepping) and parameter-penalty machinery are modeling choices rather than new ecological processes.",

In the nutrient equation dN/dt the uptake appears as '-phyto_growth' ('Type dN_dt = -phyto_growth + nutrient_recycling;'). This matches the general Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake family (alternative to the TRUTH combined nutrient+light term)."
