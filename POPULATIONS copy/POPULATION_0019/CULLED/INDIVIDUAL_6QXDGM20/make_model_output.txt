 4 Nutrient recycling is complete and instantaneous                                                                                                                                                                         

Missing Ecological Realism:                                                                                                                                                                                                 

The most significant oversimplification is the linear zooplankton mortality. In real oceanic systems, zooplankton experience density-dependent mortality due to:                                                            

 • Predation by higher trophic levels (increases with zooplankton density)                                                                                                                                                  
 • Cannibalism at high densities                                                                                                                                                                                            
 • Disease transmission (density-dependent)                                                                                                                                                                                 

This is typically represented as quadratic (density-dependent) mortality, which is well-established in plankton ecology and creates more realistic predator-prey dynamics, preventing unrealistic zooplankton blooms.       


                                                                                                    Proposed Improvement                                                                                                    

I will replace the linear zooplankton mortality with a quadratic (density-dependent) mortality term. This adds ecological realism by representing:                                                                          

 • Higher trophic level predation that increases with prey availability                                                                                                                                                     
 • Intraspecific interactions at high densities                                                                                                                                                                             
 • More stable oscillatory dynamics                                                                                                                                                                                         

The change: m_Z * Z → m_Z * Z + m_Z2 * Z²                                                                                                                                                                                   

This is a well-justified ecological improvement that better captures real plankton dynamics without over-complicating the model.
