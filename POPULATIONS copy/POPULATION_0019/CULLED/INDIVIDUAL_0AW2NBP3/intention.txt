MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system with:
- Flexible co-limitation between nutrients and light (theta parameter)
- Self-shading effects via phytoplankton biomass
- Differential recycling rates for detritus
- Bounded efficiency parameters

IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
1. Missing temperature dependence - a critical driver of oceanic plankton dynamics
2. Unrealistic I_0 parameter value (886 W m^-2 is far above typical oceanic PAR of 50-400 W m^-2)
3. Linear mortality terms don't capture density-dependent effects
4. No seasonal environmental forcing despite mixed layer systems showing strong seasonality

PARAMETER VALUE CONCERNS:
- I_0 = 886.0 W m^-2 with extremely tight bounds suggests overfitting
- This value is 2-4x higher than realistic oceanic surface PAR
- May indicate compensating for missing temperature effects or other processes

CHOSEN IMPROVEMENT: Temperature-Dependent Rate Modulation (Framework)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
Temperature is a master variable controlling metabolic rates in ectothermic plankton:
- Phytoplankton growth rates typically double per 10°C (Q10 ≈ 2-3)
- Zooplankton grazing and metabolism show similar temperature sensitivity
- Mortality rates (respiration, excretion) also increase with temperature
- Mixed layer temperature varies seasonally (e.g., 5-25°C in temperate oceans)
- This variation drives bloom dynamics, succession, and ecosystem productivity

MATHEMATICAL APPROACH:
Implement Q10-based temperature dependence using the standard formulation:
  rate(T) = rate_ref * Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)

Where:
- T = mixed layer temperature (°C) - from oceanographic data or climatology
- T_ref = reference temperature (typically 15°C for temperate systems)
- Q10 = temperature coefficient (typically 1.5-3.0 for biological rates)

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
1. Added Q10 parameters for different process groups:
   - Q10_growth: affects phytoplankton growth (r_P)
   - Q10_grazing: affects zooplankton grazing (g_max)
   - Q10_mortality: affects both mortality rates (m_P, m_Z)
2. Temperature correction framework implemented in model code
3. Currently uses constant temperature (T_ref) as placeholder
4. Framework ready for temporal temperature data when available

CURRENT STATUS:
The model now includes the temperature dependence framework with Q10 parameters.
Since temporal temperature data (T_water) is not yet available, the model currently
uses a constant temperature equal to T_ref. This means temperature correction factors
are all 1.0, so the model behaves identically to the previous version but with the
infrastructure in place for temperature variation.

When temperature time series data becomes available:
- Replace "Type T_current = T_ref;" with "Type T_current = T_water(i);"
- Add T_water as DATA_VECTOR in the model
- The Q10 parameters will then modulate rates based on actual temperature variation

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS (when temperature data is added):
- Captures seasonal dynamics driven by temperature variation
- Reduces need for unrealistically high light intensity to fit data
- More mechanistically realistic representation of metabolic processes
- Better predictive capability across different temperature regimes
- Maintains model parsimony (adds 4 parameters but captures major environmental driver)

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES CONSIDERED:
- Quadratic mortality (density dependence): Less critical than temperature for mixed layer systems
- Nutrient recycling temperature dependence: Important but secondary to rate effects
- Multiple nutrient limitation: Adds complexity without addressing main gap
- Zooplankton closure terms: Relevant but temperature is more fundamental

Temperature dependence is the most ecologically justified addition given:
1. Strong empirical support for Q10 relationships in plankton
2. Explains seasonal patterns in NPZ systems
3. Well-constrained parameter ranges from literature
4. Relatively simple mathematical implementation
5. Addresses potential overfitting in light parameters
