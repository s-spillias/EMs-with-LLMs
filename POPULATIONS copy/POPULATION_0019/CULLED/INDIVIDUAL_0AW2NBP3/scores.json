  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ roles (resource-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, linear mortalities) but uses different mechanistic forms for many terms. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) uptake combined with an explicit, flexible nutrient\u00d7light co-limitation (harmonic-mean style), rather than the TRUTH's specific composite form (N/(e+N) * a/(b + cP) * P). Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_Z+P)) instead of the TRUTH's sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2). The candidate also adds explicit ecological processes not in TRUTH: explicit light-depth averaging with self-shading (I_avg, k_w, k_p, MLD), a flexible co-limitation exponent theta, and Q10 temperature modifiers on biological rates, plus an explicit phytoplankton assimilation/uptake efficiency. Some TRUTH components are missing in the candidate (notably nutrient mixing/entrainment and phytoplankton physical mixing). Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and maps to literature alternates for many pieces, but it is not a direct algebraic match to the TRUTH model.",
