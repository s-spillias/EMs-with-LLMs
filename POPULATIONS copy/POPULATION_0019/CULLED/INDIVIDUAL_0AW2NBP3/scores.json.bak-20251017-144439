  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth, grazing -> zooplankton growth, linear mortalities) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH model for several components. Uptake and growth follow Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light limitation and a harmonic-mean co-limitation (theta) rather than the TRUTH model's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) functional form. Grazing is implemented as Holling Type II (P/(K_Z+P)) rather than the TRUTH model's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (a Type-III/sigmoidal form). Zooplankton growth (assimilation * grazing) and linear mortality terms are implemented in the canonical way and match the TRUTH structure. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/dilution term present in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and mixing losses on P). The candidate also adds several ecological processes not present in TRUTH: explicit light limitation with self-shading and mixed-layer averaging, a flexible co-limitation (harmonic mean, theta), temperature dependence via Q10 modifiers on rates, and an explicit phytoplankton uptake/assimilation efficiency (epsilon_P).",
