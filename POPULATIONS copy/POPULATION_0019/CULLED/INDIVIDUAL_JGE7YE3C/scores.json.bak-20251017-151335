  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard discrete-time NPZ but uses simpler/alternative functional forms than the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are classic Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation (no predator-dependent term present). Grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a Hill/type-III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) in TRUTH. Recycling is present in the candidate via mortality and the inefficient-assimilation term (1-e)*grazing, which corresponds functionally to TRUTH's recycled grazing and mortality terms but with different parameterization. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term that appears in TRUTH's nutrient equation (k*(N0-N)) and omits explicit mixing loss for P. The candidate also contains non-ecological extras (observation likelihood, parameter penalties, Euler integration), not counted as ecological components.",
