  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements a standard Monod-type nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Michaelis-Menten uptake), Holling Type II grazing with an assimilation efficiency, linear mortality for P and Z, and explicit recycling of mortality and unassimilated grazing back to the nutrient pool. It lacks the TRUTH model's light/self-shading limitation on phytoplankton (the a/(b + c*P) factor) and it omits the environmental mixing/entrainment terms present for N and P in the TRUTH model. The candidate matches TRUTH in having linear phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality and in representing zooplankton growth as assimilation of grazing, but uses alternate functional forms for uptake and grazing (Monod and Holling II rather than the TRUTH's composite N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) and P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating grazing). The candidate also includes an observation likelihood and numerical safeguards (Euler integration, non-negativity enforcement) which are modeling/estimation features rather than new ecological processes.",
