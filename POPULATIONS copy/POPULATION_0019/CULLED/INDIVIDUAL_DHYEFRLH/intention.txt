ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:

The current NPZ model implements basic plankton dynamics with nutrient limitation (Monod kinetics), 
zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II), linear mortality, and nutrient recycling. The parameter values 
from literature are ecologically reasonable:
- Phytoplankton efficiency ~69% (epsilon_P logit = 0.8)
- Zooplankton efficiency ~40% (epsilon_Z logit = -0.4)  
- Nutrient recycling ~50% (gamma logit = 0.0)

IDENTIFIED GAP:

The model currently only considers nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth, but in oceanic mixed 
layers, phytoplankton are typically co-limited by BOTH nutrients AND light. Light availability is a 
fundamental driver of primary production and varies with:
1. Surface light intensity (seasonal/daily variation)
2. Mixed layer depth (determines average light exposure)
3. Phytoplankton biomass (self-shading effect)

PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:

Add light limitation with self-shading to phytoplankton growth dynamics. This improvement:

1. Makes growth co-limited by nutrients AND light (multiplicative limitation)
2. Includes self-shading feedback where high phytoplankton biomass reduces light availability
3. Captures realistic bloom dynamics and seasonal patterns
4. Represents a fundamental process in oceanic mixed layer ecology

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Light limitation factor: I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)
where I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-k_w * H - k_p * P * H)) / (k_w * H + k_p * P * H)

This represents:
- I_0: surface light intensity (new parameter)
- k_w: background light attenuation by water (new parameter)
- k_p: specific light attenuation by phytoplankton (new parameter)
- H: mixed layer depth (new parameter)
- K_I: half-saturation constant for light (new parameter)
- I_avg: depth-averaged light in mixed layer

The phytoplankton growth equation becomes:
uptake = r_P * (N/(K_N + N)) * (I_avg/(K_I + I_avg)) * P

This creates ecologically important feedbacks:
- High P → more self-shading → reduced I_avg → slower growth
- Deep mixed layer → lower I_avg → light limitation even with high nutrients
- Seasonal light variation → realistic bloom timing

PARAMETERS ADDED:

1. I_0: Surface light intensity (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
   - Typical range: 0-2000, seasonal average ~500-1000
   - Initial value: 800 (moderate light conditions)

2. K_I: Half-saturation for light (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
   - Typical range: 20-100 for marine phytoplankton
   - Initial value: 50 (mid-range value)

3. k_w: Background water attenuation (m^-1)
   - Typical range: 0.02-0.2 for clear to coastal waters
   - Initial value: 0.04 (clear oceanic water)

4. k_p: Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (m^2 g^-1 C)
   - Typical range: 0.01-0.1
   - Initial value: 0.03 (moderate self-shading)

5. H: Mixed layer depth (m)
   - Typical range: 10-200m depending on season/location
   - Initial value: 50 (moderate mixed layer)

ECOLOGICAL REALISM:

This modification maintains the existing model structure while adding a critical process that:
- Is well-established in plankton ecology literature
- Creates realistic density-dependent feedbacks
- Explains bloom dynamics and seasonal patterns
- Represents actual physical constraints in the mixed layer
- Uses standard mathematical formulations from marine ecology

The improvement transforms the model from nutrient-only limitation to realistic co-limitation, 
significantly enhancing its ability to capture oceanic mixed layer plankton dynamics.
