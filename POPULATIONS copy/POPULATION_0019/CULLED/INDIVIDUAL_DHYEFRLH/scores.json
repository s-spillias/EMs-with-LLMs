  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, and recycling) but uses different functional forms in several places. Phytoplankton growth is implemented as co-limitation by an explicit, mechanistic light-limitation (depth-averaged irradiance with water + self-shading attenuation) multiplied by a Michaelis-Menten nutrient term (an alternate to the TRUTH a/(b+cP) \u00d7 N/(e+N) formulation). Grazing and zooplankton growth use a Holling-type Monod (P/(K_Z+P)) functional response (an alternate to the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Linear mortality terms match the TRUTH. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton, and it recycles only a fraction of P_loss and Z_loss rather than including the TRUTH's grazing-derived recycling terms.",
