  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ structure with all three state variables and the usual ecological roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, recycling, zooplankton growth and mortality). However, the mathematical formulations differ from the TRUTH model in important ways: uptake is implemented as a product of a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term and an explicit depth-averaged light limitation (I_avg/(K_I + I_avg)), rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) times a/(b + c*P) formulation. Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_Z + P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) saturating form. Mortality terms are linear in both models (and match). The candidate omits an explicit mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt and dP/dt present in the TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and the k*P mixing component). Recycling in the candidate comes from P_loss and Z_loss (dead biomass) via a single recycling fraction, whereas TRUTH includes recycling from grazing/unassimilated predation terms and separate zooplankton recycling terms. The candidate also includes modeling/estimation machinery (observation-error parameters, priors/penalties, forward Euler integration) that are not ecological processes in the TRUTH simulation.",

TRUTH uptake is \"(N/(e+N)) * (a/(b + c * P)) * P\".
