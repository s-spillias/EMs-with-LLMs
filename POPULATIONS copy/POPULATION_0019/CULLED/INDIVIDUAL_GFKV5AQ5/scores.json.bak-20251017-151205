  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with biologically plausible uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling terms, but differs from the TRUTH NPZ in several mechanistic choices. Key differences: uptake is Michaelis-Menten with an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert averaged over a mixed layer) rather than the TRUTH's nutrient-term combined with a phytoplankton-dependent uptake modifier; grazing is Holling type II (g*P/(K_P+P)*Z) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form; recycling is handled via explicit mortality and excretion terms (including a quadratic zooplankton mortality) rather than the TRUTH's predation-derived recycling terms and simple linear zooplankton loss; the candidate also omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in the TRUTH model. Several of the candidate's processes match literature alternates (Michaelis-Menten uptake, Holling II grazing, linear and quadratic mortality, explicit excretion), while exact structural matches to the TRUTH model are limited to phytoplankton linear mortality.",
