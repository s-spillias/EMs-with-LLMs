  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the canonical blocks (uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) but many terms differ in mathematical form from the TRUTH reference. Uptake/growth in the candidate is a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert averaged irradiance), rather than the TRUTH's (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P))*P form. Grazing is a Holling type II (P/(K_P+P)) form (an alternate in the literature) instead of the TRUTH's quadratic/saturating P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response. Recycling is represented as fractions of explicit mortality and an excretion term, rather than the TRUTH's predation-linked recycling terms. The candidate omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms for N, P, and Z that appear in TRUTH (e.g., k*(N0-N) and -(s+k)*P). The candidate also introduces explicit light physics (I_0, k_w, k_p, H, I_avg, L), an excretion flux (delta*Z), and quadratic zooplankton mortality (m_Z2*Z^2) that are not present in TRUTH. Many candidate processes match documented alternates from the literature (Michaelis\u2013Menten + light limitation; Holling II grazing; linear and quadratic mortality), but they are not exact structural matches to the TRUTH formulas.",
