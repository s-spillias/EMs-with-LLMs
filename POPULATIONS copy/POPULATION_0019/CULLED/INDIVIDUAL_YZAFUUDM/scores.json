  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 zooplankton grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) using Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) uptake, Holling Type II grazing, linear mortalities, and a simple remineralization of mortalities. It differs from the TRUTH model in three main ways: (1) uptake is a simple Monod term without the P-dependent light limitation factor used in TRUTH, (2) recycling is implemented only from linear mortality (P_loss + Z_loss) rather than from non-assimilated grazing and multiple recycling pathways in TRUTH, and (3) there is no environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N)) present. The candidate also introduces an explicit phytoplankton assimilation efficiency on uptake (epsilon_P_bounded) which is not present in the TRUTH equations. Numerical and statistical features (Euler integration, observation error and priors) are present but are modeling/estimation elements, not ecological processes.",
