MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing NPZ model implements standard ecological processes:
- Nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Monod kinetics)
- Zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II)
- Linear mortality and nutrient recycling

Parameter values are ecologically reasonable:
- Growth rates (r_P=0.6, g_max=0.5 day^-1) are typical for marine systems
- Efficiencies are appropriately bounded (epsilon_P~69%, epsilon_Z~40%)
- Half-saturation constants (K_N=0.1, K_Z=0.2 g C m^-3) are realistic

MODEL STATUS:
The model has been reverted to the original nutrient-only limitation structure due to data availability constraints. Light limitation was initially proposed but requires additional data (surface light intensity, mixed layer depth) that is not currently available in the dataset.

ORIGINAL IMPROVEMENT CONCEPT (for future implementation):
Light limitation is a fundamental driver of phytoplankton growth in oceanic mixed layers. When light data becomes available, the model could be enhanced with:

Growth = r_P * [N/(K_N + N)] * [I/(K_I + I)] * P

Where:
- I = surface light intensity attenuated through the mixed layer
- K_I = half-saturation constant for light-limited growth (~20-50 W m^-2)
- Light attenuation: I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-k_w * MLD)) / (k_w * MLD)
- k_w = light attenuation coefficient (~0.05-0.2 m^-1)
- MLD = mixed layer depth (m)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:
1. Light is co-limiting with nutrients in marine systems (Liebig's Law of the Minimum)
2. Captures seasonal bloom dynamics driven by light-nutrient interactions
3. Explains why deep mixing can suppress phytoplankton growth despite nutrient availability
4. Would improve representation of seasonal variability in phytoplankton production

CURRENT MODEL STRUCTURE:
The model maintains the classic NPZ formulation with:
- Monod nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth
- Holling Type II functional response for zooplankton grazing
- Linear mortality terms for both trophic levels
- Nutrient recycling from dead organic matter
- Logit-transformed efficiency parameters to ensure biological realism (0-1 bounds)

This structure provides a solid foundation for understanding nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics and can be enhanced when additional environmental data becomes available.
