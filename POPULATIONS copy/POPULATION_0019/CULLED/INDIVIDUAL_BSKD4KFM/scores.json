  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient uptake and a Holling type II grazing model embedded in an Euler-forward ODE integrator with linear mortality and explicit recycling of mortality. It therefore captures many canonical roles (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, linear mortality) but differs from the TRUTH NPZ in three key ways: (1) the TRUTH uses a more complex grazing/consumption functional form (P^2/(mu^2+P^2), i.e. Holling-III/threshold-like) while the candidate uses Holling-II (P/(K_Z+P)); (2) recycling in TRUTH largely derives from predation/grazing terms, whereas the candidate recycles only mortality losses (P_loss + Z_loss) and omits recycling of unassimilated grazing; (3) the TRUTH includes an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt (k*(N0 - N)) and a phytoplankton mixing/loss term ((s+k)*P) that are absent in the candidate. The candidate also introduces an explicit phytoplankton assimilation/uptake efficiency (epsilon_P_bounded) that is not present in the TRUTH formulation.",
