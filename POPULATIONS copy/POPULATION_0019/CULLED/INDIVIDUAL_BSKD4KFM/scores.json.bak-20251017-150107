  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten), Holling Type II grazing, linear (first-order) mortality for P and Z, and recycling of mortality back to nutrients. It differs from the TRUTH model in three main ways: (1) the TRUTH model uses a more complex uptake term that combines N-Monod and an a/(b + c P) term (and a P^2-based grazing functional response), while the candidate uses a simpler N-Monod times P growth; (2) TRUTH includes explicit mixing/entrainment in dN/dt (k*(N0 - N)) which the candidate omits; (3) recycling pathways are formulated differently \u2014 TRUTH recycles from predation/excretion terms (beta*lambda*...*Z and gamma*q*Z), whereas the candidate recycles a fraction of P- and Z-mortality. The candidate also includes an explicit phytoplankton assimilation/uptake efficiency (epsilon_P_bounded) that is not present in the TRUTH equations. Overall the candidate matches canonical ecological roles but uses alternate functional forms for uptake/grazing and omits environmental mixing.",
