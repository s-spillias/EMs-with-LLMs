  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the main NPZ processes: nutrient-limited phytoplankton uptake (Monod), light limitation (explicit, with self-shading and mixed-layer averaging), Holling-type grazing, linear phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality, recycling from mortalities, and zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing. Compared with the TRUTH NPZ, the candidate matches the ecological roles of uptake, grazing, mortality, and recycling but uses alternate functional forms for several terms (Monod nutrient uptake \u00d7 explicit light Monod vs TRUTH's N/(e+N) \u00d7 a/(b+cP), Holling II grazing vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating predation). The candidate is missing an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton that appears in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and mixing in P). The candidate also introduces explicit light limitation (I_avg, self-shading via k_p and MLD) and an explicit phytoplankton conversion/assimilation efficiency (epsilon_P_bounded) that are not present in TRUTH. Implementation-level statistical components (observation error, priors, Euler integration) are present but are not counted as ecological extra components.",
