  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, recycling, and zooplankton growth/mortality) but with different functional choices than the TRUTH Python model. Key differences: the candidate uses multiplicative Monod-type nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light\u2011limitation submodel (depth-averaged irradiance with self-shading) and Holling Type II grazing, whereas TRUTH uses a Monod-like N term combined with an a/(b + c*P) term and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Hill-type) predation response plus an explicit mixing/dilution term k*(N0-N) that is absent in the candidate. Both models use linear mortality for P and Z, and both include recycling, but the candidate's recycling is explicitly from mortality terms (gamma_P_bounded * P_loss + gamma_Z_bounded * Z_loss) and the candidate also separates assimilation efficiencies (epsilon_P_bounded, epsilon_Z_bounded). Overall the candidate matches many ecological roles but several canonical terms are implemented as alternates (Monod + light, Holling II) and one canonical TRUTH component (environmental mixing of nutrients) is missing. The candidate also adds an explicit light/optics component not present in TRUTH.",
