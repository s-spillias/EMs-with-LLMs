  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard Monod/Holling NPZ structure but differs in specific functional forms and some processes relative to the TRUTH Python NPZ. Key matches: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are multiplicative Monod-style with an added explicit light limitation (depth-averaged I) and zooplankton growth is grazing-driven with assimilation efficiency. Key differences: the candidate uses a Holling II grazing law (P/(K_Z+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (type-III), recycles nutrients from linear mortality terms rather than explicitly from grazing/predation egestion terms, and omits the environmental mixing/dilution term present in TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton. The candidate also adds an explicit light attenuation/self-shading + mixed-layer averaging process not present in the TRUTH equations.",
