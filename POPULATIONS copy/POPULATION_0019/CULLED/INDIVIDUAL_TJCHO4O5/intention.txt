NPZ Model: Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton Dynamics in the Oceanic Mixed Layer

This model simulates the coupled dynamics of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z) in a marine pelagic ecosystem. The model captures key ecological processes:

1. NUTRIENT UPTAKE: Phytoplankton take up dissolved nutrients following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, representing saturating uptake at high nutrient concentrations.

2. PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH: Primary production is limited by both nutrient availability (via uptake) and light. Growth follows a saturating response to nutrients with a maximum growth rate.

3. GRAZING: Zooplankton consume phytoplankton following a Holling Type II functional response, which captures prey-dependent feeding saturation. Only a fraction of consumed phytoplankton is assimilated into zooplankton biomass (grazing efficiency).

4. MORTALITY AND RECYCLING: 
   - Phytoplankton experience natural mortality, with a portion of dead biomass recycled back to the nutrient pool
   - Zooplankton experience density-dependent mortality (quadratic term representing predation/starvation)
   - Zooplankton excretion returns nutrients to the dissolved pool

5. NUTRIENT CYCLING: The model closes the nutrient loop through remineralization of dead organic matter and zooplankton excretion, maintaining mass balance in the system.

The model represents a simplified but mechanistically sound representation of lower trophic level marine ecosystems, suitable for understanding bloom dynamics, seasonal cycles, and responses to nutrient enrichment.
