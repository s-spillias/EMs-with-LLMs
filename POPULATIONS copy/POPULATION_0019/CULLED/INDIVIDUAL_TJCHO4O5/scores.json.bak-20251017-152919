  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the basic NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth and grazing losses, zooplankton growth and mortality) but uses different mathematical choices than the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a Monod/Michaelis-Menten type term (r * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH's multiplicative nutrient \u00d7 light limitation (N/(e+N) * a/(b+cP) * P). Grazing is a Holling Type II (g * P/(K_P+P) * Z) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2)-type functional response. The candidate includes recycling via mortality and an explicit excretion term added to nutrients, but it does not include the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N)) or an explicit immediate nutrient return from grazing (i.e., no (1-e)*grazing -> N). The candidate also adds quadratic zooplankton mortality and an explicit excretion parameter\u2014processes not present in the TRUTH equations. Numerically the candidate uses forward Euler integration and statistical components (observation error, penalties) absent from the TRUTH ODE definition.",
