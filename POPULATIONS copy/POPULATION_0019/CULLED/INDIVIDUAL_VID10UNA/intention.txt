MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Monod kinetics for nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth
- Holling Type II functional response for zooplankton grazing
- Linear mortality terms for both plankton groups
- Nutrient recycling from dead organic matter

CRITICAL MISSING PROCESS - LIGHT LIMITATION:
For an oceanic mixed layer model, the absence of light limitation is a major ecological oversight. Phytoplankton are photosynthetic organisms that require both nutrients AND light for growth. In the ocean:
- Light intensity decreases exponentially with depth (Beer-Lambert Law)
- Mixed layer depth varies seasonally and affects average light availability
- Light can be the primary limiting factor, especially in nutrient-rich waters

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR LIGHT LIMITATION:
1. In many oceanic regions, phytoplankton blooms are triggered by increased light availability (spring stratification) rather than nutrient addition
2. Deep mixed layers in winter can light-limit phytoplankton even when nutrients are abundant
3. Light limitation explains the vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass
4. The interaction between nutrient and light limitation creates realistic seasonal dynamics

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
I will add light limitation using a depth-integrated approach:
- Surface light intensity (I_0) as a parameter
- Light attenuation coefficient (k_w for water + k_c for self-shading by phytoplankton)
- Mixed layer depth (MLD) as a parameter
- Average light availability calculated as depth-integrated photosynthetically available radiation
- Growth limited by MINIMUM of nutrient and light (Liebig's Law)

This creates a more realistic representation where:
- Deep mixing → low average light → reduced growth even with high nutrients
- Shallow mixing + high light → nutrient limitation dominates
- Self-shading by phytoplankton creates negative feedback on growth

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
- I_0: Surface light intensity (W m^-2 or μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
- k_w: Background light attenuation coefficient (m^-1)
- k_c: Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (m^2 g C^-1)
- MLD: Mixed layer depth (m)
- I_k: Light saturation parameter for phytoplankton (W m^-2)

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding a fundamental ecological process that is essential for realistic oceanic plankton dynamics.
