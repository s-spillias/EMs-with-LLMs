  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ model implements the canonical ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, phytoplankton growth and loss, zooplankton growth and mortality) but uses simpler/alternate functional forms than the TRUTH Python NPZ. Nutrient uptake in the candidate is a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) term feeding phytoplankton growth via an explicit phytoplankton assimilation efficiency; grazing is a Holling Type II (saturating) functional response; mortality terms are linear. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton present in TRUTH, and it lumps recycling as a fixed fraction of organismal mortality rather than the multi-term recycling/grazing partitioning used in TRUTH.",
