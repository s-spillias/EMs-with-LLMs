NPZ Plankton Population Model

This model simulates the coupled dynamics of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z) in the oceanic mixed layer. The model captures three key ecological processes:

1. Phytoplankton Growth: Phytoplankton take up dissolved nutrients using a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) saturating functional response, converting nutrients into biomass with efficiency epsilon_P. Growth is limited by nutrient availability.

2. Zooplankton Grazing: Zooplankton consume phytoplankton using a Holling Type II functional response with half-saturation constant K_Z, representing handling time limitations. Consumed phytoplankton is converted to zooplankton biomass with efficiency epsilon_Z.

3. Nutrient Recycling: Both phytoplankton and zooplankton experience mortality and metabolic losses. A fraction (gamma) of dead organic matter is remineralized back into the dissolved nutrient pool, completing the nutrient cycle. The remainder is lost from the system (e.g., sinking to deeper waters).

The model exhibits rich dynamics including oscillations and potential equilibria, depending on parameter values. It represents a minimal but mechanistically sound representation of lower trophic level marine ecosystems.
