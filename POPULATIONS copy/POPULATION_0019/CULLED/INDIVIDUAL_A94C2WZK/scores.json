  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core three-state NPZ dynamics (N, P, Z) with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, zooplankton grazing with assimilation, linear mortality, and recycling of mortality back to N. However its functional forms differ from the TRUTH in key ways: uptake/growth uses a single Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) nutrient limitation (no light/self-shading term present in TRUTH), grazing is Holling type II (TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form akin to Holling type III), recycling is a simple fraction of linear mortality (TRUTH has multiple recycling pathways including predation-derived remineralization terms), and the candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH. The candidate also adds a temperature/Q10 modifier (an extra ecological modifier) and implements observation/error and soft-prior machinery (modeling rather than ecological processes). Overall the candidate matches many ecological roles but several structural differences make it an ALTERNATE implementation for most canonical processes.",
