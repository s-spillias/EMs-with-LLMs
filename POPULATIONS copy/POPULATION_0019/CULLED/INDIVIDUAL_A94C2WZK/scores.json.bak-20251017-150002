  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the standard three-compartment structure (N, P, Z) with uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling terms, but uses different functional forms in several places compared with the TRUTH model. Key differences: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) form in N (candidate) vs. the TRUTH's composite N and P-dependent term; grazing uses a Holling Type II (candidate) vs. the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form; recycling in the candidate is aggregated from P and Z linear mortality only, whereas the TRUTH includes explicit recycling/excretion terms tied to grazing and specific mortality pathways; the candidate lacks an explicit mixing/entrainment term for N/P but adds an explicit temperature/Q10 modifier (although set to unity in the code). Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but often via alternate canonical formulations (Michaelis\u2013Menten, Holling II, linear mortality, simplified recycling).",
