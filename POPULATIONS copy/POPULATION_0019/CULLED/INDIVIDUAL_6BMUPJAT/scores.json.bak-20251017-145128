  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit Monod nutrient limitation, an explicit depth-averaged light limitation (self-shading via k_c and background attenuation k_w), Holling Type II grazing, linear mortality, and recycling from mortality and inefficient assimilation. Compared with the TRUTH NPZ, the candidate (1) uses a conventional Michaelis\u2013Menten/Monod uptake factor multiplied by an explicit light factor rather than the TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) term, (2) represents grazing and zooplankton growth with Holling II + assimilation efficiency instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response, and (3) omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt and dP/dt. The candidate therefore matches many canonical roles but uses alternate functional families for uptake, light limitation, and grazing. The candidate also introduces an explicit depth-integrated light process not present in the TRUTH code.",
