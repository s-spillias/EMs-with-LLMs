  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the canonical state variables N, P, Z and includes most core processes (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing, linear mortalities, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, and recycling). However the functional forms differ in important ways from the TRUTH: the candidate uses a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient term combined with an explicit light limitation (I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)) tied together by a harmonic-mean/co-limitation formulation (theta), and uses a Holling Type II grazing term rather than the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (the k*(N0 - N) and (s+k)*P terms in TRUTH). It also adds explicit temperature dependence (Q10) and an explicit depth-averaged light / self-shading formulation (I_avg, k_w, k_p, MLD) that are not present in TRUTH. Recycling in the candidate originates from mortality pools only (gamma_P * P_loss + gamma_Z * Z_loss) and does not explicitly return the unassimilated fraction of grazing to nutrients as in the TRUTH formulation.",
