  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) using common alternate functional forms from the literature: Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation factor, a Holling Type II grazing term, linear mortality, and recycling proportional to mortality. It departs from the TRUTH model in two important ways: (1) it omits the TRUTH-style mixing/dilution term k*(N0 - N) and instead uses a constant external input rate (N_input) with no explicit dilution, and (2) it adds an explicit irradiance/light limitation submodel (I_avg, light_limitation, self\u2011shading) that is not present in the TRUTH NPZ. Recycling from zooplankton is simplified (proportional to m_Z) rather than using predation-loss terms as in TRUTH. Overall the candidate aligns well with standard alternate formulations (Michaelis-Menten + Monod-like light limitation, Holling II grazing, linear mortality) but does not exactly match the TRUTH algebraic forms for several terms and is missing explicit mixing for N and P.",
