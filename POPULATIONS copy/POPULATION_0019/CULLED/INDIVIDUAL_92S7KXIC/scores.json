  "qualitative_description": "The candidate implements a biologically detailed NPZ with several canonical processes but often using alternate mathematical forms. It uses temperature-scaling of rates (Eppley-like), an explicit light-limitation computed from Beer\u2013Lambert averaging over a mixed layer, Liebig minimum co-limitation (min(light, nutrient)) for phytoplankton growth, a Holling II grazing functional response, assimilation efficiencies and mortality-based recycling. Compared with the TRUTH NPZ, the candidate (a) does not implement the same nutrient uptake formula (TRUTH: N/(e+N) \u00d7 a/(b + cP) \u00d7 P) but uses Monod-type nutrient and light limitation combined via a min() and a variable assimilation efficiency; (b) replaces TRUTH's recycling-from-grazing terms with recycling tied to mortality losses only; and (c) omits the explicit mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations that TRUTH has. The candidate therefore matches ecological roles (growth, grazing, mortality, recycling) but often as alternates from the literature (Liebig, Monod, Holling II, linear + quadratic mortality) and adds new processes (temperature dependence, explicit light attenuation/averaging, variable assimilation efficiency, quadratic Z mortality).",
