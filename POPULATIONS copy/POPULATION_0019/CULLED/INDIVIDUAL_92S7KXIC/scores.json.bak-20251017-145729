  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements an NPZ structure with the canonical nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 zooplankton grazing \u2192 zooplankton mortality loop, but many mechanistic details differ from the TRUTH Python NPZ. Nutrient uptake in the candidate uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term combined with Liebig's minimum (light vs nutrient) and a variable, bounded uptake efficiency; grazing is implemented as a Holling type II functional response (vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Recycling is present but formulated as a fraction of mortality losses (gamma * (P_loss + Z_loss)) rather than the TRUTH's explicit terms proportional to grazing and linear zooplankton loss. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt present in TRUTH. The candidate adds explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert depth-averaged I_avg and self-shading), temperature-dependent scaling of rates (Eppley-style exponential modifiers), a nutrient-dependent variable phytoplankton uptake efficiency (bounded logistic), and quadratic zooplankton mortality \u2014 all not in the TRUTH model. Overall, the candidate matches many ecological roles but uses alternate functional forms for uptake, grazing, and recycling and includes extra processes (light physics, temperature dependence, variable uptake efficiency, quadratic Z mortality).",
