  "qualitative_description": "Overall the C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with the three state equations (N, P, Z) and includes nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality and recycling. However the exact functional forms differ from the TRUTH model in many places: the candidate uses multiplicative Monod-type nutrient and explicit light limitation (I_avg) rather than the TRUTH algebraic light/self-shading term, uses a Holling type-II grazing instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (sigmoidal) grazing, and omits the TRUTH mixing (k*(N0-N)) and explicit recycling of unassimilated grazing back to N. The candidate also adds explicit temperature dependence (Q10) and an explicit irradiance/mixed-layer light calculation not present in TRUTH. These are realistic alternate formulations but not exact matches to the TRUTH model.",
