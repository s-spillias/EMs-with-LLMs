MODEL ASSESSMENT:

Current State:
- The model simulates NPZ dynamics with nutrient and light co-limitation
- Light limitation includes self-shading through phytoplankton biomass
- Parameter I_0 has been updated to 886 W m^-2 from literature, which is very high for oceanic PAR
- All efficiency parameters (epsilon_P, epsilon_Z, gamma_P, gamma_Z) are currently at placeholder values (0.0)
- The model uses multiplicative co-limitation for nutrients and light

Key Strengths:
- Mechanistic representation of light attenuation in mixed layer
- Differential recycling rates for phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality
- Proper use of Monod kinetics for resource limitation

Identified Gap:
- Missing temperature dependence of biological rates
- Temperature is a fundamental driver of metabolic processes in marine ecosystems
- All biological rates (phytoplankton growth, zooplankton grazing, mortality) are strongly temperature-dependent
- Seasonal temperature variation in the mixed layer can be 10-20°C, which would double or triple metabolic rates

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:

Add temperature-dependent rate modulation using Q10 formulation.

Ecological Justification:
1. Temperature affects enzyme kinetics and metabolic rates across all organisms
2. Q10 values for marine plankton typically range from 1.5-3.0 (rates increase 1.5-3x per 10°C)
3. Mixed layer temperature varies seasonally, affecting bloom timing and magnitude
4. Temperature-growth relationships are well-documented in laboratory and field studies
5. This mechanism can explain temporal dynamics beyond nutrient and light limitation

Mathematical Implementation:
- Add reference temperature (T_ref) as a parameter (currently set to constant value)
- Add Q10 parameter for temperature sensitivity
- Modify rates: rate_actual = rate_max * Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)
- Apply to r_P (phytoplankton growth), g_max (grazing), m_P and m_Z (mortality)
- Currently using T_ref as constant temperature (no temporal variation)
- Framework is ready to accept time-varying temperature data when available

Expected Improvements:
- Framework established for temperature effects on biological rates
- When temperature data is added, will better capture seasonal bloom dynamics
- More realistic representation of metabolic constraints
- Improved model fit during temperature transition periods
- Mechanistic explanation for rate variations beyond resource limitation

Parameters Added:
- T_ref (Reference temperature, set to 15°C for temperate oceans)
- Q10 (Temperature sensitivity coefficient, set to 2.0 for marine plankton)

Note: Temperature is currently constant (T = T_ref), so temp_factor = 1.0 and rates are not modified yet. When time-varying temperature data becomes available, it can be added as DATA_VECTOR(Temperature) and the model will automatically use it to modulate biological rates. This represents a fundamental ecological process framework that is now in place and ready for temperature data.
