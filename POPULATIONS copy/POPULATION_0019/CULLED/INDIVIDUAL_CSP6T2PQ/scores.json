  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the same high-level processes as the TRUTH model (uptake \u2192 P growth, grazing \u2192 Z growth, mortality, recycling) but uses different mathematical formulations in several places and omits the explicit environmental mixing term present in TRUTH. Key matches: Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) nutrient limitation, multiplicative nutrient \u00d7 light limitation for P growth, Holling type-II grazing, and linear mortalities. Key differences / omissions: no entrainment/mixing term for N (TRUTH's k*(N0-N) is absent) and no explicit return of unassimilated grazing to nutrients (recycling is implemented only as a fraction of mortality). The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) scaling of rates and an explicit depth-averaged light attenuation (I_avg with MLD and k_p, k_w) that are not in the TRUTH formulation.",

TRUTH uses N/(e+N) * ... * P (e.g. \"(N / (e + N)) * ... * P\").
