  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the standard ecological roles (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing, linear mortalities, and recycling from mortality) but uses different mathematical choices than the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth is implemented as a Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten (N/(K_N+N)) times P with an explicit assimilation efficiency (epsilon_P), grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_Z+P)) rather than the TRUTH's Type III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)), mortalities are simple linear terms (matching TRUTH's linear mortality structure), and recycling is a fractional return of phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality to nutrients. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and k*P), and it does not include a direct unassimilated-grazing-to-nutrients term analogous to TRUTH's beta*lambda_*P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z. The candidate also introduces an explicit assimilation efficiency on nutrient uptake (epsilon_P) that is not present in the TRUTH formulation.",
