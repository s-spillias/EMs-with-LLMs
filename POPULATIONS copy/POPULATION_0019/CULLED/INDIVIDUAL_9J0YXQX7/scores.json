  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, recycling, zooplankton growth) but via different mathematical choices than the TRUTH model. Key differences: phytoplankton growth uses Liebig min(light, nutrient) with an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light averaging and a nutrient-dependent uptake efficiency; grazing is Holling Type II rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form; recycling is implemented as a single bounded fraction of total mortality rather than the multiple TRUTH recycling/excretion terms; and the candidate omits the explicit mixing/dilution term present in TRUTH. The candidate also adds explicit light attenuation/self-shading and a nutrient-dependent (variable) phytoplankton uptake efficiency and quadratic zooplankton mortality \u2014 processes not present in TRUTH.",
