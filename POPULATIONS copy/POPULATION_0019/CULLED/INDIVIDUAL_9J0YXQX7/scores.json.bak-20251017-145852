  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N, P, Z) with uptake, growth, grazing, mortality and recycling, but many functional forms differ from the TRUTH code. Nutrient uptake/growth are implemented using a Liebig minimum (min(light, nutrient)) with Monod nutrient limitation and an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert averaged light (I_avg) rather than the TRUTH multiplicative term N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P). Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_Z+P)) rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (a Type\u2011III/sigmoidal) formulation. Recycling and mortality are present but parameterized differently (candidate recycles a fraction of P_loss + Z_loss and includes both linear and quadratic zooplankton mortality). The candidate also omits an explicit environmental mixing/dilution term for nutrients and phytoplankton that exists in TRUTH. Several physiologically explicit pieces (variable phytoplankton uptake efficiency that declines with N and an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light averaging using I_0, k_bg, k_c, H) are introduced and are not in the TRUTH model.",
