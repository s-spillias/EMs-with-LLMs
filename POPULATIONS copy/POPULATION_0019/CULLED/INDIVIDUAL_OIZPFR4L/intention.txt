MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current NPZ model implements standard plankton dynamics with Monod nutrient uptake and Holling Type II grazing.
The model structure is sound but missing a critical process for oceanic mixed layer dynamics: vertical export of organic matter.

IDENTIFIED GAP:
Currently, all non-assimilated grazed material (70% with e=0.3) is immediately recycled as nutrients.
In reality, phytoplankton cells and fecal pellets sink out of the mixed layer, representing a major loss pathway
that regulates bloom dynamics and nutrient availability. This is especially important in the oceanic mixed layer
where vertical export via sinking is a dominant process affecting nutrient budgets.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add phytoplankton sinking loss and split non-assimilated grazing into fast recycling vs. sinking export.

New parameters:
- s_P: Phytoplankton sinking rate (day^-1) - represents passive settling of cells out of mixed layer
- f_sink: Fraction of non-assimilated grazing that sinks rather than being immediately recycled (dimensionless, 0-1)
  This represents fecal pellet production and aggregation that leads to export

Modified equations:
- Phytoplankton loss now includes: mortality + grazing + sinking
- Nutrient recycling now includes: phytoplankton mortality + zooplankton mortality + 
  (1-e)*(1-f_sink)*grazing [fast recycling component only]
- Sinking export = s_P*P + (1-e)*f_sink*grazing [phytoplankton sinking + fecal pellet sinking]

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Phytoplankton sinking (s_P): Larger phytoplankton cells (diatoms) sink faster than small cells (picoplankton).
   Typical range: 0.01-0.5 day^-1 depending on cell size and aggregation state.
   
2. Fecal pellet sinking (f_sink): Zooplankton fecal pellets sink rapidly (10-100 m/day) and represent
   a major export pathway. Fraction that sinks vs. breaks up and remineralizes: typically 0.3-0.7.
   
3. This modification maintains mass balance while representing the "biological pump" - the vertical
   transport of organic carbon from surface to depth, which is fundamental to ocean biogeochemistry.

EXPECTED IMPACT:
- More realistic nutrient dynamics with export losses
- Better representation of bloom termination mechanisms
- Improved fit if data shows nutrient drawdown that exceeds what can be explained by biomass accumulation alone
