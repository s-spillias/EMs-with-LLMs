  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-mediated zooplankton growth with assimilation efficiency, and linear mortality for both phytoplankton and zooplankton. Many roles in the TRUTH model are present but not identical in functional form: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten form (candidate) while the TRUTH uses a multiplicative nutrient term times an additional P-dependent factor (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)-style saturation). Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) whereas TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form (Type III-like). The candidate explicitly partitions non-assimilated grazing into a fast-recycling fraction and a sinking_export fraction (via f_sink), which is more mechanistic than the TRUTH recycling terms. A notable omission relative to TRUTH is an environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0 - N))\u2014the candidate has no analogous dilution/entrainment forcing on N. Overall: functionally similar ecology, several alternate standard functional forms used, and one extra explicit partitioning of non-assimilated material into fast recycling vs sinking export.",
