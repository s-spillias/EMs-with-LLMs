MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements an NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) system with light limitation and self-shading effects. Key features include:
- Light limitation using Beer-Lambert law with background attenuation and phytoplankton self-shading
- Nutrient limitation via Monod kinetics
- Zooplankton grazing with Holling Type II functional response
- Linear and quadratic zooplankton mortality (representing natural death and predation)
- Nutrient recycling from dead organic matter

IDENTIFIED ISSUE:
The current model uses MULTIPLICATIVE co-limitation for light and nutrients:
  uptake = r_P * light_limitation * nutrient_limitation * P_prev

This formulation is ecologically problematic because:
1. It assumes both resources simultaneously limit growth proportionally
2. Creates unrealistically low growth when both resources are moderately available
3. Example: 70% light Ã— 70% nutrients = 49% growth (should be 70%)
4. Violates Liebig's Law of the Minimum, a fundamental principle in ecology

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANGE:
Liebig's Law of the Minimum states that growth is controlled by the scarcest resource, not the product of all resources. Extensive phytoplankton research supports this:
- Phytoplankton cells can store nutrients and adjust photosynthetic machinery
- When light-limited, cells increase chlorophyll; when nutrient-limited, they reduce it
- Growth rate is determined by whichever resource is MOST limiting at any moment
- This is the standard approach in modern marine biogeochemical models (e.g., DARWIN, PISCES)

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Replace multiplicative co-limitation with Liebig's Law of the Minimum:
  limitation_factor = min(light_limitation, nutrient_limitation)
  uptake = r_P * limitation_factor * P_prev

This change:
1. Is more ecologically realistic and theoretically sound
2. Better represents phytoplankton physiological adaptation
3. Will likely improve model fit by allowing higher growth rates when one resource is abundant
4. Maintains mathematical simplicity while improving biological realism
5. Aligns with established marine ecosystem modeling practices

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Modify model.cpp to use minimum of light and nutrient limitation
- No new parameters required
- Update comments to reflect Liebig's Law
- All existing parameters remain valid with their current bounds

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- More realistic phytoplankton growth dynamics
- Better representation of bloom formation when either light or nutrients become available
- Improved model fit to observed data
- More accurate representation of resource competition dynamics
