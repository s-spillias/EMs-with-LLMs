  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a classical NPZ structure but with several substantive formulation differences versus the TRUTH model. Phytoplankton growth in the candidate is driven by an explicit light sub-model (Beer-Lambert depth-averaged I_avg) and a Liebig minimum (min(light, nutrient)) combined with a Monod nutrient term, whereas TRUTH uses a multiplicative uptake term (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+cP))*P. Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II with explicit assimilation efficiency, while TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form for grazing/consumption. Recycling in the candidate is implemented as remineralization of mortality (gamma * (P_loss + Z_loss)), rather than the TRUTH formulation that includes specific recycling terms tied to grazing and zooplankton processes. The candidate adds density-dependent quadratic zooplankton mortality and an explicit light attenuation/self-shading submodel that are not present in TRUTH. The candidate also omits an explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term analogous to TRUTH's k*(N0 - N). Numerical integration and observation/error handling differ (Euler forward integration and likelihood penalties in the candidate vs. solve_ivp RK45 and no observation model in TRUTH script).",
