Key Observation:                                                                                                                                                                                                            

The model uses multiplicative co-limitation for light and nutrients, which is ecologically problematic. In reality, phytoplankton growth is typically limited by the most limiting resource (Liebig's Law of the Minimum),  
not the product of both limitations. The current formulation (light_limitation × nutrient_limitation) creates unrealistically low growth rates when both resources are moderately available.                                

For example:                                                                                                                                                                                                                

 • If light_limitation = 0.7 and nutrient_limitation = 0.7                                                                                                                                                                  
 • Current model: growth factor = 0.7 × 0.7 = 0.49 (49% of maximum)                                                                                                                                                         
 • Liebig's Law: growth factor = min(0.7, 0.7) = 0.7 (70% of maximum)                                                                                                                                                       

Proposed Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Replace multiplicative co-limitation with Liebig's Law of the Minimum - phytoplankton growth is limited by whichever resource (light or nutrients) is most scarce. This is more ecologically realistic and widely supported 
in phytoplankton ecology literature.                                                                                                                                                                                        

Additionally, I notice the model could benefit from temperature-dependent growth rates, which is a fundamental control on metabolic processes in marine ecosystems. However, since we don't have temperature data, I'll     
focus on the co-limitation improvement.
