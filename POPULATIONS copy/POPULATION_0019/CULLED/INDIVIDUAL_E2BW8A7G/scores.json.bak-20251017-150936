  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements a standard Monod-type nutrient uptake with Holling Type II grazing, linear (first-order) mortality for both P and Z, and a simple fractional recycling of dead biomass back to nutrients. It omits the TRUTH model's explicit mixing/entrainment term and the more complex light/biomass-dependent term in the phytoplankton uptake (the TRUTH model uses (a/(b+cP)) factor and a P^2-form grazing/recycling). The candidate therefore matches canonical ecological roles (uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) but uses simpler/alternate functional forms for uptake and grazing and lacks physical mixing and light limitation. The implementation also contains statistical elements (observation error parameters and soft priors) and numerical choices (Euler integration) that are not ecological processes.",
