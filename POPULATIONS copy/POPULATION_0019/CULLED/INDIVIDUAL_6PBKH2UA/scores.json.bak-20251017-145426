  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the same high-level ecological roles as the TRUTH model (nutrient-limited, light-modulated phytoplankton growth; grazing-driven zooplankton growth; recycling to nutrients), but uses different functional forms and omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton. Uptake/growth in the candidate is implemented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit depth-integrated light factor (explicit I0, k_w, k_c, H), whereas the TRUTH uses a different multiplicative form (N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P)). Grazing/growth transfers are present but use Holling Type II in the candidate versus a P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) (sigmoidal/Holling-III-like) form in TRUTH. Zooplankton mortality in the candidate includes an extra density-dependent quadratic term absent in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches ecological roles but many components are ALTERNATE formulations rather than exact TRUTH matches; mixing/entrainment terms from TRUTH are missing in the candidate.",
