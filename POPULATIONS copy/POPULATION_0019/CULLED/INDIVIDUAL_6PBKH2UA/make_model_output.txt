The current model uses linear mortality for zooplankton, but in reality, zooplankton experience density-dependent mortality due to:                                                                                         

 • Predation by higher trophic levels (increases with Z density)                                                                                                                                                            
 • Cannibalism at high densities                                                                                                                                                                                            
 • Disease transmission (increases with crowding)                                                                                                                                                                           

The very low and tightly constrained m_Z value (0.046 day⁻¹) from literature suggests this represents only basal mortality, not the full mortality signal. Adding quadratic (density-dependent) mortality would better      
capture the ecological reality that zooplankton populations are controlled by both constant background mortality and density-dependent predation/crowding effects.                                                          

Proposed Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Replace linear zooplankton mortality with a density-dependent (quadratic) mortality term that includes both:                                                                                                                

 • Linear component (basal mortality, disease, senescence)                                                                                                                                                                  
 • Quadratic component (predation by higher trophic levels, cannibalism)                                                                                                                                                    

This is ecologically justified because:

 3 This creates a stabilizing feedback that prevents unrealistic zooplankton blooms
