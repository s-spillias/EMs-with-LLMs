MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current NPZ model implements nutrient and light co-limitation for phytoplankton growth, Holling Type II grazing, and linear mortality terms. The model structure is ecologically sound but has a key limitation in the zooplankton mortality formulation.

PARAMETER ANALYSIS:
- m_Z has been updated to 0.046 day^-1 with very tight bounds (0.046 to 0.046000000046)
- This extremely low and constrained value suggests it represents only basal/background mortality
- I_0 updated to 443 Î¼mol photons m^-2 s^-1 with wide range (163-886), indicating variable light environments

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The linear zooplankton mortality (m_Z * Z) is ecologically oversimplified. In marine ecosystems, zooplankton experience:
1. Basal mortality (disease, senescence) - constant rate, independent of density
2. Predation mortality (fish, jellyfish, other predators) - increases with zooplankton density
3. Cannibalism and crowding effects - increase with density squared

The very low m_Z value from literature (0.046 day^-1) likely represents only basal mortality, not the full mortality signal that would include density-dependent predation.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Replace linear zooplankton mortality with density-dependent (quadratic) mortality:
- OLD: zoo_mortality = m_Z * Z
- NEW: zoo_mortality = m_Z * Z + m_Z2 * Z^2

Where:
- m_Z = basal mortality rate (linear term) - already constrained by literature at 0.046 day^-1
- m_Z2 = density-dependent mortality rate (quadratic term) - represents predation by higher trophic levels

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Predator-prey encounter rates scale with prey density squared in well-mixed systems
2. Higher trophic level predators (fish) respond functionally to zooplankton abundance
3. Quadratic mortality creates stabilizing feedback preventing unrealistic zooplankton blooms
4. Standard formulation in NPZD (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus) models
5. Separates density-independent (basal) from density-dependent (predation) mortality processes

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Add new parameter m_Z2 (units: m^3 (g C)^-1 day^-1)
- Modify EQUATION 7 to include quadratic term
- Update nutrient recycling (EQUATION 8) to include new mortality flux
- Maintain all other equations unchanged

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR:
- At low Z densities: mortality dominated by basal rate (m_Z)
- At high Z densities: mortality dominated by predation (m_Z2 * Z^2)
- Creates realistic population regulation and prevents runaway zooplankton growth
- Better captures the full mortality signal in marine ecosystems
