  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the basic NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, linear mortalities, and recycling) but with different functional choices. Key differences: phytoplankton uptake is implemented as multiplicative Monod (nutrient limitation * explicit light limitation) rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) form; grazing is Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_Z+P)) instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (sigmoidal) form; recycling in the candidate is a simple fraction of dead biomass (mortality-based recycling) rather than the TRUTH's combination of predation-derived recycling and explicit terms like beta*lambda_*P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z and gamma*q*Z. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton that exists in TRUTH. The candidate adds an explicit light limitation term (I/(K_I+I)) as an ecological forcing (not present in TRUTH).",
