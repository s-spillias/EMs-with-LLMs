  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard 3-box NPZ with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, a Holling type-II grazing, linear mortalities, and recycling from mortalities plus assimilation into zooplankton. It differs from the TRUTH NPZ in three main ways: (1) the uptake term is a simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten form (no a/(b + c*P) predator-dependent/light term present in TRUTH), (2) recycling is implemented only as a fraction of mortality (gamma * (P_loss + Z_loss)) rather than the TRUTH's explicit grazing-mediated recycling terms, and (3) there is no physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients or phytoplankton. The candidate therefore matches several canonical ecological roles but uses alternate (simpler) functional forms for uptake and grazing and omits mixing.",
