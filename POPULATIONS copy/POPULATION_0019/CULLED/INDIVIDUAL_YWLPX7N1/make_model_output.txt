Current Model Structure:                                                                                                                                                                                                    

The model implements a classic NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) model with:

 • Holling Type II functional response for zooplankton grazing

 • Nutrient recycling from dead organic matter                                                                                                                                                                              

Key Observations:                                                                                                                                                                                                           

 1 Parameter Values Analysis: The efficiency parameters (epsilon_P, epsilon_Z, gamma) are initialized at 0.0 with logit transformation, which transforms to 0.5 after the logistic function. This is a reasonable middle    
   ground but may not reflect ecological reality where these efficiencies are typically asymmetric.                                                                                                                         
 2 Missing Ecological Process: The model lacks density-dependent mortality for zooplankton, which is a critical mechanism in plankton dynamics. In real systems, zooplankton experience increased mortality at higher       
   densities due to:                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    • Increased predation pressure from higher trophic levels                                                                                                                                                               
    • Disease transmission                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    • Cannibalism in some species                                                                                                                                                                                           
    • Resource depletion leading to stress                                                                                                                                                                                  
 3 Oversimplification: Linear mortality assumes constant per-capita death rates regardless of population density, which is unrealistic for zooplankton that often exhibit boom-bust dynamics.                               

Proposed Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                       

I will add quadratic (density-dependent) mortality for zooplankton. This is a well-established ecological mechanism that:                                                                                                   

 • Captures predation by higher trophic levels (implicitly)                                                                                                                                                                 
 • Prevents unrealistic zooplankton blooms                                                                                                                                                                                  
 • Creates more realistic oscillatory dynamics                                                                                                                                                                              
 • Is mathematically simple (adding one parameter)
