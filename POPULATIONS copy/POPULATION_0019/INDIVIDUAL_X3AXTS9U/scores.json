  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but differs in specific mechanistic choices from the TRUTH Python model. Both models have nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth with assimilation efficiency, and linear mortality of P and Z. Key differences: the candidate implements explicit light physics (depth-averaged irradiance with self-shading) and a flexible harmonic-mean co-limitation (theta) between light and nutrients, uses a Holling Type II grazing (candidate) versus a Type-III-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing in TRUTH, represents recycling as remineralization from mortality only (not explicit recycling from grazing/excretion), and omits an explicit mixing/entrainment nutrient term present in TRUTH.",
