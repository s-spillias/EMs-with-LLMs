  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ closure that captures the major ecological roles (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, and zooplankton assimilation) but differs in mathematical detail and in several additional processes. Phytoplankton growth is modeled as resource- and light-limited Monod-type uptake combined via a flexible co-limitation (harmonic mean / theta), and grazing uses a Holling-II (saturating) functional response rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (type-III) form. Mortality terms are linear in both models and therefore map closely. Important omissions relative to TRUTH: the candidate lacks an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations and does not return unassimilated grazing directly to nutrients (no explicit grazing-derived recycling term). The candidate includes extra processes not present in TRUTH (temperature/Arrhenius modifiers, Steele photoinhibition light function with self-shading, flexible co-limitation parameter theta, and an explicit phytoplankton \u201cuptake efficiency\u201d), which change model behavior and identifiability.",
