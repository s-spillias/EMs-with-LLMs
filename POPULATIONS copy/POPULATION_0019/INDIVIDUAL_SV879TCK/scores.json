  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, linear mortality on P and Z) but uses different functional forms for several processes and omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment. Uptake/growth are implemented as a Monod nutrient term combined with an explicit Steele photoinhibition light function and a flexible harmonic-mean co-limitation (theta), rather than the TRUTH multiplicative form a/(b+cP) \u00d7 N/(e+N). Grazing is a Holling-II/P/(K+P) form (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). Recycling in the candidate comes only from mortality (gamma_P * P_loss + gamma_Z * Z_loss) and does not include predation-linked recycling terms present in TRUTH. Notable extras (not in TRUTH) are explicit temperature dependence via Arrhenius modifiers, explicit mixed-layer light averaging with Steele photoinhibition (I_0, I_opt, k_w, k_p, MLD), and a flexible co-limitation parameter (theta). Crucially, the candidate does not include the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term in dN (k*(N0-N)) nor explicit mixing losses for P or Z.",
