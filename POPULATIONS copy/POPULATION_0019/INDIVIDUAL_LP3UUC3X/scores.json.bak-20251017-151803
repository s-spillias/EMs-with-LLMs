  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the main NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) but using different functional forms and with some important omissions/additions relative to the TRUTH Python NPZ. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Michaelis-Menten type N-limitation multiplied by an explicit light-limitation (co-limitation), rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) form. Grazing and zooplankton growth are present as Holling-Type II (g_max * P/(K_Z+P) * Z) with assimilation, instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) form. The candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (TRUTH has k*(N0 - N) and (s+k)*P), and instead returns nutrients only via a simple fraction of mortalities. The candidate adds explicit light attenuation / mixed-layer averaging and an Arrhenius temperature modifier (currently neutral if T = T_ref), and includes quadratic zooplankton mortality; these are extra ecological processes not present in the TRUTH script.",
