Model Assessment:
The existing model provides a reasonable predator-prey framework but has limitations in capturing the explosive, episodic nature of COTS outbreaks. A critical review identified two key areas for improvement:

1.  Parameter Inconsistency: The parameter for COTS natural mortality, `log_m_C`, was updated from literature with a direct value (1.109), but the model code continued to apply an exponential transformation (`exp(log_m_C)`). This results in an unrealistically high mortality rate that would suppress any population growth. This has been corrected by treating the parameter as a direct value (`m_C`) throughout the model.

2.  Missing Ecological Mechanism: The model lacks a mechanism to explain the rapid transition from low-density populations to outbreak levels (the "boom" phase). COTS are broadcast spawners and are known to experience Allee effects, where per-capita reproductive success is low at low population densities due to fertilization limitation.

Chosen Improvement: Introduction of an Allee Effect on COTS Reproduction.

Reasoning:
To better capture the characteristic "boom-bust" dynamics of COTS, I have introduced an Allee effect into the COTS growth equation. This modification introduces a density-dependent reproductive efficiency, where the population's growth rate is significantly suppressed at low densities.

This change is ecologically crucial for the following reasons:
- It creates a population density threshold that must be overcome for an outbreak to be triggered, reflecting the reality of mate-finding and fertilization success in broadcast spawners.
- It allows the model to endogenously generate the explosive "boom" phase of an outbreak once the COTS population crosses this critical density, rather than relying solely on external drivers.
- It improves the model's ability to address the project's core objective: to accurately model the timing, magnitude, and triggers of COTS population explosions.

This is implemented by adding a new parameter, `log_A_allee` (the Allee threshold), and modifying the COTS growth equation to include a term `C / (C + A_allee)`, which scales reproductive output based on population density.
