Based on my assessment of the model and its parameters, I have identified a critical correction and a significant ecological improvement to better capture the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks as described in the     
project context.                                                                                                                                                                                                            

                                                                                            Assessment and Rationale for Changes                                                                                            

 1 Model Assessment: The current model provides a solid foundation for predator-prey dynamics between COTS and corals, incorporating selective predation (Holling Type II), logistic coral growth, and mortality from both  
   predation and thermal bleaching. However, its ability to model the triggering of COTS outbreaks is limited. The dynamics are primarily driven by an external immigration variable (cotsimm_dat) and a simple             
   density-dependent mortality term, which may not fully capture the explosive "boom" phase of an outbreak that arises from low-density populations.                                                                        
 2 Parameter Correction: A review of parameters.json revealed a critical inconsistency. The parameter log_m_C (COTS natural mortality) was updated from literature with a direct value (1.109), but the model code          
   (model.cpp) still treats it as a log-transformed parameter by applying exp(). This results in a massively overestimated mortality rate (exp(1.109) ≈ 3.03 year⁻¹), which would prevent any realistic population growth.  
   My first change corrects this by renaming the parameter to m_C and removing the exp() transformation in the model, ensuring the literature value is used as intended.                                                    
 3 Ecological Improvement: To better model the "boom-bust" cycle and the mechanisms that trigger outbreaks, I am introducing an Allee effect on COTS reproduction. At low population densities, COTS suffer from reduced    
   reproductive success due to mate-finding limitation (broadcast spawning). The current model lacks this mechanism, allowing populations to grow even from very low densities.                                             
   By adding an Allee effect, the model will now include a critical density threshold. Below this threshold, the COTS population's growth rate is suppressed, making it difficult for small, sparse populations to initiate 
   an outbreak. Once the population surpasses this threshold (e.g., through a larval immigration event), the per-capita reproductive rate increases rapidly, allowing for the explosive "boom" characteristic of COTS       
   outbreaks. This change directly addresses the project's goal of modeling the mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreaks by making population growth dependent on achieving a critical density.                        

This improvement is implemented by adding a new parameter, log_A_allee (the Allee threshold), and modifying the COTS growth equation to include a saturating term that represents reproductive efficiency.                  

These changes will make the model more ecologically realistic and better suited to exploring the complex, non-linear dynamics of COTS outbreaks.

 +1.  Parameter Inconsistency: The parameter for COTS natural mortality, `log_m_C`, was updated from literature with a direct value (1.109), but the model code continued to apply an exponential transformation            
 (`exp(log_m_C)`). This results in an unrealistically high mortality rate that would suppress any population growth. This has been corrected by treating the parameter as a direct value (`m_C`) throughout the model.

 +2.  Missing Ecological Mechanism: The model lacks a mechanism to explain the rapid transition from low-density populations to outbreak levels (the "boom" phase). COTS are broadcast spawners and are known to experience 
 Allee effects, where per-capita reproductive success is low at low population densities due to fertilization limitation.

 +To better capture the characteristic "boom-bust" dynamics of COTS, I have introduced an Allee effect into the COTS growth equation. This modification introduces a density-dependent reproductive efficiency, where the

 +- It allows the model to endogenously generate the explosive "boom" phase of an outbreak once the COTS population crosses this critical density, rather than relying solely on external drivers.

 +This is implemented by adding a new parameter, `log_A_allee` (the Allee threshold), and modifying the COTS growth equation to include a term `C / (C + A_allee)`, which scales reproductive output based on population
