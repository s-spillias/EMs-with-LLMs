Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) dynamics. It effectively captures key processes such as selective predation on different coral types, coral competition, and temperature-induced bleaching. The inclusion of an Allee effect for COTS reproduction and a predator satiation mechanism are sophisticated features that are critical for modeling the initiation and persistence of outbreaks.

However, a key simplification exists in the COTS mortality formulation. The current density-dependent mortality term (`m_C_dd * C^2`) is generic and does not explicitly link COTS survival to the availability of their coral food source. This is a major limitation, as the "bust" phase of a COTS boom-bust cycle is primarily driven by mass starvation after the reef's coral has been consumed.

Proposed Improvement:
To more accurately capture the full boom-bust cycle, I will introduce an explicit starvation-induced mortality mechanism for the COTS population. This new mortality term will be inversely related to the total available coral cover.

Ecological Justification:
This change introduces a crucial negative feedback loop that is fundamental to predator-prey dynamics. As the COTS population increases and decimates the coral, their food source becomes scarce. The resulting starvation leads to a rapid increase in COTS mortality, causing the population to crash. This allows the coral community to begin a recovery phase. By explicitly modeling this starvation feedback, the model will be better equipped to simulate the characteristic timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks and their subsequent decline, which is a primary goal of the project.

Implementation Details:
I will add a new starvation mortality term to the COTS dynamics equation:
`starvation_mortality = m_starve * C * (1 / (1 + (F + S) / K_starve))`

This requires two new parameters:
1. `log_m_starve`: The log of the maximum COTS mortality rate from starvation.
2. `log_K_starve`: The log of the coral cover threshold below which starvation effects become pronounced.
