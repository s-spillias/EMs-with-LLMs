MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating COTS-coral dynamics, incorporating logistic coral growth, Holling Type II predation by COTS, and SST-induced bleaching. The project's primary goal is to capture the characteristic "boom-bust" cycles of COTS outbreaks. The model currently relies on a high constant natural mortality rate (m_C = 1.74 year⁻¹) to induce the "bust" phase. This value, while updated from literature, is ecologically questionable as it implies a very short lifespan and likely compensates for a missing ecological mechanism. The key process driving the collapse of COTS outbreaks—starvation due to coral resource depletion—is not explicitly represented.

PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
To create a more realistic "bust" dynamic, I will introduce an explicit starvation-induced mortality term for COTS. This makes COTS mortality directly dependent on the availability of their food source (coral cover).

ECOLOGICAL RATIONALE:
This change establishes a critical negative feedback loop that is fundamental to predator-prey cycles. As the COTS population booms and consumes its coral food source, the dwindling resource base leads to increased starvation, causing the COTS population to crash. This is a more direct and mechanistically sound explanation for the "bust" phase than a constant, high background mortality.

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
The COTS mortality term will be updated to include a food-dependent starvation component. The total mortality rate will now be a sum of background natural mortality, starvation mortality, and density-dependent mortality.

The starvation rate (m_starve) will be modeled as an inverse function of total coral cover (F+S):
m_starve = m_starve_max / (1 + (F + S) / K_starve)

This introduces two new parameters:
1.  `log_m_starve_max`: The log of the maximum starvation rate that occurs as coral cover approaches zero.
2.  `log_K_starve`: The log of the coral cover (%) at which the starvation rate is half its maximum.

Simultaneously, the `m_C` parameter, representing background natural mortality, will be revised to a more ecologically plausible initial estimate, as its previous high value is now redundant. This structural change will allow the model to more accurately simulate the full boom-and-bust cycle of COTS outbreaks.
