### Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

#### 1. Assessment of the Current Model

The existing model provides a robust framework for simulating the interaction between Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and coral communities. It correctly includes:
- Differential dynamics for fast- and slow-growing corals.
- A Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation, capturing satiation.
- An Allee effect, which is important for population dynamics at low densities.
- Density-dependent mortality (`m_C_dd`), which helps regulate the COTS population at high densities.
- The influence of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) on coral bleaching.

However, a key ecological process is oversimplified. The model currently links resource (coral) depletion to a reduction in COTS *growth*, but it lacks a direct link between resource scarcity and COTS *mortality*. In reality, as COTS consume available coral during an outbreak, starvation becomes a primary driver of the subsequent population crash. The current density-dependent mortality term (`m_C_dd*C^2`) is a generic representation of crowding effects but does not explicitly capture this critical resource-feedback mechanism.

#### 2. Proposed Ecological Improvement: Starvation-Induced COTS Mortality

To better capture the "boom-bust" cycle described in the project context, I will introduce a **starvation-induced mortality term** for COTS. This change will make the COTS mortality rate dynamically dependent on the availability of their food source (coral cover).

**Ecological Rationale:**
This modification introduces a strong negative feedback loop. When the COTS population is high and coral cover is depleted, the starvation rate will increase, leading to a more rapid and realistic population decline (the "bust"). This directly links COTS survival to the health of the coral community, a fundamental aspect of their predator-prey relationship.

**Implementation Details:**
I will add a new mortality component to the COTS dynamics equation. This component will be a hyperbolic function of the total coral cover from the previous time step (`F_prev + S_prev`).

- **New Equation Component:** `Starvation_Mortality_Rate = m_C_starve_max / (1 + (F_prev + S_prev) / K_starve)`
- The total COTS mortality will be updated to: `dC/dt = ... - (m_C + Starvation_Mortality_Rate)*C - m_C_dd*C^2 + ...`

**New Parameters:**
1.  `log_m_C_starve_max`: The log of the maximum per-capita mortality rate due to starvation when coral cover approaches zero. This parameter controls the intensity of the starvation effect.
2.  `log_K_starve`: The log of the coral cover (%) at which the starvation mortality rate is half its maximum. This parameter defines the sensitivity of COTS to declining coral cover.

This improvement will enhance the model's ecological realism and its ability to predict the full, sharp cycle of COTS outbreaks and crashes.
