MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating COTS boom-bust dynamics. It correctly incorporates several key ecological mechanisms:
1.  **Predator Satiation (C_escape):** Allows COTS to escape predation at high densities, triggering outbreaks.
2.  **Allee Effect (C_allee):** Ensures reproduction is limited at very low densities.
3.  **Density-Dependent Mortality (m_C_dd):** Contributes to the "bust" phase at peak outbreak levels.
4.  **Selective Predation (a_F, a_S):** Differentiates COTS feeding preference for fast and slow corals.

The primary simplification is the use of a single conversion efficiency parameter (`e_C`). This assumes that COTS gain the same energy from consuming fast-growing (preferred) and slow-growing (less preferred) corals, which is ecologically unrealistic. The nutritional value of different coral types likely varies, which would directly impact COTS growth and reproductive output, thereby affecting the magnitude and duration of outbreaks.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
To enhance the model's ecological realism and better capture the drivers of outbreak dynamics, I will implement **differential conversion efficiency**.

1.  **Ecological Rationale:** Fast-growing corals (Acropora) are the preferred food for COTS and are likely more nutritionally valuable. By assigning a higher conversion efficiency for fast corals (`e_C_F`) and a lower one for slow corals (`e_C_S`), the model will more accurately link food quality to population growth. This will create a stronger feedback where an abundance of high-quality food leads to more explosive outbreaks, while a switch to lower-quality food naturally dampens population growth and contributes to the bust cycle.

2.  **Implementation Details:**
    - The single parameter `log_e_C` will be removed from `parameters.json`.
    - Two new parameters, `log_e_C_F` and `log_e_C_S`, will be added to `parameters.json` with distinct values reflecting their differential nutritional contribution.
    - The COTS growth equation in `model.cpp` will be modified from `e_C * (total_consumption_F + total_consumption_S)` to `(e_C_F * total_consumption_F + e_C_S * total_consumption_S)`.

This change directly addresses the project context's focus on the mechanisms that sustain outbreaks by introducing a more nuanced link between predation and COTS population dynamics.
