Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating COTS-coral dynamics. It includes critical processes such as selective predation on fast and slow-growing corals (Holling Type II response), logistic growth of coral communities, temperature-dependent bleaching, and key COTS population dynamics (reproductive Allee effect, density-dependent mortality).

However, the model's ability to capture the full magnitude and duration of COTS outbreaks may be limited. The current COTS mortality is modeled as `m_C*C + m_C_dd*C^2`, which results in a per-capita mortality rate that strictly increases with density. This structure might exert too much control on the COTS population at low-to-medium densities, preventing the explosive growth characteristic of "boom" cycles. The model lacks a mechanism for the COTS population to escape predation pressure, which is a hypothesized driver for sustaining outbreaks.

Proposed Ecological Improvement:
To address this, I will introduce a "survival Allee effect" into the COTS mortality dynamics. This change is based on the ecological principle of predator dilution and satiation. At low densities, individual COTS are highly vulnerable to predation. As their population increases, the risk per individual decreases because predators become satiated or confused, allowing the COTS population to "escape" this source of mortality and grow explosively.

I will modify the mortality equation to reflect this. The new formulation will create a U-shaped per-capita mortality curve:
1.  At low COTS densities, per-capita mortality will be high (predation is efficient).
2.  At intermediate densities, per-capita mortality will decrease as predator satiation takes effect, allowing for rapid population growth.
3.  At very high densities, per-capita mortality will increase again due to factors like disease and starvation (the existing `m_C_dd` term).

This change replaces the simple linear natural mortality term (`m_C*C`) with a saturating function representing predation, `(m_C_max * C) / (1 + C / A_mort_s)`. This provides a powerful and ecologically justified mechanism to better simulate the "boom-bust" cycles central to the project's context.
