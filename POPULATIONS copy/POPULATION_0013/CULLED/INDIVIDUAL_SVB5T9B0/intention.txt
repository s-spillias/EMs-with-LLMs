Model Assessment:
The current model establishes a solid foundation for simulating COTS-coral interactions. It correctly incorporates several key ecological processes: Holling Type II predation, logistic coral growth, temperature-induced bleaching mortality, and Allee effects for both COTS reproduction (mate-finding limitation) and survival (predator satiation). These features are essential for modeling the non-linear, boom-bust dynamics characteristic of COTS populations.

However, the model's ability to endogenously generate and sustain outbreaks is limited. It relies on an external data stream for COTS immigration (`cotsimm_dat`) to initiate population increases, but lacks a feedback mechanism to amplify these initial pulses into a full-scale outbreak.

Proposed Ecological Improvement:
I will introduce a positive feedback mechanism where COTS recruitment success is enhanced by the availability of open substrate, which is inversely related to live coral cover. This is based on the ecological hypothesis that COTS larvae preferentially settle on crustose coralline algae (CCA), which thrives in areas of dead coral. This feedback loop can amplify an initial COTS population increase into an explosive outbreak, better capturing the "boom" phase described in the project context.

Implementation Details:
1. A new parameter, `log_settle_pref`, will be introduced to quantify the strength of this settlement preference for open space.
2. A `settlement_factor` will be calculated at each time step based on the proportion of unoccupied space relative to the total coral carrying capacity.
3. This factor will then be used to scale the total potential COTS recruitment, which includes both locally produced offspring (`cots_growth`) and larvae from external sources (`cotsimm_dat`).
4. The COTS dynamics equation will be updated to reflect that `dC/dt = (Recruitment) * SettlementFactor - Mortality`.
