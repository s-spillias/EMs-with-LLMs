Model Assessment:
1.  Data Fit: The model structure is a plausible representation of a COTS-coral system. Without residual analysis, a quantitative assessment of fit is not possible. However, the process equations are based on established ecological theory (logistic growth, Holling Type II predation).
2.  Project Context Alignment: The model effectively incorporates key elements of the project context, including selective predation on two coral types, boom-bust dynamics via density-dependence and resource limitation, and an outbreak trigger through larval immigration. The primary area for improvement is strengthening the "bust" phase of the COTS population cycle. The current density-dependent mortality (`m_C_dd*C^2`) is independent of food availability, which is a simplification.
3.  Missing Ecological Processes: The most significant oversimplification is the lack of an explicit starvation mechanism for COTS when coral cover is depleted. COTS outbreaks are characterized by rapid population growth followed by a sharp decline once the food source is exhausted. A direct link between coral scarcity and COTS mortality would better capture this critical feedback.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
-   **Approach:** Introduce a resource-limitation mechanism directly into the COTS mortality function.
-   **Ecological Rationale:** I will modify the density-dependent mortality term to reflect increased mortality due to starvation when coral cover is low. The ecological reasoning is that the negative effects of crowding (competition, stress, disease transmission), captured by the density-dependent mortality term, are significantly amplified when food is scarce. This creates a strong, realistic feedback loop where the COTS population crashes after consuming its primary food source, which is essential for modeling the "bust" part of the outbreak cycle.
-   **Mathematical Implementation:** The COTS mortality term `m_C_dd * C^2` will be changed to `m_C_dd * (K_coral / (F + S)) * C^2`. In this formulation, the mortality coefficient is scaled by the inverse of the relative coral cover. As coral cover `(F+S)` approaches zero, this mortality factor becomes very large, triggering a population crash. This change is parsimonious as it leverages the existing `m_C_dd` parameter, re-interpreting it as a coefficient for mortality driven by both density and resource scarcity, thus avoiding the need to add and estimate new parameters. The description for `log_m_C_dd` in `parameters.json` will be updated to reflect this new role.
