Model Assessment:
The current model provides a robust framework for simulating COTS population dynamics, incorporating essential mechanisms like an Allee effect for reproduction, predator satiation allowing for population escape, and density-dependent regulation for the 'bust' phase of an outbreak. It correctly models selective predation on two coral groups (fast and slow growing) and includes temperature-driven coral mortality (bleaching).

However, the model simplifies the interaction between environmental stressors and predation. Currently, coral bleaching and COTS predation are treated as independent sources of coral mortality. This overlooks potential synergistic effects where corals weakened by thermal stress may become more vulnerable to predation. This interaction could be a critical factor in both triggering and sustaining COTS outbreaks, a key focus of the project.

Proposed Ecological Improvement:
To better capture the system's dynamics, I will introduce an environmental modifier to the COTS predation functional response. Specifically, the COTS attack rates on fast-growing (a_F) and slow-growing (a_S) corals will be increased in response to thermal stress.

Reasoning and Justification:
This improvement is based on the ecological hypothesis that sublethal stress from high sea surface temperatures (SST) can compromise coral defenses, making them more susceptible to predation. By making the attack rate a function of the SST anomaly above the respective bleaching threshold for each coral type, the model can simulate this synergistic effect.

The mathematical implementation will be:
a_effective = a_base * (1 + s_a_sst * max(0, SST - T_bleach))

Where 's_a_sst' is a new sensitivity parameter. This creates a positive feedback loop:
1. High SST stresses corals.
2. Stressed corals become easier to prey upon (higher effective attack rate).
3. Increased food availability fuels COTS population growth.
4. A larger COTS population exerts greater predation pressure, further accelerating coral decline.

This mechanism provides a more nuanced and realistic pathway for outbreak intensification, directly linking a key environmental driver (SST) to the predator-prey interaction that governs the boom-bust cycle. This change directly addresses the project's goal of better modeling the triggers and sustaining forces of COTS outbreaks.
