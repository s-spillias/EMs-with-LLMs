**Model Assessment:**
The current model provides a solid foundation for exploring COTS outbreaks. It correctly incorporates key ecological processes, including Holling Type II predation by COTS, logistic growth and competition between coral types, and temperature-driven bleaching mortality. The COTS population dynamics are well-represented with an Allee effect for reproduction and a predator satiation mechanism, which are essential for capturing the characteristic boom-bust cycles.

**Identified Weakness:**
The primary weakness in the context of modeling outbreak *triggers* is the representation of COTS recruitment. The model currently uses `cotsimm_dat`, a pre-defined data stream for larval immigration. This is a non-mechanistic approach that treats recruitment as an external forcing variable, rather than an emergent property of the ecosystem. It fails to capture the well-hypothesized link between terrestrial runoff, subsequent nutrient plumes, and massive increases in COTS larval survival, which is considered a primary driver of outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef.

**Proposed Ecological Improvement:**
To create a more mechanistic and predictive model of outbreak initiation, I will replace the static `cotsimm_dat` input with a dynamic recruitment process. This new process will link the reproductive output of the local COTS population to an environmental driver representing nutrient runoff.

**Ecological Rationale & Implementation:**
The new formulation is based on the "larval starvation hypothesis." It posits that major runoff events increase nutrient availability, leading to phytoplankton blooms that provide ample food for COTS larvae, dramatically increasing their survival and recruitment rates.

1.  **New Data & Parameters:** An environmental driver for runoff is used to trigger outbreaks. To maintain compatibility with the existing data pipeline, this signal is passed to the model via the `cotsimm_dat` data vector. A corresponding parameter, `log_gamma_rec`, is used to control the strength of the runoff's effect on larval recruitment.
2.  **Structural Change:** The COTS population equation is modified so that recruitment is calculated as the product of the local population's reproductive output (already a function of coral consumption and an Allee effect) and a runoff-dependent larval survival term (sourced from `cotsimm_dat`).
3.  **Time Lag:** A one-year time lag will be included in the runoff effect, as nutrient runoff in one year influences the survival of larvae that settle and are counted as recruits in the following year.

This change replaces a static input with a dynamic feedback mechanism, allowing the model to endogenously generate outbreaks in response to environmental drivers, which directly addresses the project's goal of understanding outbreak triggers.
