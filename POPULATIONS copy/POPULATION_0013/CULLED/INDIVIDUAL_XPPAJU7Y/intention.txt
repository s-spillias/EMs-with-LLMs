Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating COTS-coral interactions. It correctly implements logistic growth for corals, selective COTS predation using a Holling Type II functional response, and key aspects of COTS population dynamics such as an Allee effect at low densities and density-dependent mortality at high densities.

However, the model's ability to capture the "boom-bust" nature of COTS outbreaks is limited by its representation of COTS reproduction. The current formulation uses a constant conversion efficiency (`e_C`) to translate consumed coral into new COTS biomass. This oversimplifies a complex process and, crucially, misses the strong influence of environmental conditions on COTS larval survival, which is widely recognized as a primary driver of outbreak events. The model can force an outbreak via the `cotsimm_dat` data stream, but it lacks an endogenous mechanism to trigger an outbreak based on favorable environmental conditions.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreaks, I will introduce an environmental modifier to COTS reproductive success based on sea surface temperature (SST). The constant conversion efficiency (`e_C`) will be replaced by an effective, temperature-dependent efficiency (`e_C_eff`).

Ecological Justification:
This change is justified by the strong empirical evidence that COTS larval development, survival, and settlement are highly sensitive to water temperature. There is an optimal thermal window for larval success; temperatures outside this window lead to increased mortality and reduced recruitment.

I will model this relationship using a Gaussian function, where reproductive success peaks at an optimal temperature (`T_opt_C`) and declines as temperatures become warmer or cooler. This modification directly links environmental variability (SST) to a key demographic rate, allowing the model to endogenously generate the "boom" phase of an outbreak when thermal conditions are favorable. This directly addresses the project context's requirement to model the triggers of episodic outbreaks.

This will be implemented by:
1.  Adding two new parameters: `T_opt_C` (optimal temperature for COTS reproduction) and `log_T_sd_C` (log of the width of the thermal tolerance window).
2.  Modifying the COTS growth equation in `model.cpp` to calculate an effective conversion efficiency `e_C_eff = e_C * f(SST)`, where `f(SST)` is the Gaussian temperature response.
