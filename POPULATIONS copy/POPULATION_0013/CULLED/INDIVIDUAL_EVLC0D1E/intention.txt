## Model Assessment

1.  **Fit to Data:** Without access to residuals, a direct assessment of model fit is not possible. Structurally, the model uses appropriate ecological formulations (logistic growth, Holling Type II predation) and statistical distributions (lognormal likelihood) for the system.

2.  **Alignment with Project Context:** The model simulates the core interactions between COTS and coral communities. It includes mechanisms for the "bust" phase of COTS outbreaks (density-dependent mortality) and uses an external data stream (`cotsimm_dat`) to drive the "boom". However, its reliance on this external driver to trigger outbreaks is a key simplification. The project's goal to model the *mechanisms* of outbreaks calls for a more endogenous trigger.

3.  **Missing or Oversimplified Processes:** The COTS mortality term (`m_C * C`) is linear, which is a simplification of predator-prey dynamics. The literature-updated value for `log_m_C` is high (0.8862), implying a strong, constant mortality pressure (`~2.42 year⁻¹`). This high rate would make it difficult for the population to grow without large external inputs and suggests the functional form of the equation may be inappropriate.

## Proposed Ecological Improvement

**Rationale:** To better capture the explosive "boom" phase of COTS outbreaks, I will introduce a **predator satiation** mechanism (a form of depensatory or inverse density-dependent mortality). This ecological theory posits that at low prey densities, predators can effectively control the prey population. However, as prey numbers increase, they overwhelm the predators' capacity to consume them. This causes the per-capita mortality rate to fall, allowing the prey population to "escape" control and grow exponentially. This provides a powerful, endogenous mechanism for triggering outbreaks, directly addressing a key goal of the project context.

**Implementation:**

1.  **New Mortality Structure:** The linear COTS mortality term (`m_C * C`) will be replaced with a non-linear function, `(m_pred * C) / (1 + (C / C_escape)²)`, that models predator satiation. The quadratic density-dependent term (`m_C_dd * C²`), which represents self-limiting factors like disease at high densities, will be retained to facilitate the "bust" phase.

2.  **Parameter Changes:**
    *   The existing parameter `log_m_C` will be repurposed as `log_m_pred`. It will now represent the maximum per-capita mortality rate from predation that occurs at very low COTS densities. Its high literature-derived value is ecologically consistent with this new role.
    *   A new parameter, `log_C_escape`, will be introduced. This parameter defines the COTS density threshold at which the population effectively "escapes" from predator control.

This change enhances ecological realism by incorporating a key theoretical mechanism for population outbreaks, providing a more dynamic and self-contained model that is better aligned with the project's objectives.
