Assessment and targeted improvement plan (COTS boom–bust model)

Data fit (preliminary)
- Residuals file not provided; this assessment is based on model structure and typical outbreak data characteristics.
- Structural expectations: The current model has mechanisms for rapid increases (immigration pulses, positive fecundity feedback via per-capita feeding, weak Allee release) and for slowing growth (density dependence via K from coral cover). However, adult mortality is constant (mA), so collapses after peaks are driven mainly by reduced recruitment (via depleted K) rather than elevated adult losses. This often produces declines that are too gradual compared to observed, sharp post-peak crashes.
- Anticipated residual patterns (to be verified with residuals):
  - Adults (cots): under-predicted peaks if immigration/recruitment pulses are damped; over-predicted persistence after peaks if adult mortality does not rise with food shortage; timing lag when crashes occur faster in data.
  - Corals: fast coral over-predicted post-outbreak if predation-driven mortality slows too early; slow coral sometimes over-predicted if predation pressure is underestimated.
  - SST effects: hump-shaped modifier likely helps but may not alone time the crash.

Project-context alignment
- The model captures key drivers of outbreaks: larval supply pulses (cotsimm_dat), positive feedback from food availability (fecundity boost via per-capita feeding), coral-dependent carrying capacity, and Allee effects at low density. These address triggers and growth phases.
- Missing/oversimplified for bust dynamics: No explicit resource-dependent adult mortality, disease/cannibalism, or predator aggregation with density. Without a mechanism for increased adult losses when food is scarce, declines can be too slow.

Key ecological processes review
- Included:
  - Coral-dependent carrying capacity (K_A).
  - Allee effect (Phi_A).
  - SST hump modifier on net growth.
  - Multi-prey functional response and predation feedback on corals.
  - Immigration with lagged kernel (captures episodic recruitment).
  - Fecundity boost from per-capita consumption.
- Potentially missing/oversimplified:
  - Adult starvation/disease mortality (density- or resource-dependent).
  - Stage-structure (cryptic juveniles), which is important but would add substantial complexity.
  - Predator control is contentious in the literature; including it risks overfitting without strong data support.

Parameter review highlights
- Many parameters have literature-aligned bounds; q_fr effectively constrains to Type II as per current choices (tight bounds).
- rA, kK_perc, and fecundity boost (eta_fec) enable strong booms given sufficient coral.
- mA is constant; its current formulation does not accelerate busts when coral is depleted.
- Given this, a structural adjustment to mortality is justified by updated ecological understanding: adult COTS experience elevated mortality under food shortage (starvation), which sharpens the outbreak collapse and is widely reported.

Chosen improvement: Resource-dependent adult mortality (one mechanism)
- Rationale: When per-capita consumption falls below a maintenance threshold, adult survival drops (starvation/disease), leading to rapid declines after peaks and post-depletion. This adds a feedback distinct from the recruitment-side control and aligns with observed sharp busts.
- Mathematical form (smooth, bounded, no data leakage):
  - Compute per-capita consumption at t-1: c_{pc} = (C_F + C_S)/(A_{t-1} + tiny) [yr^-1].
  - Additional mortality:
      mA_extra = mA_food * invlogit( (c_starve - c_{pc}) / c_starve_scale )
    where:
    - mA_food is the maximum additional mortality when severely food-limited (yr^-1).
    - c_starve is the per-capita consumption threshold for maintenance (yr^-1).
    - c_starve_scale controls transition steepness (yr^-1).
  - Effective adult mortality:
      mA_eff = mA + mA_extra
  - Adult update uses mortA = mA_eff * A_{t-1}.
- Properties:
  - If food is abundant (c_{pc} >> c_starve), mA_extra ~ 0 (no change).
  - If food is scarce (c_{pc} << c_starve), mA_extra ~ mA_food (mortality rises), promoting a sharp bust.
  - Smooth, differentiable, uses only previous-step states/forcings.

Expected benefits
- Sharper and earlier post-peak declines of adult density without needing implausibly large mA values.
- Better alignment with outbreak timing and duration when coral cover is heavily reduced during peaks.
- Minimal parameter overhead (3 parameters) with clear ecological meaning and identifiable effects.

Notes and next steps
- Please provide the residuals file or diagnostics so we can confirm whether adult declines are too slow and tune mA_food/c_starve accordingly.
- If residuals indicate peak underestimation instead, we would revisit eta_fec, gamma_I, or allow q_fr > 1 (Type III) with appropriate constraints.
- Stage-structure could be considered in a later iteration if residuals show multi-year lag patterns inconsistent with the current 0–2 y kernel.
