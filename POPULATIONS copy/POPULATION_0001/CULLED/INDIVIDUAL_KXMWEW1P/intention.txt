Assessment and rationale for ecological improvement

1) Model fit to data
- Quantitative assessment pending: residuals file not provided in this context. Please supply it so we can examine timing/magnitude/duration errors and potential autocorrelation in residuals for COTS and coral groups.
- Qualitative expectations from current structure:
  • COTS: The model includes immigration pulses with a smooth threshold, food limitation linked to edible coral, and logistic density dependence via a resource-modified carrying capacity. This can produce outbreaks but often yields declines that are too gradual after peaks, as only crowding and food limitation terminate the peak.
  • Corals: A Holling Type III response and diet preference are present and will emphasize losses of fast coral at intermediate/high edible coral. Coral growth is temperature-modulated with shared space limitation through K_c.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT (episodic boom–bust outbreaks)
- Strengths: Immigration trigger, food thresholds, and Type III predation create nonlinearity conducive to boom dynamics. Temperature dependence is modeled for all functional groups.
- Limitations: Outbreak collapses (busts) are frequently driven by outbreak-associated processes (e.g., disease, starvation, intraspecific interference) that accelerate mortality at high densities, beyond what logistic crowding and prey depletion capture. Without this mechanism, modeled busts may be too slow, lengthening outbreak duration and dampening the characteristic crash.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Outbreak-associated density-dependent mortality (disease/starvation) absent in the original formulation.
- No explicit algal competition or disturbance regimes (storms, bleaching) interacting with coral recovery; these are relevant but add complexity not essential for the single improvement requested.
- Immigration depends on a smooth threshold and temperature but not on external nutrient/runoff drivers (not included in available data), which is acceptable for now.

4) Review of parameter values and structural adequacy
- Several parameters are literature-informed (thermal optima and breadths, coral growth rates). These values are compatible with Gaussian thermal modifiers used.
- The presence of a food limitation threshold (E_thr, k_E) and a Type III response (logit_h_type3) is appropriate for selective predation dynamics.
- Placeholder-like elements: outbreak termination lacks a high-density mortality component. Updated ecological evidence from outbreak literature emphasizes disease and starvation at high densities; thus, the original structure is likely to overpredict outbreak duration.

Chosen improvement: outbreak-associated mortality module
- Approach category: higher-order nonlinearity and indirect feedback (density-dependent mortality) targeting bust dynamics.
- Mathematical form:
  m_eff = m_cots + m_disease * inv_logit(k_burst * (N_prev - N_burst_thr))
  where:
    • m_disease is the scale of additional mortality (year^-1),
    • N_burst_thr is the adult density threshold for mortality activation,
    • k_burst controls steepness.
- Implementation details:
  • Only previous-step state N_prev is used (no data leakage).
  • Replaces m_cots with m_eff in the adult update:
      N(t) = pos( N(t-1) + N(t-1) * [ r_max * f_food * f_T,COTS * (1 - N(t-1)/K_COTS) - m_eff ] + R_imm(t-1) )
  • Reports burst_mort_mod_pred(t) = inv_logit(k_burst*(N_prev - N_burst_thr)) for diagnostics.

Ecological justification
- Field observations report rapid post-peak collapses consistent with density-amplified disease, starvation, and cannibalism/interference. A smooth threshold preserves differentiability and allows inference on the onset density and intensity of these processes, improving timing and duration of the modeled crash.

Parameter additions (with bounds and rationale)
- log_m_disease (log year^-1): initial -0.693 (~0.5 yr^-1), bounds [-6.91, 1.10]; weak prior favors moderate added mortality while allowing near-zero if unsupported by data.
- N_burst_thr (ind m^-2): initial 0.3, bounds [0.05, 2.0]; informed by common outbreak density thresholds reported in surveys.
- k_burst ((m^2 ind^-1)): initial 10, bounds [0.1, 50]; allows flexible transition sharpness.

Next steps and diagnostics to review
- Please provide the residuals file. We will check:
  • Whether COTS residuals flip from persistent positive-after-peak (slow crash) to more balanced around zero.
  • Coral residuals for fast coral during peaks (should improve if busts shorten).
  • Autocorrelation reduction in COTS residuals during decline phases.
- Use burst_mort_mod_pred to verify that added mortality primarily activates at high densities and is quiescent otherwise.
