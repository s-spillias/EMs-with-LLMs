Assessment and rationale

1) Model fit to data
- Direct evaluation is not possible here because no residuals file was provided. Please share it to validate patterns quantitatively.
- Based on structure alone, the model likely responds too quickly from recruitment to adult abundance because recruits are added directly to adults each year. This can mis-time outbreak peaks relative to observations by 1–3 years and can inflate or dampen outbreak amplitude via compensatory parameter trade-offs.

2) Alignment with the project context
- Strengths: Includes selective predation on corals (Type II multi-prey), temperature effects on recruitment (Gaussian with T_opt), food effects from coral cover on both survival and recruitment, immigration forcing, bleaching impacts on coral mortality, and soft-bounded parameter penalties for ecological realism.
- Gaps: Key outbreak mechanism—delayed translation of larval pulses into adult populations via juvenile/subadult stages—is missing. This lag is central to the observed episodic, wave-like COTS outbreaks on the GBR.

3) Potentially oversimplified or missing processes
- Stage structure: No juvenile/subadult compartment or maturation delay; recruits become adults immediately.
- Additional considerations (not implemented here): episodic nutrient/flood pulses affecting larval survival, density-dependent feedbacks in recruitment at very high adult densities, management removals. These can be considered in later iterations.

Chosen improvement: Add a juvenile/subadult stage and maturation delay
- Ecological reasoning: COTS typically require 1–3 years to mature. Outbreak waves observed on the GBR emerge when strong larval pulses are followed by survival and maturation, not immediate adult increases. Introducing a juvenile compartment adds this lag without data leakage.
- Mathematical form:
  - Let J be juvenile density (inds/m^2).
  - Juveniles survive annually with probability sJ and mature with annual probability p_mature.
  - Recruits R (computed from t-1 drivers/states) flow into J; a fraction p_mature*sJ of J transitions to adults.
- Discrete-time updates (using only previous-year states/drivers):
  - J_t = (1 - p_mature) * sJ * J_{t-1} + R_{t-1}
  - C_t = surv_food * C_{t-1} + p_mature * sJ * J_{t-1}
- Benefits:
  - Introduces realistic lag between recruitment pulses and adult outbreaks, improving timing and potentially duration of peaks.
  - Reduces need for adult-level parameters to absorb timing errors, improving identifiability.
  - Maintains existing functional responses and environmental effects.

Parameter additions and bounds
- sJ (probability/year): juvenile survival prior to maturation. Suggested bounds 0.1–0.95 to reflect substantial but not perfect survival.
- p_mature (probability/year): annual maturation probability. Suggested bounds 0.1–0.9 to capture 1–3 year maturation times at annual resolution.
- J0 (inds/m^2): initial juvenile density at t0. Suggested bounds 0–5 to allow flexibility across sites.

Notes on existing parameter updates
- gS_max, s_min, A50, and T_opt were updated/narrowed from literature. The new stage structure is compatible with these constraints and helps prevent unrealistic exploitation of these parameters to fit outbreak timing.

Next steps
- Please provide the residuals file to confirm improvement in timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks. Inspect runs and lag structure in adult COTS residuals pre/post change. We can iterate on juvenile survival/maturation modifiers (e.g., temperature or food dependence) if residuals indicate remaining bias.
