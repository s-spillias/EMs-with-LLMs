Assessment and rationale

1) Fit to data (based on structure; residuals file not provided here)
- Without the residuals, I cannot quantify fit quality. Structurally, the model contains key mechanisms that should reproduce boom–bust COTS dynamics: positive density dependence (Allee effect), density dependence via a coral-dependent carrying capacity, exogenous immigration pulses (cotsimm_dat), and feedback through coral depletion reducing COTS carrying capacity.
- Please share the residuals so I can verify timing and magnitude mismatches (e.g., phase lag between observed and predicted outbreaks, peak overshoot, persistence after peaks).

2) Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths:
  - Outbreak-capable dynamics: Beverton–Holt-style recruitment with an Allee effect, plus food feedback, can create rapid increases when conditions align, followed by declines as coral is depleted and carrying capacity falls.
  - Selective predation: Multi-prey functional response with preference and handling captures higher pressure on fast-growing corals, consistent with COTS ecology and differential coral vulnerability.
  - Environmental stress on corals: Bleaching-linked mortality and growth suppression allow coral downturns that feed back onto COTS.
- Gaps relative to outbreak triggers:
  - Larval survival is known to be strongly non-linear with environment (notably SST and nutrients/chlorophyll). The current SST modifier is monotonic (tanh), which cannot create pulse-like, optimal-window recruitment conditions that are strongly peaked around a thermal optimum.
  - No explicit nutrient/chlorophyll driver of larval survival (often implicated in outbreak initiation) and no explicit maturation delay. These can both sharpen boom timing.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Non-monotonic larval survival vs SST (peaked around an optimum). Current tanh is monotonic and may smear outbreaks across multiple warm years rather than concentrating recruitment in the best year(s).
- External nutrient/chlorophyll pulses (e.g., runoff) directly affecting larval survival.
- Age/size structure or maturation delays (introduce delayed density dependence).
- Dynamic predation on COTS or targeted removals (not modeled).
- Density-dependent mortality beyond the simple linear term.
- Nonlinear dependence of COTS carrying capacity on coral composition (currently linear in % cover).

Parameter review highlights
- mA updated_from_literature = true with tightened bounds (0.39–0.74 yr^-1): suggests adult mortality is relatively well-constrained.
- rF updated_from_literature with bounds [0.1, 0.5] yr^-1: reasonable for fast corals.
- sst_bleach updated_from_literature = true (31.5 °C): bleaching onset is high and steepness controllable via sst_scale_bleach.
- The SST effect on COTS growth (beta_sst_A, sst_ref, sst_scale_A) is currently monotonic (tanh), which is not ideal given evidence for an optimal larval survival window. The parameter meanings remain fine, but the functional form should be changed to a hump-shaped (Gaussian-like) response around an optimum.

Chosen single improvement
- Replace the monotonic tanh-based SST modifier on COTS net growth with a hump-shaped Gaussian response around an optimal SST (sst_ref) with width sst_scale_A.
- Ecological justification: Larval survival is highest within a relatively narrow SST window and drops off at both cooler and hotter extremes. A Gaussian-shaped modifier localizes recruitment booms to years with near-optimal SST, improving timing and magnitude of outbreak pulses without requiring new parameters.
- Mathematical form:
  f_SST_A(t-1) = 1 + beta_sst_A * exp(-0.5 * ((sst_{t-1} - sst_ref)/(sst_scale_A + tiny))^2)
  - Keeps f_SST_A ≥ 1 if beta_sst_A ≥ 0 (enhanced growth near optimum, neutral otherwise).
  - Uses existing parameters; no new dimensionality or identifiability concerns.
  - If desired later, we can center baseline so that extremes are below 1 (e.g., 1 + beta * (2*exp(-0.5*z^2) - 1)) to enforce suppression at non-optimal temperatures; starting with the simpler enhancement-only form is safer.

Implementation notes
- Updated the comment and code for the SST modifier in model.cpp.
- Updated parameter descriptions in parameters.json to reflect the hump-shaped (Gaussian) interpretation of sst_ref and sst_scale_A and the amplitude role of beta_sst_A.
- No new parameters added; numerical bounds remain appropriate (sst_scale_A bounds 0.1–5 °C still sensible).
- All predictions continue to use only previous-step states and forcings; no data leakage added.

Next steps once residuals are available
- Check whether peaks are too early/late. If peaks persist too long, consider adding a mild maturation delay or stronger negative feedback when coral is low (e.g., make eta_A depend on coral availability).
- If outbreak initiation is still too diffuse, consider adding a nutrient/chlorophyll proxy as an additional hump-shaped modifier on recruitment.
