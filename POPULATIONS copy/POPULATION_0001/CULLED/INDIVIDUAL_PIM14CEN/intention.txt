Assessment of current model and justification for a single ecological improvement

1) Model fit to data (based on structure and expected residual patterns)
- Residuals file not provided in the chat, so the comments below are based on expected behavior given the current model structure and common issues seen in COTS boom–bust modeling.
- Likely issues:
  - Outbreak peaks too broad and busts too slow: With adult mortality composed of a constant term (mA) plus a smooth density-dependent term (mA_dd), predators can remain elevated even after prey depletion, leading to overly gradual declines.
  - Coral decline/recovery patterns may be too smooth: The current predation and coral dynamics are saturating and continuous; without a starvation feedback on COTS, the model may not produce the sharp post-peak crash seen in the field.
  - Timing mismatch around peaks: Because fecundity is boosted by per-capita consumption and immigration uses a short lag kernel, peaks may be captured, but the decline may lag observations.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths:
  - Captures multiple known mechanisms: Allee effect, SST-modulated recruitment, multi-prey functional response, immigration pulses, and bleaching impacts on corals.
  - Links feeding to fecundity (per-capita consumption boosts reproduction), which supports triggering/sustaining outbreaks.
  - Carrying capacity depends on coral cover, tying predator potential to prey availability.
- Gaps relative to episodic boom–bust:
  - Missing a starvation-induced mortality that accelerates declines when prey are depleted. Empirically, post-outbreak COTS often crash rapidly as coral cover collapses, indicating a strong food-limitation mortality pathway beyond baseline and high-density processes.

3) Key ecological processes potentially missing/oversimplified
- Starvation mortality tied to realized intake: Adult mortality does not currently increase when per-capita intake is low. This is a critical negative feedback to produce sharp busts following prey depletion.
- Predator interference (alternative): Not selected; while Beddington–DeAngelis responses can reduce per-capita feeding at high densities, they address interference rather than food scarcity and are less directly tied to the observed crash following prey loss.
- Environmental modulation of immigration: Could be added, but given immigration is already an exogenous driver, and the dominant shortfall is the speed of busts, starvation is prioritized.

Chosen single improvement: Add starvation-induced adult mortality driven by low per-capita consumption
- Rationale:
  - Directly addresses the rapid post-peak declines characteristic of COTS dynamics.
  - Uses an already computed, mechanistically meaningful quantity (percap_cons = (C_F + C_S) / A_prev).
  - Adds minimal complexity (two parameters) with smooth, well-behaved mathematics suitable for TMB/AD.
- Mathematical form:
  - Define a starvation mortality rate using a Hill function decreasing with per-capita consumption:
      mA_starv_rate = mA_starv_max * (cons_half^n) / (cons_half^n + percap_cons^n)
    where:
      - mA_starv_max (yr^-1) is the maximum starvation mortality rate at vanishing intake,
      - cons_half (yr^-1) is the intake at which starvation mortality is half-maximal,
      - n is a fixed Hill coefficient (n=2) providing a smooth but reasonably steep transition.
  - Add the resulting mortality to the adult COTS dynamics:
      A_next = clip(A_prev + recruit + immig_eff - mortA - mortA_dd - mortA_starv, tiny, +infty)

- Expected effects:
  - When coral is abundant, percap_cons is high, starvation term is near zero; dynamics reduce to the current formulation.
  - After intensive predation depletes coral, percap_cons falls, invoking larger starvation mortality and producing a faster, more realistic crash.
  - This strengthens the feedback linking prey depletion to predator decline, better capturing outbreak duration and bust timing.

Review of parameter values and structure
- No compelling evidence in the provided parameters necessitates changing existing functional forms, except for adding the starvation pathway. The q_fr parameter remains effectively Type II (q ≈ 1), consistent with current literature choices and the parameters.json constraints.
- Newly introduced parameters (mA_starv_max, cons_half_starv) are bounded to biologically plausible ranges and initialized conservatively.

Implementation summary
- Added two parameters:
  - mA_starv_max: maximum starvation mortality rate (yr^-1).
  - cons_half_starv: half-saturation per-capita consumption for starvation mortality (yr^-1).
- Implemented a smooth Hill-function starvation mortality driven by percap_cons.
- Maintained all safeguards: smooth clipping, no use of contemporaneous observations in state updates, and AD-safe operations.

If residuals later show remaining shortcomings (e.g., peak timing bias), additional targeted improvements could include modest predator interference in the functional response or environment-modulated immigration strength. For now, a single, well-justified food-limitation pathway is the most direct improvement toward the specified boom–bust dynamics.
