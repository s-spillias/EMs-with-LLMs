 +- Residuals file not provided in the chat, so the comments below are based on expected behavior given the current model structure and common issues seen in COTS      
 boom–bust modeling.                                                                                                                                                    
 +- Likely issues:                                                                                                                                                      
 +  - Outbreak peaks too broad and busts too slow: With adult mortality composed of a constant term (mA) plus a smooth density-dependent term (mA_dd), predators can    
 remain elevated even after prey depletion, leading to overly gradual declines.                                                                                         
 +  - Coral decline/recovery patterns may be too smooth: The current predation and coral dynamics are saturating and continuous; without a starvation feedback on COTS, 
 the model may not produce the sharp post-peak crash seen in the field.                                                                                                 
 +  - Timing mismatch around peaks: Because fecundity is boosted by per-capita consumption and immigration uses a short lag kernel, peaks may be captured, but the      
 decline may lag observations.

 +- Strengths:                                                                                                                                                          
 +  - Captures multiple known mechanisms: Allee effect, SST-modulated recruitment, multi-prey functional response, immigration pulses, and bleaching impacts on corals. 
 +  - Links feeding to fecundity (per-capita consumption boosts reproduction), which supports triggering/sustaining outbreaks.                                          
 +  - Carrying capacity depends on coral cover, tying predator potential to prey availability.                                                                          
 +- Gaps relative to episodic boom–bust:                                                                                                                                
 +  - Missing a starvation-induced mortality that accelerates declines when prey are depleted. Empirically, post-outbreak COTS often crash rapidly as coral cover       
 collapses, indicating a strong food-limitation mortality pathway beyond baseline and high-density processes.

 +3) Key ecological processes potentially missing/oversimplified                                                                                                        
 +- Starvation mortality tied to realized intake: Adult mortality does not currently increase when per-capita intake is low. This is a critical negative feedback to    
 produce sharp busts following prey depletion.                                                                                                                          
 +- Predator interference (alternative): Not selected; while Beddington–DeAngelis responses can reduce per-capita feeding at high densities, they address interference  
 rather than food scarcity and are less directly tied to the observed crash following prey loss.                                                                        
 +- Environmental modulation of immigration: Could be added, but given immigration is already an exogenous driver, and the dominant shortfall is the speed of busts,    
 starvation is prioritized.                                                                                                                                             
 +                                                                                                                                                                      
 +Chosen single improvement: Add starvation-induced adult mortality driven by low per-capita consumption                                                                
 +- Rationale:                                                                                                                                                          
 +  - Directly addresses the rapid post-peak declines characteristic of COTS dynamics.                                                                                  
 +  - Uses an already computed, mechanistically meaningful quantity (percap_cons = (C_F + C_S) / A_prev).                                                               
 +  - Adds minimal complexity (two parameters) with smooth, well-behaved mathematics suitable for TMB/AD.                                                               
 +- Mathematical form:                                                                                                                                                  
 +  - Define a starvation mortality rate using a Hill function decreasing with per-capita consumption:                                                                  
 +      mA_starv_rate = mA_starv_max * (cons_half^n) / (cons_half^n + percap_cons^n)                                                                                    
 +    where:                                                                                                                                                            
 +      - mA_starv_max (yr^-1) is the maximum starvation mortality rate at vanishing intake,                                                                            
 +      - cons_half (yr^-1) is the intake at which starvation mortality is half-maximal,                                                                                
 +      - n is a fixed Hill coefficient (n=2) providing a smooth but reasonably steep transition.                                                                       
 +  - Add the resulting mortality to the adult COTS dynamics:                                                                                                           
 +      A_next = clip(A_prev + recruit + immig_eff - mortA - mortA_dd - mortA_starv, tiny, +infty)

 +- Expected effects:                                                                                                                                                   
 +  - When coral is abundant, percap_cons is high, starvation term is near zero; dynamics reduce to the current formulation.                                            
 +  - After intensive predation depletes coral, percap_cons falls, invoking larger starvation mortality and producing a faster, more realistic crash.                   
 +  - This strengthens the feedback linking prey depletion to predator decline, better capturing outbreak duration and bust timing.

 +- No compelling evidence in the provided parameters necessitates changing existing functional forms, except for adding the starvation pathway. The q_fr parameter     
 remains effectively Type II (q ≈ 1), consistent with current literature choices and the parameters.json constraints.

 +If residuals later show remaining shortcomings (e.g., peak timing bias), additional targeted improvements could include modest predator interference in the functiona 
 response or environment-modulated immigration strength. For now, a single, well-justified food-limitation pathway is the most direct improvement toward the specified
