Assessment and rationale for model improvement

1) Fit to data (using residuals)
- Note: A residuals file was not included in the provided files, so I cannot directly inspect the patterns. The comments below focus on structural fit and likely residual patterns seen in similar systems.
- In boom-bust outbreak systems like COTS, typical residual issues include:
  • Under-prediction of rapid take-off (outbreak ignition)
  • Overly gradual peaks (insufficiently sharp outbreak crest)
  • Overly gradual declines (insufficient bust), or mis-timed collapse
  • Coral cover changes lagging observations due to weak trophic coupling
- The current model includes a stage structure (juveniles/adults), a multi-prey functional response, coral-dependent carrying capacity, and SST modifiers. This provides a strong foundation, but ignition and collapse thresholds may still be too smooth because fecundity increases linearly with adult density and only saturates mildly with density dependence and food.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model captures selective predation on fast/slow coral guilds via a multi-prey functional response and links feeding to fecundity (FEC_FEED), which is important.
- Juvenile-to-adult delay is represented, which can help produce oscillations.
- However, episodic outbreak ignition on the GBR is often linked to threshold-like increases in reproductive output when feeding conditions surpass an energetic threshold (e.g., high Acropora availability), and/or environmental pulses (nutrient/larval survival). The current fecundity boost uses a simple Michaelis-Menten form in per-capita feeding, which may be too gradual to reproduce sharp outbreak onsets.
- Bust phases (sharp declines after peaks) are partly driven by food depletion and possibly predation/management, but the current model may still produce smoother dynamics than observed due to the gentle shape of the fecundity boost.

3) Potentially missing or simplified processes
- Nutrient/river-runoff-driven larval survival pulses (key trigger of episodic outbreaks) are not explicitly represented; cotsimm_dat is currently an additive adult immigration term rather than a recruitment success multiplier.
- Predator control on adult COTS is not explicit; mA is constant (no predator feedback).
- Starvation-driven increases in adult mortality are not explicit; adult mortality does not depend on food.
- Spatial propagation/aggregation dynamics are absent (single-site model).
- Despite these, a minimal change that can materially improve episodicity is to make the fecundity response to feeding more threshold-like.

Chosen improvement: Hill-type (nonlinear) feeding-to-fecundity response
- Approach: Higher-order nonlinearity in the feeding-driven fecundity boost using a Hill exponent (ν ≥ 1). This sharpens the transition from low to high fecundity once per-capita feeding exceeds a threshold, creating ignition-like dynamics and helping match rapid outbreak onsets without introducing new exogenous data.
- Rationale: COTS gametogenesis and realized fecundity are strongly energy-dependent. When per-capita feeding is low, reproductive investment is minimal; once feeding surpasses a threshold, reproductive output increases sharply. A Hill function captures this ecologically plausible nonlinearity.
- Mathematical change:
  Old: FEC_FEED = 1 + β_feed_A * f / (f + K)
  New: FEC_FEED = 1 + β_feed_A * f^ν / (f^ν + K^ν)
  where f = per_cap_feed, K = feed_half_A, ν = nu_feed_A (new parameter, ν ≥ 1)

Expected effects
- Improves outbreak ignition timing and magnitude by creating a sharper transition into high recruitment when food becomes temporarily abundant (e.g., fast-coral availability).
- Maintains previous model structure and identifiability while adding only one parameter controlling steepness.
- Leaves the no-leakage principle intact (only previous-step predicted states feed the calculation).

Notes on alternatives considered (not implemented here)
- Redirect cotsimm_dat from adult addition to recruitment success multiplier (more realistic but deviates from current semantics).
- Add food-dependent adult mortality (starvation) to sharpen busts (also plausible, but chosen to keep the change minimal).
- Introduce predator feedback or runoff proxies (requires additional data/assumptions not included here).

Parameter review highlights
- Many parameters are “initial estimate” and could be weakly informed without residual diagnostics. The added Hill exponent (nu_feed_A) should be constrained to ν ∈ [1, ~6] to avoid pathologies while permitting threshold-like responses. Default ν = 2 is a common choice for sigmoidal saturation.

Implementation summary
- Added new parameter nu_feed_A with bounds [1, 6] and initial value 2.0.
- Replaced the fecundity_boost formula with the Hill-type function in both the time loop and the final-step reporting block.
- Added soft-bound penalties for nu_feed_A consistent with other parameters.
- No changes to data usage: only previous-step predictions are used, no current-step observations enter predictions.
