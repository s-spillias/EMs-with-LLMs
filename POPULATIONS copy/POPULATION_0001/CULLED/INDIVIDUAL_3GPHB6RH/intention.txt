Assessment and rationale for improvement

1) Model fit to data
- I do not have the residuals file in this chat, so I cannot quantitatively evaluate fit. Please provide the residuals to validate the assessment below.
- Structurally, the model is capable of fitting smooth trajectories and capturing hump-shaped SST effects and feeding feedbacks, but it may underpredict the speed and magnitude of collapses after outbreaks because adult mortality is constant and does not respond to prey scarcity. This often produces persistence of high COTS densities after coral declines.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model contains outbreak-enabling mechanisms: Allee effect (recruitment suppression at low density), coral-dependent carrying capacity (K_A), positive feedback via feeding (eta_A*(C_F+C_S)), functional response feeding on fast/slow corals, bleaching impacts on corals, and a saturating larval-supply multiplier.
- However, a key driver of busts—prey-limited adult mortality (starvation) as coral cover declines—is missing. Without this, the system can remain in high COTS states longer than observed and may not reproduce sharp declines following coral depletion.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Starvation mortality: empirically, adults suffer increased mortality when prey becomes scarce. Current mortality mA is constant.
- Potential overcompensation in density dependence (Ricker-type recruitment) could also be relevant, but the existing Beverton-Holt-like form combined with an SST/larval multiplier is reasonable if starvation mortality is included.
- Nutrient/runoff drivers of larval survival are not explicitly modeled (proxied by cotsimm_dat), which is acceptable given data constraints.

Chosen single improvement: prey-limited (starvation) adult mortality
- Ecological reasoning: As corals are consumed, prey availability falls and adult COTS experience increased mortality. This provides a strong negative feedback that produces the rapid “bust” following outbreak peaks, a hallmark of COTS dynamics.
- Mathematical form:
  coral_avail(t-1) = clamp01((wK_F*F_{t-1} + wK_S*S_{t-1}) / 100)
  mA_eff(t-1) = mA + mA_starve * (1 - coral_avail(t-1))
  mortA(t-1) = mA_eff(t-1) * A_{t-1}
  where clamp01 bounds the availability in [0,1]. This uses the same guild weights as used in K_A for parsimony.
- Justification for complexity: Adds one parameter (mA_starve), directly tied to a well-documented mechanism, and substantially improves outbreak collapse realism without introducing additional state variables or delays.

Notes on code updates
- Add new parameter mA_starve with soft bounds [0, 2] and report vectors for derived quantities if needed.
- Fix a minor bug: remove redundant temporary assignment of fast_pred(t) = S_next before it is corrected to F_next.

Next steps
- Please share the residuals. If collapses are still too slow or peaks too low/high after this change, we can consider an overcompensatory (Ricker/theta) density dependence for recruitment as a second step.
