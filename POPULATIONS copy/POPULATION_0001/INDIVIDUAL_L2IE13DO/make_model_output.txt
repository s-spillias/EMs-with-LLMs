 +- Residuals: A residuals file was not provided here, so a quantitative fit assessment is not possible in this context. Typical misfit symptoms for COTS models includ 
 (a) peaks occurring too early/late relative to observations, (b) underestimation of peak magnitude during outbreaks, and/or (c) outbreak tails that are too short or t 
 long relative to observed declines.                                                                                                                                    
 +- Structure strengths: The model already includes an Allee effect (mate limitation), temperature-modified growth (Gaussian around sst_ref), multi-prey functional     
 response on fast/slow corals, coral growth/mortality with bleaching, and exogenous larval immigration pulses with a short lag. It also links per-capita feeding to     
 fecundity.                                                                                                                                                             
 +- Gaps relative to PROJECT CONTEXT: Outbreaks in the GBR are widely associated with enhanced larval survival linked to nutrient pulses and post-disturbance habitat   
 conditions that increase juvenile survival (settlement on coralline algae, increased refuge/rubble after bleaching/cyclones). While exogenous immigration pulses       
 (cotsimm_dat) represent larval supply, the survival of settlers to the detectable adult stage is not currently modulated by habitat availability. The model therefore  
 may miss a key indirect feedback: when coral cover collapses (bleaching/predation), free space and rubble increase, boosting juvenile survival and enabling larger     
 subsequent outbreaks.

 +- Biological basis: COTS larvae settle on crustose coralline algae and juveniles initially feed on algal resources; post-disturbance rubble/space and CCA availabilit 
 can enhance survival until they switch to corals. This mechanism is documented in outbreak ecology and helps explain episodic pulses.                                  
 +- Model behavior: The saturating form prevents unbounded amplification (J_fac ≤ J_max), avoids non-differentiabilities, and keeps the effect dormant when space is    
 scarce (J_fac ≈ 1). It should:                                                                                                                                         
 +  - Amplify outbreaks following coral loss (better peak magnitude),

 +- Identifiability: If data do not support this mechanism, estimates will likely push J_max → 1 (disabling the effect). H_half trades off with J_max; prior            
 bounds/penalties help regularize.
