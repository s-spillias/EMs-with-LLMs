Assessment of current model (structural, pending residuals):
1) Fit to data:
   - Residuals file not provided here. Please supply it to quantify fit. Based on structure alone, expected behaviors include: (a) outbreaks triggered by immigration pulses and favorable SST via rA and f_SST_A, (b) growth limited by Beverton–Holt density dependence and coral-mediated K_A, (c) coral loss via functional response and bleaching.
   - Common misfit patterns in COTS outbreak models that rely on recruitment density-dependence alone: overly prolonged peaks, declines that are too gradual after peak, and mismatch in outbreak timing if linear immigration-to-adult conversion (gamma_I) under-represents thresholds.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT:
   - The model includes key drivers: larval immigration (with a 1-year lag mixture), a hump-shaped SST modifier, multi-prey feeding on fast/slow corals with handling saturation, and coral bleaching impacts.
   - It captures important feedbacks: COTS reduce coral; coral determines COTS carrying capacity; SST influences both corals and COTS recruitment.
   - Gap for “boom–bust” realism: The “bust” phase often occurs rapidly when prey availability collapses after an outbreak. Current adult mortality (mA) is constant and does not respond to food scarcity, so declines may be too slow, especially if K_A remains non-zero due to residual coral or kK0 baseline.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes:
   - Food-limited (starvation) adult mortality: Outbreaks deplete coral prey; low per-capita feeding increases adult mortality and accelerates declines.
   - Threshold-like translation of larval supply to recruits: gamma_I is linear; some reefs exhibit threshold responses (nutrient/runoff effects). This could be explored later via a sigmoidal or Hill-type immigration efficiency.
   - Explicit juvenile/cryptic stage: Currently approximated via rho_lag_I; a full stage-structured model would add realism but more complexity.

Chosen single improvement: Resource-limited adult mortality (environmental modifier via per-capita feeding)
Rationale:
- Directly targets the duration and magnitude of the “bust” after peak abundance, improving outbreak cycle realism without adding new state variables.
- Uses existing model quantities (per-capita consumption derived from functional response and previous states), avoiding data leakage and keeping complexity minimal.
- Ecologically justified: Starfish facing prey scarcity experience increased mortality (starvation, movement costs, predation risk).

Mathematical form added (applies at time t using t-1 states):
- Define per-capita consumption:
  percap_cons = (C_F + C_S) / (A_{t-1} + tiny)
- Starvation activation (0..1):
  starve_mult = invlogit(k_starve * (c_starve50 - percap_cons))
- Adult mortality becomes:
  mortA = (mA + mA_starve * starve_mult) * A_{t-1}
- This augments equation (6) so that low percap_cons increases mortality toward mA + mA_starve; at high percap_cons, mortality approaches mA.

New parameters (added to parameters.json):
- mA_starve (yr^-1): maximum added starvation mortality. Bounds [0, 3].
- c_starve50 (yr^-1): per-capita consumption at which starvation is half-max. Bounds [0, 3].
- k_starve (dimensionless): steepness of starvation activation. Bounds [0, 50].

Notes on existing parameters and ranges:
- q_fr constrained to ~1 forces a Type II response; acceptable for now but consider freeing slightly if residuals show under/overshoot at low coral.
- sst_ref tightly bounded (28–29 °C). If residuals suggest phase/timing mismatch across warm/cool years, consider widening this range.
- kK0 > 0 allows non-zero K at low coral; starvation mortality counters unrealistic persistence during prey scarcity.

Validation plan once residuals are available:
- Check whether post-peak declines become too steep or appropriately match observed bust durations.
- Compare outbreak timing and magnitude; if onset remains too gradual, consider a later enhancement: non-linear immigration efficiency (e.g., Hill function) or a juvenile stage with maturation delay.
- Examine coral residuals to ensure added COTS mortality does not create unrealistic coral rebounds (adjust kappa_pred*, rF/rS if needed).

Data leakage avoidance:
- All new terms depend only on t-1 state variables and exogenous inputs; no use of contemporaneous observations.

Please provide the residuals file to confirm improvements or guide further refinements.
