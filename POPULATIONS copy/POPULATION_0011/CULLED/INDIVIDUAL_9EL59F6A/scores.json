  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (uptake\u2192P growth, grazing\u2192Z growth, mortality, and nutrient mixing) but uses different, more mechanistic/parameterized functional forms than the TRUTH script. Nutrient uptake/growth is represented as a Hill/Monod nutrient term times an explicit saturating light term and Q10 temperature scaling (alternate to the TRUTH algebraic factors). Grazing is a Holling-type sigmoidal response with a Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference denominator (richer than TRUTH's simple P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). Recycling is present (including unassimilated grazing and remineralized mortality) and mixing of nutrients to a deep pool matches TRUTH structurally. A notable omission relative to TRUTH is an explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment term in dP. Several extra ecological processes are present (temperature Q10, explicit light & self-shading, BD interference, explicit yield and quadratic mortality terms).",
