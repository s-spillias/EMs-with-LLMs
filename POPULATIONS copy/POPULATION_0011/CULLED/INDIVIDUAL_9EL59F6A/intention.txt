Assessment and rationale

1) Fit to data
- Residuals file was not provided in this chat, so I cannot quantify goodness-of-fit. Please share residuals or summarize their patterns (e.g., seasonal biases, phase errors, amplitude mismatches in N/P/Z) to refine this assessment.
- Conceptually, the current structure can generate underprediction of phytoplankton growth at moderate nutrient levels due to a redundant double nutrient limitation (Monod × logistic threshold). This can translate to negative P residuals during bloom onset and/or overly slow recovery after depletion.

2) Alignment with project context
- The model is an NPZ mixed-layer system with light limitation, temperature modifiers, zooplankton functional response (Holling-type with Beddington–DeAngelis interference), mixing to a deep nutrient reservoir, and lognormal observation errors.
- This is well aligned with the goal of simulating N, P, Z concentrations in the mixed layer and their basic dynamical behavior.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Redundant nutrient limitation: Combining a Monod term with a separate logistic threshold on N creates identifiability and realism issues. It effectively applies two nutrient “gates,” which can suppress growth excessively and confound K_N, N_thr, thr_steep, and mu_max.
- Possible future refinements (not implemented here):
  - Temperature dependence of mortality/excretion terms (mP1, mZ1, mZ2).
  - Seasonality in light or mixing (I0, k_Ibg) or explicit MLD dynamics.
  - Variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency (e_Z) with temperature or food conditions.
  - Detrital pool to represent delayed remineralization (beyond NPZ scope for now).

Chosen improvement

- Replace the Monod × logistic threshold for nutrients with a single generalized Monod/Hill limitation:
  fN = N^hN / (K_N^hN + N^hN), with a new parameter hN (dimensionless; bounds 1–4).
- Ecological justification:
  - Hill-type uptake reflects cooperativity/multi-step transport and captures a steeper onset of growth at low N without imposing a second, arbitrary threshold.
  - Reduces parameter confounding between K_N, N_thr, thr_steep, and mu_max, improving identifiability and potentially fit stability.
  - Maintains smoothness and numerical stability required for AD-based optimization.
- Expected effects:
  - Sharper but single nutrient limitation can improve bloom onset timing and amplitude when N recovers, while avoiding over-suppression at moderate N.
  - Simplifies parameter space and may reduce correlations among nutrient-related parameters.

Parameter changes

- Removed:
  - N_thr: Smooth nutrient threshold center (redundant given Hill form).
  - thr_steep: Threshold steepness (redundant given Hill form).
- Added:
  - hN (dimensionless), Hill exponent for nutrient limitation.
    - Initial value: 2.0
    - Suggested bounds: lower_bound=1.0, upper_bound=4.0
    - Justification: 1 recovers classic Monod; values up to ~4 allow threshold-like behavior without becoming too switch-like.

Model implementation

- model.cpp:
  - Removed N_thr and thr_steep parameters and computations of fN_thr.
  - Implemented Hill nutrient limitation (fN).
  - Updated phytoplankton growth to use fN * fI.
  - Added penalties for hN; removed penalties for N_thr and thr_steep.
  - Updated diagnostics to report fN_last instead of fN_thr_last.
- parameters.json:
  - Removed N_thr and thr_steep definitions.
  - Added hN with description, bounds, and rationale.

Next steps

- Please provide the residuals file or a summary of residual patterns. After refitting with the new structure, we can:
  - Inspect whether biases in low-N periods or bloom initiation are reduced.
  - Revisit K_N and hN for plausibility and posterior correlations.
  - Consider targeted additions (e.g., temperature-sensitive mortality or seasonal light/mixing) if residuals suggest remaining structural bias.
