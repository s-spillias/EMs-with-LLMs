  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model that captures the canonical roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing losses, mortality; zooplankton growth and mortality). However, the mathematical forms differ from the TRUTH implementation in many places: nutrient uptake is implemented as a Hill/Michaelis\u2013Menten type limitation combined with an explicit light-saturation term (fI) and a yield parameter, grazing is a Holling-type (general exponent) with Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference, and zooplankton growth is computed as assimilated grazing rather than the TRUTH's fixed prefactor times the grazing functional form. Several extra ecological parameterizations are present (temperature/Q10 modifiers; explicit yield y_PN; BD interference; explicit quadratic P/Z mortality terms). Overall the candidate matches all ecological roles but mostly via alternate, literature-supported formulations rather than being algebraically identical to the TRUTH model.",
