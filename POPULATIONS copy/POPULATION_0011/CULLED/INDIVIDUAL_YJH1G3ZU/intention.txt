ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL (STRUCTURE-FOCUSED; RESIDUALS NOT PROVIDED)
- Data fit: A quantitative assessment requires the residuals you referenced. They were not included in this context, so I cannot compute diagnostics here. Typical checks to run after fitting: seasonality in residuals (phase and amplitude), bias in warm/cold seasons, and error variance structure across N, P, Z.
- Relevance to project context: The NPZ structure with Monod nutrient limitation, saturating light limitation, seasonal light/temperature forcing, Holling-type grazing (with order h), remineralization, and mixing is appropriate for an oceanic mixed layer setting. The model already prevents data leakage by using previous-step states only.
- Potentially missing or oversimplified processes:
  1) Single temperature modifier shared by growth and grazing/metabolism can misrepresent trophic decoupling: in nature, zooplankton metabolic rates typically have higher temperature sensitivity than phytoplankton growth.
  2) Light limitation uses a simple saturating function; photo-inhibition at high light is not represented (may or may not be necessary).
  3) Assimilation efficiency (beta) is constant; it sometimes varies with temperature or food quality (beyond scope for now).
  4) Mortality temperature dependence is not explicit; zooplankton mortality often increases with temperature.

PARAMETER REVIEW
- No parameters are flagged as updated_from_literature (all false). Current values are ecologically plausible first estimates for a mixed-layer NPZ system.
- Notes:
  - y_P is dimensionless; description mentions “g P per g N consumed, C-based”. Ecologically, this represents a C-based yield (biomass produced per nutrient consumed); we keep it dimensionless with suggested bounds [0.3, 2].
  - Temperature sensitivity previously used a single Q10. Literature commonly supports different Q10s for phytoplankton growth vs zooplankton processes (e.g., Q10_P ~1.5–2.0; Q10_Z ~2.0–3.0 for ingestion and metabolic losses).

ONE MEANINGFUL ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT CHOSEN
- Approach: Environmental modifiers of processes (temperature), by separating temperature sensitivities by trophic level.
- Rationale: Distinct Q10 values for phytoplankton growth (Q10_P) and zooplankton processes (Q10_Z) reflect well-established metabolic scaling differences. Allowing higher temperature sensitivity for zooplankton often improves seasonal dynamics: warmer periods see faster grazing and metabolic losses relative to production, potentially reducing warm-season over-prediction of P or correcting phase lags in Z.
- Mathematical changes:
  - Define Theta_T_P = Q10_P^((T - T_ref)/10) for phytoplankton growth.
  - Define Theta_T_Z = Q10_Z^((T - T_ref)/10) for zooplankton processes.
  - Apply Theta_T_P to rP only.
  - Apply Theta_T_Z to grazing rate g_fun, zooplankton excretion ex_z, and both linear and quadratic zooplankton mortality (mzl, mZq).
  - Keep phytoplankton mortality temperature-independent in this step to limit complexity.
- Expected impact on residuals (post-fit):
  - Reduced warm-season positive residuals of P if previously overpredicted (due to stronger temperature-driven grazing and Z losses).
  - Improved timing and amplitude of Z peaks via temperature-dependent ingestion and mortality.
  - Potentially improved N seasonal drawdown patterns via altered balance of U_N and N_remin.

PARAMETER FILE UPDATES
- Remove single Q10 and add:
  - Q10_P (dimensionless): lower_bound 1.0, upper_bound 3.5, initial 1.8.
  - Q10_Z (dimensionless): lower_bound 1.0, upper_bound 3.5, initial 2.0.
- Keep T_ref, T_amp, phi_T unchanged.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (MODEL.CPP)
- No data leakage: all rates use previous-step states and environmental drivers at the previous time index.
- AD-safe numerics maintained (softplus, positive_part, eps offsets).
- Bounds penalties added for the two new Q10 parameters; the old single Q10 parameter is removed.
- ADREPORT now includes Q10_P and Q10_Z.

NEXT STEPS (AFTER YOU PROVIDE RESIDUALS)
- Refit and inspect residuals by season (e.g., warm vs cold half-year), by state (N, P, Z), and check for variance mis-specification.
- If residuals still show light-driven misfit at high irradiance, consider a photo-inhibition term or mixed-layer depth effects.
- If Z residuals remain biased, consider making beta temperature-dependent or including a low-food feeding threshold.
