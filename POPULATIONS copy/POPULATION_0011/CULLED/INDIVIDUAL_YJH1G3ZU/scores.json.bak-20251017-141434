  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ model with the same broad ecological roles as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth/mortality). However the candidate uses different mathematical forms and additional processes: uptake is implemented as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation and temperature Q10 modifiers (so growth = mu_max * LN * LI * P), grazing is a Holling-type saturating function with a tunable exponent h, recycling is routed as unassimilated grazing plus mortality fractions, and mixing is a linear relaxation on nutrients (same as TRUTH). Several extra ecological components appear (explicit seasonal light forcing, Q10 temperature modifiers, explicit excretion term, stoichiometric yield parameter, explicit quadratic mortality terms). Overall the candidate matches TRUTH in function but generally as alternates from the literature rather than exact algebraic matches, except for the nutrient mixing term which is essentially identical.",
