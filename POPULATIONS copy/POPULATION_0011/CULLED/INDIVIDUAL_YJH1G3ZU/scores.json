  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ with the canonical uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling and nutrient mixing processes. It uses Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (seasonal forcing) and Q10 temperature modifiers on rates. Grazing is implemented as a Hill/Holling function with a flexible order h (so it can match TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) when h=2). The candidate adds explicit stoichiometric yield, quadratic mortality terms, and explicit temperature & seasonal-light forcing that are not present in the simple TRUTH NPZ. The model omits explicit mixing terms for P and Z (TRUTH included a P-mixing-like loss term as part of -(s+k)*P). Overall the candidate matches most canonical components but with several common alternate/extended formulations (temperature, seasonal light, yield, quadratic mortality).",

This is the usual recycling from unassimilated grazing and routed mortality. TRUTH has recycling terms (e.g. beta*lambda_*P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z and gamma*q*Z) but the parameterization differs; the candidate's form is conceptually similar but not identical to the TRUTH algebra, so rated as similar but not one of the enumerated alternates."
