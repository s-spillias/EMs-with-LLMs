  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, a Hill/Holling grazing functional response, recycling of grazed and mortality biomass back to nutrients, and an external nutrient exchange term. It departs from the TRUTH model by adding explicit seasonal light and temperature (Q10) modulators on primary production and by including quadratic zooplankton mortality; it also uses a Hill exponent parameter for grazing (generalizing the fixed exponent-2 form in TRUTH). Several functional forms are alternate rather than exact matches to TRUTH (e.g., uptake and grazing kernels differ), while basic closures (mixing of N, recycling, linear phytoplankton mortality) are present.",
