  "individual": "INDIVIDUAL_EY3XGSDZ",
  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure: nutrients are taken up by phytoplankton via a Michaelis\u2013Menten type uptake, phytoplankton grow and are lost to grazing and linear mortality, zooplankton grow from grazing with an assimilation term and suffer mortality, and nutrients are replenished by recycling and by an external mixing reservoir. It differs from the TRUTH NPZ in the functional families for some processes (Hill/Holling-type grazing vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form, explicit temperature (Q10) and seasonal light multipliers on growth, and inclusion of quadratic zooplankton mortality). Numerically the candidate uses forward Euler stepping with smooth positivity and has an observation model; these numerical/observation features are extra to the ecological equations in TRUTH.",
