  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ-like dynamical model with all three state equations and most canonical processes present, but it uses more mechanistic/alternative formulations than the TRUTH code. Nutrient uptake/growth is represented as a Hill/Monod-style nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light limitation (smooth Liebig min), rather than the single combined algebraic factor in TRUTH. Grazing is a saturating Holling-like functional response with an added Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference term and separate assimilation efficiency (implemented as e_Z * grazing), which corresponds to the same ecological roles as TRUTH but via alternate functional families. The candidate also adds several processes not present in the TRUTH NPZ (temperature Q10 scaling for rates, explicit irradiance/self-shading light formulation, a yield parameter linking uptake to growth, and explicit quadratic mortality terms). Numerical smoothing and an Euler-forward integrator are present but are numerical, not ecological.",
