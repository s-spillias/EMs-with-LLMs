 1 Do we need code changes?                                                                                                                     

 • Yes. I propose one structural ecological improvement: replace multiplicative co-limitation of growth by nutrient and light with a smooth     
   Liebig-style minimum. This better reflects resource limitation in mixed layers and can reduce unrealistic growth when both resources are     
   moderately limiting.                                                                                                                         

 2 What changes and why?                                                                                                                        

 • Replace P growth term P_growth = mu_max * theta_mu * fN * fI * P with P_growth = mu_max * theta_mu * min_smooth(fN, fI) * P. This requires no
   new parameters, preserves differentiability for AD and optimization, and directly targets common misfits where multiplicative co-limitation  
   overestimates growth under co-limitation.                                                                                                    
 • Add a small helper smooth_min to keep the objective smooth.                                                                                  
 • Keep everything else unchanged (no data leakage; same observation model).                                                                    
 • Update intention.txt with assessment, justification, and documentation.                                                                      
 • No parameters.json changes are required, since we did not add parameters.

 +  - Multiplicative form can suppress growth excessively when both resources are moderate, and can inflate growth when one is actually limitin 
 +  - The smooth-min preserves differentiability for optimization and makes no new parameters necessary.
