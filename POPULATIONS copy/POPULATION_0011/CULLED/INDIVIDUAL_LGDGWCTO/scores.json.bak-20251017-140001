  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Monod-type nutrient limitation, an explicit grazing functional response, mortality terms, and an explicit mixing/entrainment term. It departs from the TRUTH formulation by adding seasonality (explicit light forcing) and temperature (Q10) modifiers on rates, using a generalized Holling-form grazing with tunable exponent h, and including linear+quadratic mortalities and an explicit excretion term. Many ecological roles from TRUTH are present but implemented with alternate (widely used) functional forms and extra processes (temperature and light forcing, quadratic mortality, separated excretion).",
