  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ-style model with the same ecological roles as the TRUTH model (uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing, mortality, assimilation). Most components are present but several are implemented as common alternates: Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake combined with an explicit light-limitation (self-shading + saturating f(I)), generalized Holling-type grazing (P^h/(K^h+P^h)) with assimilation efficiency, and linear+quadratic mortality terms. The candidate also adds explicit temperature/Q10 scaling of rates and a smooth threshold gating of nutrient limitation that are not in the TRUTH formulation. Physical mixing of nutrients is present and matches TRUTH form, but an explicit mixing loss for phytoplankton (present in TRUTH as lumped (s+k)*P) is absent in the candidate (mixing only appears in dN). Numerical safeguards, soft penalties and a yield parameter (y_PN) appear but are implementation/parameter choices rather than new ecological state variables.",
