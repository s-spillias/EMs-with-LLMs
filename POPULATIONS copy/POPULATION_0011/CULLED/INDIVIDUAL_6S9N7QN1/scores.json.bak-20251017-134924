  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ dynamics set that captures the same functional roles as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing, mortality; Z growth and mortality). However it does so with richer/alternative functional forms: Monod uptake is present but multiplied by an explicit seasonal environmental modifier and a different self-shading factor; grazing is a generalized Holling-III with a smooth prey refuge/threshold and tunable exponent; recycling is split into several explicit routes (growth inefficiency, egestion, mortality remobilization). The candidate also adds density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality. Overall the candidate matches TRUTH in role and many specific terms, but differs in mathematical detail and adds extra ecological processes (seasonality, explicit routing, prey-refuge, quadratic Z mortality).",
