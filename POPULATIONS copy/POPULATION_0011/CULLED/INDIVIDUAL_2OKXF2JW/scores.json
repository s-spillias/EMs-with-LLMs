  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ dynamical model that includes the core processes of nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling, and mixing, but does so with a richer set of ecological modifiers (seasonal light, temperature Q10 factors, yield, excretion, and optional quadratic mortalities). Many TRUTH processes are present as a member of the same family (e.g., Holling-type grazing, Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation), though the algebraic forms differ in places (candidate uses multiplicative light limitation and Q10 temperature modifiers; TRUTH does not). Physical mixing of nutrients is implemented identically in form. The candidate also omits explicit physical loss/mixing terms for P and Z that appear in TRUTH (i.e., there is no k*(P_ext - P) or -k*P term), and uses slightly different routing of recycled fluxes (explicit rho_P, rho_Z, excretion, and (1-beta) routing). Overall: matching ecological roles are present, several components are ALTERNATE formulations from the literature, and additional ecological modifiers (light, temperature, yield, excretion, quadratic mortality) are included that are not in the TRUTH model.",
