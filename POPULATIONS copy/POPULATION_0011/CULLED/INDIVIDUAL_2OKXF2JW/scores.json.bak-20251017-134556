  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ architecture and includes all core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing loss and mortality; zooplankton growth and mortality). Many processes are present but parameterized differently or extended relative to the TRUTH Python NPZ. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are expressed as Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light limitation and Q10 temperature multipliers (these light/temperature modifiers are not present in the TRUTH model). Grazing is implemented as a general Holling-type functional response (P^h/(K^h+P^h)) which includes the TRUTH h=2 form as a special case. Recycling and mortality are present but routed and split differently (explicit excretion, quadratic mortality, rho routing fractions). Physical mixing is implemented as a linear relaxation for nutrients (matching TRUTH), but there is no explicit phytoplankton mixing term in the candidate (unlike the TRUTH model which applies a linear loss for P via (s+k)*P). Overall the candidate could reproduce the TRUTH functional forms by fixing parameters (e.g., h=2, Theta=1, quadratic mortality=0) but it also adds several extra ecological processes (seasonal light, temperature Q10 modifiers, explicit excretion, quadratic mortality, explicit yield parameter).",
