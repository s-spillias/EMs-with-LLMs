Fix: Compilation failed because parameters referenced in model.cpp were missing from parameters.json. Added the missing parameters (beta, mPl, mPq, mzl, mZq, ex_z, rho_P, rho_Z, k_mix, N_ext, log_sigma_N, log_sigma_P, log_sigma_Z) with initial values and bounds consistent with model.cppâ€™s soft penalties. No changes to model.cpp were necessary.
