  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ-style model with the same three state variables and the same high-level flows (nutrient uptake \u2192 P growth, grazing \u2192 Z growth, recycling, and mixing). However the functional forms differ in many places: the candidate uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient saturation multiplied by an explicit smooth nutrient-threshold gating, an explicit light limitation with self-shading, Q10 temperature scalings, a flexible Holling-type grazing with exponent and Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference, explicit stoichiometric yield (y_PN), and linear+quadratic mortality terms. Some TRUTH terms map directly (mixing of N; grazing-driven Z growth as assimilation of ingestion), while others are alternate formulations of the same ecological role. Notably, an explicit mixing term for phytoplankton present in TRUTH ((s + k)*P) is missing in the candidate.",
