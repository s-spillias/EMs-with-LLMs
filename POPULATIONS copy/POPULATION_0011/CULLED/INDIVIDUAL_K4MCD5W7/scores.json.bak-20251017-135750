  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ model with the canonical uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality and mixing roles present. Many terms are algebraically different from the TRUTH Python NPZ (which is a specific functional choice) but represent the same ecological roles. Key differences: the candidate uses Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient limitation coupled multiplicatively with an explicit seasonal light limitation and a Q10 temperature multiplier for biological rates; grazing is a Holling-type formulation with an exponent h and Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference; mortality includes linear + quadratic terms; mixing of nutrients is implemented as a relaxation to an external concentration. Thus most canonical components are present as either TRUTH-equivalent forms or literature alternates. The candidate also adds explicit seasonal light and temperature modifiers (processes not present in TRUTH).",
