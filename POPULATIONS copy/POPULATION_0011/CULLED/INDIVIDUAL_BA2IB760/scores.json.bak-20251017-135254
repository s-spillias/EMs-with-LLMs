  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a mechanistic NPZ with the canonical core processes: Monod nutrient uptake modulated by self-shading, phytoplankton growth as a fraction (yield) of uptake, Holling-type grazing driving ingestion and zooplankton growth with assimilation efficiency, linear phytoplankton mortality, and explicit nutrient recycling and mixing. Many functional forms are algebraically equivalent or closely analogous to the TRUTH model (Monod uptake and a 1/(1 + aP) light/shading term are effectively the same family as TRUTH's a/(b + cP)), but the candidate generalizes grazing (Holling-III with tunable exponent and an explicit prey-refuge threshold), adds seasonal environmental modulation (multiplicative M_env), and includes quadratic zooplankton mortality and multiple explicit remineralization pathways. The candidate also discretizes dynamics with forward Euler and enforces positivity with softplus (numerical/statistical choices, not ecological processes).",
