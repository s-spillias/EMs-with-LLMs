  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with all major ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing losses, mortality; zooplankton growth and mortality). However the mathematical forms differ in many places from the TRUTH Python NPZ. Several components are implemented as plausible alternates (e.g., Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation combined with explicit light limitation and a smooth threshold for growth; Holling-type grazing with Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference; explicit assimilation efficiency and remineralization fractions). Some TRUTH terms are reproduced closely (the linear mixing/entrainment term for nutrients), but the candidate omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing term present in TRUTH and adds extra mechanistic modifiers (temperature Q10, light self-shading, soft thresholds, and quadratic mortality). Overall the candidate is ecologically complete but uses alternate functional forms for many canonical processes.",
