  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing losses, mortality; zooplankton growth and mortality) but generally with alternative mathematical choices and several added processes. Uptake/growth use a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term combined with explicit light limitation, a smooth nutrient-threshold gate, Q10 temperature scaling, and a yield factor converting P_growth into N_uptake (alternate to the TRUTH algebraic form). Grazing is a Holling-type form with exponent h and Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference, rather than the simple P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH. Recycling is present but assembled from explicit linear and quadratic loss terms plus unassimilated grazing. Mixing is implemented in N exactly as in TRUTH. Several extra mechanisms (temperature/Q10 effects, explicit irradiance + self-shading, Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference, smooth nutrient gating, explicit quadratic mortality terms and an explicit yield parameter) are present that are not in the TRUTH model.",
