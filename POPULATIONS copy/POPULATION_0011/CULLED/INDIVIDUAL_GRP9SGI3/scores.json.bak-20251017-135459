  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ with the core ecological roles present (nutrient uptake driving P growth, grazing transferring biomass to Z, recycling to N, and mixing). Many processes are formulated as standard ecological alternatives (Monod nutrient limitation, Holling grazing with flexible exponent, multiplicative light limitation) rather than the exact algebra used in the TRUTH script. The candidate also adds several realistic extras (seasonal light forcing, Q10 temperature multiplier, temperature-sensitive assimilation efficiency, explicit quadratic mortality terms and an excretion loss), and uses an Euler stepping discrete-time update rather than the continuous-time ODE form in TRUTH. Overall: core functions are present and map well to literature alternatives; a few TRUTH-specific terms (e.g., explicit P mixing/sinking routed as a P loss) are not represented exactly, and one bookkeeping mismatch (zooplankton excretion is not routed into N_remin) is present.",
