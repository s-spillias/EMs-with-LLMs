  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same high-level ecological roles as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing loss, mortality, mixing; zooplankton growth and mortality). However, the functional forms differ in many places: the candidate uses a separated P_growth \u2192 N_uptake (with a Michaelis\u2013Menten N-term multiplied by light and a smooth nutrient gating), explicit light limitation with self-shading, Q10 temperature scaling, a flexible Holling-type grazing with exponent + Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference, explicit linear + quadratic mortalities, and explicit yield and remineralization fractions. Some terms are direct algebraic matches (e.g., linear mixing of N to a deep pool), others map to alternate families in the literature (e.g., Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling-type grazing, linear+quadratic mortality). Overall the candidate is ecologically complete relative to TRUTH but uses richer/alternate parameterizations for many components.",
