  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same core mass flows as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth -> grazing -> zooplankton growth -> recycling -> mixing), but it uses alternate mathematical choices and several additional processes. Nutrient uptake/growth is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten N-saturation multiplied by extra gate/limitation factors (a smooth nutrient threshold, explicit light limitation with self-shading and Q10 temperature scaling) rather than the single N/(e+N) * a/(b + cP) factor in TRUTH. Grazing is a Holling-style saturating function with an exponent and a Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference denominator (and temperature scaling), which generalizes the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing. Recycling and mortality are handled by explicit linear+quadratic loss terms and specified remineralization fractions. Physical mixing/entrainment of nutrients is the same structure as TRUTH, and phytoplankton mixing is present as a linear dilution term; the candidate also applies a linear dilution to zooplankton (TRUTH did not). Overall: same ecological roles are present, many as alternates to the TRUTH functional forms, plus several extra ecological mechanisms (temperature/Q10, light + self-shading, threshold gating, BD interference, quadratic mortality, stoichiometric yield, zooplankton dilution).",
