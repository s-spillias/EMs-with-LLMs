  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with the same high-level roles as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing and mortality; Z growth and mortality). However the mathematical implementations differ in many places and the candidate adds several common ecological mechanisms absent from TRUTH. Uptake and growth are implemented via an explicit Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term combined with an explicit light limitation (with self-shading and background attenuation) and a tunable blend between multiplicative and Liebig minimum limitation. Grazing is a Hill/Holling-type functional response with an optional Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference denominator and assimilation efficiency; remineralization comes from explicit P and Z loss pools and an explicit yield (y_PN) converts P_growth into N_uptake. Mixing of nutrients is the same linear entrainment form as TRUTH. Several TRUTH terms can be recovered by special parameter settings (e.g., h_exp=2 and c_BD=0 approximates TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing), but overall the model is an ALTERNATE formulation in most canonical components and includes multiple extra ecological components (light/shading, temperature Q10 factors, BD interference, blended limitation, quadratic mortality, stoichiometric yield/remin fractions).",
