Assessment summary and rationale for changes:

1) Model-data fit
- Quantitative evaluation is pending: no residuals file or observed data are included in this chat, so I cannot compute or summarize fit diagnostics. Please provide the residuals to refine this assessment (e.g., systematic bias during low-light periods, bloom peaks, or post-bloom decay).
- Structural behavior: The model is a standard NPZ with nutrient and light limitation, temperature scalings (Q10), self-shading, Beddington–DeAngelis grazing, and vertical mixing. It is numerically stable via non-negativity smoothing and a lognormal observation model.

2) Alignment with project context
- The model directly targets mixed-layer dynamics of N, P, Z and includes essential drivers (light, temperature, mixing, grazing). This matches the project’s stated scope.
- Initial conditions are taken from t0 only, avoiding data leakage.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Resource colimitation: Growth is limited by a product of two nutrient terms (Monod × logistic threshold) and light (multiplicative). This can “double penalize” growth when both light and nutrients are moderately limiting, and may underpredict bloom initiation or over-suppress shoulder seasons. Many mixed-layer studies use a Liebig-type constraint (minimum of resources) or a smooth variant.
- Assimilation efficiency (e_Z) is constant; in reality it can vary with prey quality (nutrient status) or temperature. This is a candidate for future refinement.
- No detrital or DOM pool; all losses largely remineralize back to N. This is acceptable for a compact model but could miss export pathways; adding a new state would be a larger change than requested.
- Temperature affects growth and grazing but not mortalities; this is likely acceptable at current scope.

Chosen improvement: Smooth Liebig-type colimitation
- Ecological rationale: In the mixed layer, the most limiting resource (light or nutrients) typically constrains growth. Multiplicative limitation can over-penalize when both are moderate. A smooth Liebig minimum avoids non-differentiability and captures shifts between light- and nutrient-limited regimes, improving realism for bloom onset and quiescence without adding a new state.
- Mathematical form:
  - fN = fN_sat × fN_thr, with fN_sat = N / (K_N + N) and fN_thr logistic threshold as in the current model.
  - fI as in the current model.
  - L_min = smooth_min(fN, fI) = 0.5[(fN + fI) − sqrt((fN − fI)^2 + δ)], δ ≪ 1.
  - Blended limitation: L_eff = w_Liebig × (fN × fI) + (1 − w_Liebig) × L_min, where w_Liebig ∈ [0, 1] lets data choose between pure product (w=1), pure Liebig (w=0), or a mix.
  - P_growth = mu_max × θ_mu × L_eff × P.
- Benefits: Retains existing parameterization and identifiability while allowing the data to determine the appropriate colimitation structure, potentially reducing systematic bias during transitions between light and nutrient limitation.

Parameter updates
- Added w_Liebig (dimensionless, [0,1], default 0.5). Ecological justification: tunes how strictly the minimum resource controls growth vs. partial colimitation. Boundaries reflect the convex combination of two canonical forms.
- Corrected metadata for K_g: source indicates “updated from literature”; marked updated_from_literature=true and recorded updated_fields_from_literature.

Implementation notes
- Added smooth_min helper in model.cpp.
- Replaced the multiplicative limitation term in P_growth by the blended L_eff (no use of current-step observations; only previous-step predictions).
- Added soft bound penalty for w_Liebig in [0,1].
- No changes to the observation model or other processes.

Next steps (optional, pending residuals)
- If residuals show persistent bias at low prey, consider temperature dependence of mortality or variable e_Z tied to prey nutrient status.
- If residuals show misfit in high-light periods, consider (a) weak photoinhibition or (b) refining k_Ibg seasonality if data are available.

Please share the residuals file to verify whether this structural change improves fit and to guide further refinements.
