  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ mass flows (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth \u2192 recycling and mixing) but using more mechanistic/extended functional forms than the TRUTH script. Nutrient uptake is realized via a Michaelis\u2011Menten style saturation used inside P_growth (not the exact TRUTH algebra), recycling is explicit as fractions of different loss terms including unassimilated grazing, and mixing of nutrients is structurally identical to TRUTH. Phytoplankton growth is limited by both nutrient and light in a blended multiplicative/Liebig style with additional temperature scaling; grazing is a Hill/Holling style with Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference and an assimilation efficiency for Z growth. Several additional processes are present (temperature Q10 scaling, explicit light attenuation and Liebig blend, smooth nutrient gating, yield parameter separating uptake from growth, BD interference, quadratic mortality terms) that are not in the TRUTH NPZ.",
