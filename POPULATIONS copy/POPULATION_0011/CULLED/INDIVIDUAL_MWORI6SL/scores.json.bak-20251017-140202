  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ model that contains the canonical uptake, recycling and mixing fluxes and the standard P and Z dynamics (growth, grazing, mortality). Many formulations differ from the TRUTH algebra (different functional forms and extra processes): uptake and growth are implemented as Monod (N/(K+N)) multiplied by a separate saturating light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert + I/(K_I+I)), grazing is a general Holling-type with flexible exponent h, and mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms. The candidate also introduces explicit seasonality and a temperature (Q10) modifier, a separate yield parameter linking growth and nutrient uptake, and an explicit zooplankton excretion term. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles in TRUTH but uses alternate (and in some cases richer) functional forms.",
