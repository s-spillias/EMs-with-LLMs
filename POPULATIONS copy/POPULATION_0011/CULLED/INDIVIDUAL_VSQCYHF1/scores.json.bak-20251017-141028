  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure and covers most canonical ecological processes but with different functional choices and several additional mechanistic modifiers. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as a product of saturating nutrient-limitation and additional gating terms (explicit light limitation, a smooth nutrient-threshold, temperature scaling and a yield). Grazing is implemented as a generalized Holling-type saturating function (P^h/(K^h+P^h)) and maps directly onto the TRUTH Holling-III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) when h=2. Recycling and mixing are present but parameterized as fractional remineralization and a deep-pool mixing term. The candidate also adds extra processes not in the TRUTH model: Q10 temperature scaling, an explicit irradiance/light limitation with self-shading, a smooth nutrient-threshold gating, stoichiometric yield between uptake and P-growth, and explicit quadratic mortality terms for P and Z. Overall the candidate aligns closely with canonical families from the literature (Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, saturating light functions, Holling grazing, linear+quadratic mortality) while extending the TRUTH formulation with extra ecological detail and numerical safeguards.",
