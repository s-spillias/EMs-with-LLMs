  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the standard NPZ roles (uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, mixing) but using slightly different functional forms and with added environmental forcing. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times P, with an explicit seasonal light limiter and Q10 temperature multiplier (these forcings are not in the TRUTH model). Grazing is a Hill/Holling-type formulation (generalized exponent h) rather than the fixed P^2/(mu^2+P^2) used in TRUTH. Zooplankton mortality includes both linear and an extra quadratic term. The candidate matches the ecological roles in TRUTH, often via alternate standard formulations (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Hill-type grazing, linear mortality), but it does not include phytoplankton physical mixing/loss as a separate term and adds explicit temperature and seasonal light processes.",
