  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ scheme that includes the canonical processes (uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) but expressed with a richer set of ecological formulations and environmental forcings than the TRUTH Python NPZ. Key similarities: nutrient uptake is Monod-type with explicit light limitation feeding phytoplankton growth; grazing is Holling-type and drives both P loss and Z growth via an assimilation term; recycling returns unassimilated grazing and mortality to nutrients; nutrient mixing is a linear relaxation. Key differences / extensions: explicit seasonal light and Q10 temperature modifiers, a variable (nutrient-dependent) assimilation efficiency, explicit excretion term for Z, and both linear+quadratic mortality for P and Z. One canonical item from TRUTH \u2014 a direct phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss term \u2014 is not present in the candidate (P mixing absent).",
