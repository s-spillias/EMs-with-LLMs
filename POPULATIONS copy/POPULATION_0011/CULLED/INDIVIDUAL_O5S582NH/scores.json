  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements a full NPZ structure with all core flows (uptake \u2192 P growth, grazing \u2192 Z growth, recycling to N, and a mixing-driven N exchange). Many processes appear in the candidate as familiar functional families from the TRUTH model (e.g., saturating nutrient uptake, Holling-type grazing, linear mortality). However the candidate uses different realizations for several processes (explicit Q10 temperature scalings, an explicit irradiance function with exponential self-shading and a saturating light limiter, a smooth nutrient-threshold gating, yield-based conversion from P growth to N uptake, and explicit quadratic mortality terms). Some TRUTH terms are represented exactly in form (mixing for N; the Holling-type P-dependent grazing can be matched exactly by setting h_exp=2), while other terms are implemented using alternative, but ecologically equivalent, formulations (e.g., Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation and separate light limitation instead of TRUTH's single combined a/(b + c*P) factor). Note also modelling/numerical extras (soft penalties, smooth positivity, Euler stepping) are present but are not ecological processes.",
