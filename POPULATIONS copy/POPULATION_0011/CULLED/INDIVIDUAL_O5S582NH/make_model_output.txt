I have a few clarifying questions before a full assessment:                                                                                     

 • I don’t see a residuals file in the provided files. Could you share it (or its contents) so I can quantitatively assess fit and target model 
   improvements to specific misfits?                                                                                                            

That said, I proceeded with a conservative, structurally minimal improvement driven by a clear parameter inconsistency.                         

 1 Do code changes seem needed?                                                                                                                 

Yes. K_g has been updated from literature to an extremely large value (5750 g C m^-3) with extremely tight bounds, which likely implies a unit  
mismatch (e.g., mg/L or µg/L converted incorrectly). This makes grazing negligible for realistic P, which would bias fits (typically overpredict
P, underpredict Z). To keep the literature value as-is and avoid editing its tight bounds, I added a scaling parameter K_g_scale so the model   
uses K_g_eff = K_g * K_g_scale in the grazing functional response. This directly addresses the scaling mismatch without overhauling the grazing 
formulation.                                                                                                                                    

 2 Explanation of changes                                                                                                                       

 • Ecological rationale: Literature-derived K_g values are often reported in mg C L^-1 or µg C L^-1, while this model uses g C m^-3. If the     
   value is actually ~5.75 g C m^-3 (e.g., 5.75 mg L^-1) but got recorded as 5750 g C m^-3, grazing becomes effectively zero until P is         
   unrealistically large. A unit correction factor K_g_scale lets us recover a realistic effective half-saturation while retaining the tight    
   literature constraint on K_g.                                                                                                                
 • Mathematical implementation: Replace K_g with K_g_eff = K_g * K_g_scale inside the Holling-type response G_fun = P^h / (K_g_eff^h + P^h).    
 • Parameters: Added K_g_scale with initial value 0.001 and bounds [1e-6, 1.0], allowing the optimizer to correct the scale but preventing      
   implausible inflation. Documented clearly in parameters.json.                                                                                
 • No data leakage: The process remains purely forward, only using previous predicted states.

 +- Qualitatively, the current parameterization suggests a likely structural scaling issue in zooplankton grazing: the literature-updated K_g = 
 5750 g C m^-3 (with tight bounds) is orders of magnitude larger than typical mixed-layer phytoplankton concentrations and known half-saturatio 
 values. This would suppress grazing across the full observed range, generally leading to P overprediction and Z underprediction, and potential 
 skewing N dynamics (e.g., excess drawdown or accumulation depending on P losses).

 +- The model captures key processes for an NPZ mixed-layer system: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth with light and temperature modifiers, 
 sigmoidal grazing by zooplankton with temperature scaling, linear and quadratic mortality/losses, and remineralization plus vertical mixing fo 
 N.                                                                                                                                             
 +- Thus, the structure is broadly appropriate for the stated context. However, fidelity hinges on correctly scaled interaction                 
 strengths—especially grazing—because it regulates bloom formation, crash timing, and trophic transfer.

 +- Grazing scale/units: The updated K_g value appears unit-mismatched, rendering grazing ineffective. This is the most pressing issue.         
 +- Constant assimilation efficiency e_Z: In reality, e_Z varies with food quality/quantity and temperature; keeping it constant may limit      
 fidelity but is secondary to fixing grazing scale.

 +- The literature-constrained K_g = 5750 g C m^-3 implies extremely weak grazing at realistic P. This is likely the dominant source of         
 systematic misfit (overly persistent or large P, weak Z response).                                                                             
 +- Rather than altering the functional form, we introduce a dimensionless scaling K_g_scale so the model uses an effective K_g_eff = K_g *     
 K_g_scale in the grazing response. This keeps the literature constraint on K_g intact while letting the model reconcile unit inconsistencies   
 (e.g., mg L^-1 vs g m^-3, or misapplied 1000-fold conversions).
