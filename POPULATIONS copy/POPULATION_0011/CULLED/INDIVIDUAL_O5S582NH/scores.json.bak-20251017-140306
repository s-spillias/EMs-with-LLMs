  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with the same high-level compartments (N, P, Z) and includes the canonical ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortalities, zooplankton growth and mortality). However, the algebraic forms differ from the TRUTH in important ways: uptake and phytoplankton growth are computed via an explicit P_growth term that multiplies a Michaelis-Menten N-term by additional modifiers (light limitation, a smooth nutrient threshold, and Q10 temperature scaling) rather than the single a/(b + c P) factor used in TRUTH. Grazing is implemented as a generalized Holling-type functional response (P^h / (K_g^h + P^h)) with an assimilation efficiency, rather than the specific quadratic-in-P over (mu^2 + P^2) form in TRUTH. The candidate also adds several extra ecological/representational components not present in TRUTH (light & self-shading, Q10 temperature modifiers, smooth nutrient-threshold gating, explicit yield/stoichiometry converting P_growth to N_uptake, unit-scaling for grazing K_g, and explicit quadratic mortality terms). Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but uses alternate functional forms and additional ecological modifiers.",
