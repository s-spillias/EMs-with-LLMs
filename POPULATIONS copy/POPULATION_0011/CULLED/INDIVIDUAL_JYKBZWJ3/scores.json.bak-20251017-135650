  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ model that contains all core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing, mortality; Z growth and mortality). Many formulations match standard canonical families from the literature (Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation, Holling-type grazing, linear+quadratic mortality) rather than being algebraically identical to the provided TRUTH code. The candidate also includes several process extensions not present in the TRUTH NPZ: seasonal light forcing, a Q10 temperature multiplier applied to rates, explicit quadratic mortality terms for P and Z, and an explicit zooplankton excretion term (ex_z). The candidate uses discrete Euler stepping and smooth positivity/penalty machinery (implementation details rather than ecological processes).",
