  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (growth, grazing, mortality, remineralization, and mixing) but with different mechanistic choices and extra environmental modifiers. Phytoplankton growth is implemented as multiplicative Monod nutrient limitation combined with an explicit saturating light limitation and a temperature (Q10) multiplier. Grazing is implemented as a generalized Holling/Hill functional response (parameter h) and is used consistently in both P-loss and Z-growth fluxes. Nutrient mixing (relaxation to an external concentration) and recycling from grazing and mortality are present, but the candidate also includes extra processes absent in the TRUTH model (seasonal light forcing, temperature/Q10 modifier, explicit metabolic excretion term, and quadratic density-dependent mortality terms). There is one noteworthy mismatch: the candidate computes a zooplankton metabolic excretion term (Z_excr) but does not add it to the N_remin term (so excretion is removed from Z but not routed back to nutrients). Overall the candidate matches many canonical roles but uses alternate functional forms for uptake/light and adds extra environmental forcings and loss processes.",
