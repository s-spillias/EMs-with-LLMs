  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing, mortality; Z growth and mortality) but using more mechanistic/expanded formulations than the TRUTH model. Uptake is written as a Hill/Monod nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation and temperature Q10, with a stoichiometric yield linking P_growth to N_uptake. Grazing is Holling\u2011type with a Beddington\u2011DeAngelis interference term and a variable assimilation efficiency; P and Z have both linear and quadratic mortality terms. Mixing of nutrients matches the TRUTH mixing form exactly (linear entrainment), but explicit physical loss of P via mixing is missing. Overall many components are present but implemented as alternates or extended versions of the TRUTH terms (light limitation, Q10, BD interference, variable assimilation, yield, quadratic mortality are additions).",

Relevant lines: 'Type P_growth = mu_max * theta_mu * fN * fI * Pp;' and 'Type N_uptake  = P_growth / (y_PN + eps);'. This differs from TRUTH's (N/(e+N))*(...) * P but is a Monod/Hill nutrient-limited growth coupled to a yield parameter."
