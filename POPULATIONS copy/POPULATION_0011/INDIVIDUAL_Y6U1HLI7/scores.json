  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ mass-balance model with all three state equations and includes the core ecological roles found in the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing losses, non-grazing mortality; zooplankton growth and mortality). Many components are implemented with different, more general/modern functional forms (Hill/Monod nutrient limitation; explicit multiplicative light limitation with photoinhibition and self-shading; Holling/Hill grazing with Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference; explicit yield and variable assimilation efficiency; temperature Q10 modifiers). Nutrient mixing is present and matches the TRUTH structure. However, the candidate omits explicit mixing/entrainment terms for P and Z (they are present for N only), and some TRUTH-specific functional forms (the exact algebra of the TRUTH grazing and recycling terms) are replaced by alternate formulations.",

Type fN = Nh / (Kh + Nh + eps); ... Type P_growth = mu_max * theta_mu * fN * fI * Pp; ... Type N_uptake  = P_growth / (y_PN + eps);\". This is a Monod/Hill uptake formulation and an explicit yield, not the TRUTH form N/(e+N)*(a/(b+c*P))*P, so it matches the alternate family (Michaelis\u2013Menten/Hill growth) rather than TRUTH exactly."
