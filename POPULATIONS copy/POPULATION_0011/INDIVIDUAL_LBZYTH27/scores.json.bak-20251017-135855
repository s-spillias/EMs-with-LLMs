  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZD-style model that preserves the canonical roles from the TRUTH NPZ (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing, phytoplankton growth and losses, zooplankton growth and mortality) but does so with more mechanistic/extended formulations. Nutrient uptake is Monod/Michaelis-Menten style and multiplied by an explicit light limitation (self-shading) and a smooth nutrient-threshold gate. Recycling is routed through an explicit detrital/DOM pool (D) with remineralization and sinking, rather than direct instantaneous return-to-N terms as in TRUTH. Grazing is a Holling-type saturating response generalized with exponent h_exp and a Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference denominator; assimilation efficiency is dynamic (depends on nutrient limitation). There is an explicit temperature/Q10 scaling of rates. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles in TRUTH but generally as ALTERNATE formulations (except the mixing term which matches TRUTH directly and the phytoplankton mixing term which is missing).",
