  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ system with the canonical processes (uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing, mortality) but using different functional forms and added mechanistic modifiers. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) term feeding a phytoplankton growth rate that is multiplicatively limited by an explicit light function and a smooth nutrient gate. Grazing is a generalized Holling-type with Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference and a flexible exponent; zooplankton growth is grazing \u00d7 assimilation (with nutrient-dependent e_Z). Mixing is present for nutrients (toward a deep pool) and matches the TRUTH form. Phytoplankton mixing/physical loss is not explicitly present. Several extra ecological mechanisms (temperature Q10, self-shading light, nutrient gate, variable assimilation, predator interference, quadratic mortalities, stoichiometric yield linking uptake to growth) are included that are not in the TRUTH NPZ.",
