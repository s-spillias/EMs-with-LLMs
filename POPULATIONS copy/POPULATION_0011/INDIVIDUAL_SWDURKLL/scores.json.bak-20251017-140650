  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ model with all three state variables and most canonical processes (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing, mortality; Z growth and mortality). However the functional forms differ in several places: nutrient uptake is a Monod-type term tied to phytoplankton growth via an explicit yield, light limitation is an explicit saturating function with self-shading and a smooth threshold gate (rather than the single combined a/(b+c*P) factor in TRUTH), grazing is a Holling-type generalized response with a Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference term and flexible exponent, and assimilation efficiency is variable (depends on nutrient status). The candidate also adds temperature (Q10) scalings, explicit conversion yield (y_PN), and quadratic mortality terms. Overall the candidate matches the TRUTH model conceptually but uses alternate formulations for many components (so mostly ALTERNATE scores), with one missing term (P mixing) compared to TRUTH.",
