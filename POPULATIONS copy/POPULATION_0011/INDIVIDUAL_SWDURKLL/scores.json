  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ-like dynamics that captures the canonical ecological roles from the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth and mortality). However, the functional forms differ in many places: the candidate uses standard Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake and an explicit light limitation with self-shading, a Holling-like grazing with an exponent and Beddington\u2013DeAngelis predator interference, explicit yield and remineralization fractions, temperature (Q10) scalings of rates, and variable assimilation efficiency dependent on nutrient status. Some TRUTH terms are represented by close alternates (so most components are present as ALTERNATE implementations). Two components present in TRUTH (explicit phytoplankton mixing term and zooplankton mixing/entrainment) are not implemented in the candidate as separate process terms.",
