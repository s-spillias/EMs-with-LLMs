  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical NPZ structure (N uptake by P, grazing by Z, recycling to N, and zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing) but uses different functional forms in several places compared with the TRUTH Python model. Specifically: nutrient uptake is a standard Michaelis\u2013Menten V_max * N/(K_n+N) times P (TRUTH used an N-term times an additional P-dependent light/self-shading factor), grazing is Holling Type II (TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Hill-type response), zooplankton mortality is quadratic in Z (TRUTH uses linear q*Z), and recycling is represented by (1-beta)*grazing plus explicit P and Z mortality terms rather than the TRUTH's combination of lambda/alpha/beta and q/gamma terms. The candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and lacks an explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment term. The candidate also contains a statistical observation/error model (lognormal errors) and numerical stabilization (stability_const and positivity enforcement) which are implementation/statistical features, not ecological processes.",
