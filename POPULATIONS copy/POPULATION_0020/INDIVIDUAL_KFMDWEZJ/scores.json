Key differences: nutrient uptake is classic Michaelis\u2013Menten (no explicit light-dependence like the TRUTH a/(b + c*P) term), grazing is Holling Type II rather than the TRUTH Type-III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)), zooplankton mortality is quadratic (m_z * Z^2) rather than the TRUTH linear q*Z, and the candidate lacks the mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N) (and P mixing). The candidate also includes standard modeling engineering features (positivity enforcement, parameter penalties, lognormal observation error) which are not ecological processes in the TRUTH model.",
