**Model Assessment:**
The current model implements a standard Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) structure. It effectively captures the fundamental trophic interactions as described in the project context, using Michaelis-Menten kinetics for nutrient uptake and a Holling Type II functional response for grazing. This provides a solid baseline for simulating simple plankton dynamics.

However, the model simplifies mortality for both phytoplankton and zooplankton as linear processes (i.e., a constant per-capita death rate). The linear zooplankton mortality term (`m_z * Z`) is a particular point of oversimplification. It implies that the death rate of zooplankton is independent of their own population density, which neglects key ecological processes like predation by higher trophic levels (e.g., fish), cannibalism, or increased disease transmission at higher densities. This can lead to unrealistic population dynamics, such as unbounded oscillations or population explosions, as there is no density-dependent mechanism to regulate the zooplankton population.

**Proposed Improvement:**
I will replace the linear zooplankton mortality term with a quadratic mortality term (`m_z * Z^2`).

**Ecological Justification:**
This modification introduces a density-dependent loss for the zooplankton population. The ecological rationale is to represent a "closure" term, where zooplankton are preyed upon by an unmodeled higher trophic level. The rate of predation is assumed to increase with the square of the zooplankton density, reflecting that predators are more successful when prey is abundant.

This change has several benefits:
1.  **Increased Realism:** It more accurately reflects the dynamics of a food web where zooplankton are not the top predators.
2.  **Model Stability:** The quadratic term acts as a stabilizing feedback mechanism, preventing the zooplankton population from growing unchecked. This often leads to more stable and realistic model behavior, damping large-scale oscillations.
3.  **Implicit Trophic Level:** It implicitly accounts for the effects of a higher trophic level without the complexity of explicitly modeling it.

The mortality term `m_z * Z^2` will be included as a loss in the zooplankton equation (`dZ/dt`) and as a recycled nutrient source in the nutrient equation (`dN/dt`). The parameter `m_z` is re-purposed to represent this quadratic rate.
