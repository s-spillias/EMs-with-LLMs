  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but uses simpler functional forms than the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as classic Michaelis-Menten nutrient-limited growth (no explicit light limitation), grazing is a Holling type II functional response (instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form), and recycling is represented by the unassimilated fraction of grazing plus linear mortality terms. The candidate omits the explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH and also omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing term; zooplankton mixing is absent in both. Many model-fitting/solver constructs (stability constant, positivity enforcement, parameter penalties, Euler integration, lognormal observation model) are present but are not new ecological processes.",
