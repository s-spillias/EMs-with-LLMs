  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with different functional choices than the TRUTH Python model. It uses classic Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake and a Holling Type II grazing formulation, linear (first-order) mortality for P and Z, and nutrient recycling via the unassimilated fraction of grazing plus direct recycling of mortalities. It does NOT include the TRUTH model's P-dependent light limitation term a/(b + c*P), the TRUTH grazing form proportional to P^2/(mu^2 + P^2), nor an explicit mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N) or (s+k)*P. The candidate therefore matches many ecological roles but via alternate, simpler mathematical forms; it also omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment and TRUTH's specific saturating (P^2) grazing / light-limitation interactions.",
