  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling-II style grazing, linear mortalities, and immediate remineralization of unassimilated grazing and mortality. Many ecological roles in the TRUTH model are present, but some terms differ: the TRUTH model uses a two-factor phytoplankton growth term (N/(e+N) multiplied by a/(b+cP)), a P-dependent modifier in uptake, a saturating grazing with P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form, and an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term k*(N0-N). The candidate uses simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation for uptake, a Holling-II P/(K_P+P) grazing, and omits an explicit mixing/entrainment term. Overall the candidate matches ecological roles but uses alternate (simpler) functional forms for uptake and grazing and lacks the mixing term.",
