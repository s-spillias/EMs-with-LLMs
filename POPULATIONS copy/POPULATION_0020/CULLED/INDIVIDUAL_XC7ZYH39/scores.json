  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a classic NPZ structure (N uptake by P, grazing by Z, recycling and mortalities) but uses simpler/alternative functional forms compared with the TRUTH model. Uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten term (no explicit light/self-shading limitation), grazing is Holling Type II (TRUTH uses a Type-III P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form), recycling is handled as (1-beta)*grazing plus direct mortality-to-nutrient terms, and there is no environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients or phytoplankton. Zooplankton growth and mortality are present in the usual assimilated-grazing minus linear mortality form. Overall, most ecological roles are present but some functional forms are alternate and the mixing term present in TRUTH is missing.",
