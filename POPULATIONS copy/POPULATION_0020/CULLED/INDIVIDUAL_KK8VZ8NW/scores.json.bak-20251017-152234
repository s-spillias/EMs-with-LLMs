  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with simpler functional forms than the TRUTH model. It uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (V_max * N/(K_n+N) * P) and a Holling Type II grazing (g_max * P/(K_p+P) * Z), linear (first-order) mortality for P and Z, and returns recycling to nutrients via (1-beta)*grazing plus mortality terms. It therefore matches many ecological roles but differs from the TRUTH reference in two important ways: (1) TRUTH uses a more complex phytoplankton growth term (product of an N-limited factor and an additional a/(b + c*P) term) and a Type-III / Hill-like predator response P^2/(mu^2+P^2); the candidate replaces those with Michaelis\u2013Menten and Holling II forms (alternate families). (2) The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and an explicit mixing loss for phytoplankton, both present in TRUTH. Implementation details (Euler integration, positivity enforcement, lognormal observation model, parameter penalties) are computational rather than additional ecological processes.",
