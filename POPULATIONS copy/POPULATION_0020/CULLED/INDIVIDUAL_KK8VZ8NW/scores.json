  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard three-compartment NPZ with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, a Holling Type II grazing functional response, linear mortality for P and Z, and recycling via an excretion fraction (1-beta) of grazing plus direct mortality recycling. It differs from the TRUTH NPZ in three main ways: (1) the candidate lacks any explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and lacks mixing/sinking loss for P and Z, (2) phytoplankton growth in TRUTH includes an additional P-dependent factor a/(b + c*P) (a light/attenuation-like term) which is not present in the candidate, and (3) TRUTH uses a different grazing functional form (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) and more complex recycling terms, whereas the candidate uses Holling II and a simple (1-beta) excretion + linear mortality recycling. The candidate also contains numerical/estimation features (Euler forward integration, positivity enforcement, parameter-penalties, lognormal observation errors) that are not ecological processes.",
