  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements a standard, canonical NPZ structure: Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, Holling type II grazing, assimilation (via beta) driving zooplankton growth, and linear mortality for P and Z. It therefore matches the ecological roles in the TRUTH model but uses simpler/alternative functional forms for several terms. Major differences: (1) no explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (TRUTH has k*(N0 - N)); (2) TRUTH uses more complex combined light/nutrient limitation and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing/transfer form, whereas the candidate uses single Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake and Holling-II grazing; (3) recycling is represented in the candidate as (1-beta)*grazing + linear mortalities, instead of the TRUTH's two distinct recycling terms (beta*lambda_*P^2/(...) * Z and gamma*q*Z plus r*P). Numerical/estimation features (Euler integration, positivity enforcement, observation-model penalties) are present but are not ecological processes.",
