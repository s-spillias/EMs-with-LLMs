  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes: a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited phytoplankton uptake, Holling-type II grazing, recycling of unassimilated grazing plus mortality-derived recycling, and linear mortality for P and Z. However it omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in the TRUTH model and it lacks the TRUTH model's P-dependent self-shading / light-limitation factor (a/(b + c*P)) and the squared-P grazing formulation used in the TRUTH grazing. Parameter names (e.g. beta/alpha) are used differently between models. The candidate therefore matches many ecological roles but often as an alternate mathematical form (classic Michaelis\u2013Menten / Holling-II) rather than exact TRUTH structure.",
