  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard simplified NPZ: Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake (no explicit light limitation), Holling Type II grazing, linear non\u2011grazing mortalities for P and Z, and recycling via the unassimilated fraction of grazing plus mortality terms. It omits the TRUTH model's explicit mixing/entrainment term on N and P and the TRUTH grazing form (sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) / light\u2011limiting factor a/(b + c*P). The candidate uses discretized Euler integration and a lognormal observation model (statistical/estimation choices rather than ecological processes).",
