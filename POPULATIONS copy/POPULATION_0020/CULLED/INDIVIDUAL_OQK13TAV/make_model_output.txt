                                                                                              Assessment of the Current Model                                                                                               

 1 Model Fit & Structure: The current model is a standard Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) formulation. It uses Michaelis-Menten kinetics for nutrient uptake and a Holling Type II functional response for grazing,
   which are appropriate and widely used representations. However, a key simplification is the use of linear (density-independent) mortality for both phytoplankton (m_p * P) and zooplankton (m_z * Z). Linear mortality   
   can fail to capture self-regulating dynamics within a population, often leading to unrealistic boom-bust cycles or instability that does not match observed data. Specifically, zooplankton populations are often        
   controlled by predation from higher trophic levels (e.g., fish), which increases as the zooplankton population becomes more dense.                                                                                       
 2 Ecological Realism: The model captures the fundamental trophic transfers. However, the assumption of linear zooplankton mortality is a significant oversimplification. This term implicitly assumes that the per-capita  
   death rate of zooplankton is constant, regardless of their population size. In reality, factors like predation, disease, and cannibalism often lead to a death rate that increases with population density. Furthermore, 
   all mortality is instantly remineralized into the nutrient pool, which ignores the time lag associated with decomposition.                                                                                               
 3 Missing Processes: The most critical oversimplified process is the zooplankton mortality term. While other processes like temperature dependence or a detrital pool could be added, modifying the mortality term is a    
   foundational step to improve the model's stability and ecological realism.                                                                                                                                               

                                                                              Proposed Ecological Improvement: Quadratic Zooplankton Mortality                                                                              

I will introduce a quadratic mortality term for zooplankton. This is a common and effective method to represent density-dependent losses that are not explicitly modeled.                                                   

 • Change: The zooplankton mortality term will be changed from m_z * Z to m_z * Z^2.                                                                                                                                        
 • Ecological Justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                
    • Closure Term: This term acts as a "closure" for the model, implicitly representing predation from unmodeled higher trophic levels (like fish). As the zooplankton (Z) population grows, it can support a larger       
      predator population, leading to a disproportionately higher mortality rate.                                                                                                                                           
    • Intra-specific Competition: At high densities, competition for resources (other than phytoplankton), cannibalism, and the spread of diseases can increase, leading to a higher per-capita mortality rate.             
    • Model Stability: This modification introduces a stabilizing negative feedback loop. As the zooplankton population increases, its mortality rate increases faster, preventing uncontrolled population explosions and   
      creating more realistic, stable population dynamics.                                                                                                                                                                  

This change requires updating the zooplankton mortality term in both the dZ/dt and dN/dt (remineralization) equations in model.cpp, as well as updating the description, units, and value of the m_z parameter in           
parameters.json.

 +The current model is a standard NPZ formulation with Michaelis-Menten uptake and Holling Type II grazing. While a good starting point, it oversimplifies mortality by using a linear, density-independent rate (m_z * Z)  
 for zooplankton. This is ecologically unrealistic, as zooplankton populations are often regulated by density-dependent factors such as increased predation from higher trophic levels (e.g., fish), cannibalism, or diseas 
 transmission at higher population densities. This simplification can lead to model instability and poor fits to real-world data, particularly by failing to dampen predator-prey oscillations.
