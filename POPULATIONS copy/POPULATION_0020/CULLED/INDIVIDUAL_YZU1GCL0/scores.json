  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake driving P growth, grazing driving Z growth with assimilation, and linear mortality recycling to N). However it uses simpler, common functional forms compared to TRUTH: single Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (no explicit light limitation), Holling Type II grazing, and linear mortality. It omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH for N and the separate mixing term included with phytoplankton losses in TRUTH. Implementation details (Euler forward integration, positivity enforcement, parameter penalties, and a lognormal observation model) are coding/numerical/statistical choices rather than new ecological processes.",
