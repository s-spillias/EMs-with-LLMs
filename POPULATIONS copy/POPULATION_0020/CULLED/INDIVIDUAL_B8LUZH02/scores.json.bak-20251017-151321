  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard 3-box NPZ with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazer functional response, assimilation-based zooplankton growth, and linear mortality terms. Where it differs from the TRUTH model is (1) uptake and grazing functional forms (candidate: simple Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake and Holling type II grazing vs TRUTH: Monod-like N/(e+N) times a light/photoadaptation factor a/(b + c P) and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing), and (2) the absence of an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton. Recycling is present in the candidate via (1-beta)*grazing and mortality terms feeding back to N (an alternate but common formulation). No additional ecological state variables or novel processes beyond these standard formulations are introduced.",
