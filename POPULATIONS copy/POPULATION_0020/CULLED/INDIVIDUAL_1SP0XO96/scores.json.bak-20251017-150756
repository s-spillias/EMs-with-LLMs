  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth, grazing -> zooplankton + recycling, non-grazing mortality) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH model for several terms. Uptake is implemented as classic Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation (N/(K+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) times an additional light-dependent factor a/(b + c P). Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_p+P)*Z) instead of TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z. Recycling is represented by (1-beta)*grazing plus mortality returns; the candidate uses quadratic zooplankton mortality (m_z Z^2) whereas TRUTH uses linear zooplankton mortality (q Z) and an extra fraction term. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for N (k*(N0-N)) that exists in TRUTH. Implementation-level extras include an Euler time-stepping integrator, positivity enforcement and a lognormal observation model (these are modelling/estimation features, not new ecological processes).",
