MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) formulation. It captures the basic interactions: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing of phytoplankton by zooplankton, and recycling of nutrients from mortality and inefficient grazing.

While it addresses the core project context, a key simplification is the use of linear mortality for zooplankton (m_z * Z). This implies a constant per-capita death rate, which is ecologically unrealistic. In marine ecosystems, higher zooplankton densities typically lead to increased predation pressure from higher trophic levels (e.g., fish) and can increase susceptibility to disease. This density-dependent mortality is a crucial factor for population regulation.

PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
Introduce quadratic zooplankton mortality.

REASONING:
I will change the zooplankton mortality term from a linear function (m_z * Z) to a quadratic one (m_z * Z^2).

1.  Ecological Realism: This modification provides a more realistic representation of density-dependent mortality processes. It models the effect of predation by unmodeled higher trophic levels, which often respond to increases in their food source (zooplankton).

2.  Model Stability: Simple NPZ models with linear mortality are prone to large, unstable oscillations or extinctions. A quadratic mortality term acts as a stabilizing mechanism by increasing losses as the zooplankton population grows, which prevents them from completely decimating the phytoplankton population. This leads to more stable and realistic predator-prey cycles.

3.  Implementation Simplicity: This change is a meaningful ecological enhancement that requires modifying only one parameter's definition and its application in the model equations, without adding new state variables or excessive complexity. The parameter 'm_z' will be re-interpreted as a quadratic mortality coefficient, with its units and value adjusted accordingly.
