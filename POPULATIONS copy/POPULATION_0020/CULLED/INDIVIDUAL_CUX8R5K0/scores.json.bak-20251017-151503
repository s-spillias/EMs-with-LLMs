  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, linear mortality, recycling back to nutrients) but uses simpler/alternative functional forms compared to the TRUTH Python model. Specifically: uptake is classic Michaelis\u2013Menten (no explicit light limitation term present), grazing is Holling type II (P/(K+P)) rather than the TRUTH Hill/P^2 form, mortalities are linear (matching TRUTH), recycling is represented by unassimilated grazing + instantaneous remineralization from mortality (an alternate parameterization), and the candidate omits the TRUTH environmental mixing/entrainment and explicit sinking terms. The candidate also contains non-ecological model machinery (forward Euler integration, observation likelihood, parameter soft-penalties) that are not present in the TRUTH dynamics.",

TRUTH: uptake is \"(N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P\" which includes an extra light/attenuation factor a/(b + c*P).

TRUTH uses recycling terms such as \"(beta * lambda_ * P**2 / (mu**2 + P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z + r * P\".

TRUTH growth uses the combined nutrient and light-limitation: \"(N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P\".
