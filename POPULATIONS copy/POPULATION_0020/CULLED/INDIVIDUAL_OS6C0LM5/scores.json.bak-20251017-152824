  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) but uses simpler/alternate functional forms than the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth (no explicit light/P-dependent denominator present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_p+P)) rather than the TRUTH quadratic/saturating form (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). Recycling is represented by excretion as (1-beta)*grazing plus direct mortality recycling (m_p*P and m_z*Z). The candidate omits the environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N)) present in TRUTH. Numerical choices (Euler integration, positivity enforcement) and an observation/lognormal error model appear, but these are numerical/statistical, not new ecological processes.",
