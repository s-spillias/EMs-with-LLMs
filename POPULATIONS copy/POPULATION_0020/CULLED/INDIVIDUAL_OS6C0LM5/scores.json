  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N, P, Z) with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling-type grazing, linear mortalities and recycling from unassimilated grazing and mortalities. It differs from the TRUTH model in several mechanistic details: the candidate uses a simple Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake (no explicit light limitation term), a Holling type II grazing (P/(K_p+P)) rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form, and it omits environmental mixing/entrainment of nutrients/biomass present in TRUTH. Assimilation/recycling and linear mortality are present but implemented in alternate (but ecologically standard) ways. Numerical/observation-model features (Euler integration, lognormal observation likelihood, positivity enforcement) are present in the candidate but are not ecological processes.",
