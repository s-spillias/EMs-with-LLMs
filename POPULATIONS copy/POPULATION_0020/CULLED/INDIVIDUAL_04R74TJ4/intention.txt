Model Assessment:
The current NPZ model provides a solid foundation for the project context, using standard Michaelis-Menten and Holling Type II kinetics for uptake and grazing. However, the mortality terms for both phytoplankton and zooplankton are represented as simple linear functions (`m_p * P` and `m_z * Z`). This assumes a constant per-capita mortality rate, which is a significant oversimplification of complex ecological processes. This linear formulation can lead to poor model fits, especially at high population densities where processes like disease, viral lysis (for phytoplankton), and predation pressure (for zooplankton) become more intense.

Proposed Improvement:
I will introduce quadratic mortality terms for both phytoplankton and zooplankton. The linear terms will be replaced with `m_p_quad * P^2` and `m_z_quad * Z^2`.

Ecological Rationale:
This change introduces density-dependent mortality, a key feedback mechanism in many ecosystems.
- For phytoplankton, a quadratic term can represent self-shading or, more commonly, an increased rate of viral lysis as high host density facilitates pathogen transmission.
- For zooplankton, this term represents the functional response of an un-modeled higher predator. As zooplankton become more abundant, they provide a more reliable food source, and predation pressure increases more than linearly. This creates a stabilizing effect, preventing uncontrolled zooplankton blooms and subsequent crashes.

Justification:
This modification adds minimal complexity (two parameters are adjusted, no new state variables) while introducing a crucial ecological process. It directly addresses a key simplification in the original model and is expected to improve the model's ability to capture realistic population dynamics, particularly the regulation of population peaks.
