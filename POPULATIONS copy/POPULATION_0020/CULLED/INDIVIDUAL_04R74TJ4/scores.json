  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (uptake \u2192 P growth, grazing \u2192 Z growth, mortality / recycling \u2192 N) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth use a standard Michaelis\u2013Menten form (alternate to TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b+cP) structure). Grazing is Holling Type II (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Type\u2011III style term). The candidate implements recycling via (1-beta)*grazing and quadratic mortality terms returning to N rather than the TRUTH linear remineralization and multiple Z\u2192N terms. The candidate omits explicit mixing/entrainment terms for all state variables that appear in TRUTH (e.g., k*(N0 - N), (s+k)*P, q*Z). No genuinely new ecological processes (extra pools or temperature dependence, detritus, DOM, etc.) are introduced \u2014 only alternative functional forms for canonical processes.",
