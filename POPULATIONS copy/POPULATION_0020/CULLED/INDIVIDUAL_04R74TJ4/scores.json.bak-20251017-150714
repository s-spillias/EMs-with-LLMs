  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological processes (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, recycling from grazing and mortalities, and zooplankton growth via assimilation) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH model. Specifically, the candidate uses a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake (no light/photoinhibition term), a Holling type II grazing (P/(K_p+P)) rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (a type III/sigmoidal form), and replaces TRUTH's linear mortality and mixing terms with quadratic density-dependent mortality terms for P and Z. The candidate also omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but with alternate standard functional forms from the literature.",

TRUTH: \"(N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P\" includes Michaelis-type N/(e+N) but also an explicit light/ P-dependent term (a/(b + c*P)).

TRUTH uses \"r * P + (beta * lambda_ * P**2 / (mu**2 + P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z\" (linear recycling from P mortality and Z mortality and a grazing-related term).
