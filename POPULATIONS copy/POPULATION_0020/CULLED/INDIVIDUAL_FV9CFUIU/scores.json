  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ structure (N, P, Z with uptake, grazing, mortality, and recycling) but uses different functional forms in key places and omits environmental mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH. Uptake and phytoplankton growth use a standard Michaelis\u2013Menten form (candidate) versus a composite nutrient+P-dependent form in TRUTH. Grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate vs a Type\u2011III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) form in TRUTH. Recycling/excretion and mortality are represented but partitioned differently. The candidate also lacks the explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment (k*(N0-N)) and the phytoplankton mixing term present in TRUTH. Observation/error model and numerical choices (Euler integration, positivity enforcement, lognormal errors) are implementation details, not extra ecological processes.",
