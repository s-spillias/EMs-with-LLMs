  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a simpler, classical NPZ structure compared with the TRUTH model. It uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by P (V_max * N/(K_n+N) * P) and a Holling type II grazing (g_max * P/(K_p+P) * Z) with an explicit assimilation efficiency (beta). Mortality terms are linear and returned to nutrients. Differences vs TRUTH: TRUTH uses a more complex light limitation term (a/(b + c*P)) and a sigmoidal (Type III) grazing P^2/(mu^2+P^2) with multiple explicit recycling terms and an explicit mixing/entrainment k*(N0 - N). The candidate omits mixing/entrainment and replaces TRUTH\u2019s Type III grazing and light-limitation factor with simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten and Holling-II forms. Overall the candidate matches canonical roles but uses alternate, simpler functional forms and omits the mixing component.",
