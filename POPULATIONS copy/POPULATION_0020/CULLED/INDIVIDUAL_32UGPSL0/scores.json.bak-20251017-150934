  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth + mortalities and recycling) but uses simpler functional forms than the TRUTH model. Uptake is classic Michaelis\u2013Menten (N/(K+N)) multiplied by P rather than the TRUTH's compound nutrient \u00d7 light-limitation term (N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P)). Grazing is Holling type II (P/(Kp+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. The candidate includes linear non-grazing mortalities and returns those mortalities to nutrients, but it omits any explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N) and k*P) present in TRUTH. The candidate also contains modeling machinery not in TRUTH (observation likelihood, parameter penalties, positivity enforcement), but no additional ecological state or process (detritus, temperature dependence, explicit exudation) is introduced.",
