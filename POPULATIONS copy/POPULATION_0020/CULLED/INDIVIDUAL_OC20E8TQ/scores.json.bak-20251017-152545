  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ structure (N, P, Z states; uptake-driven phytoplankton growth; grazing-driven zooplankton growth; recycling back to nutrients) but uses different functional forms in several places and omits explicit mixing/entrainment. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as simple Michaelis-Menten (Monod) uptake (alternate to TRUTH's two-factor N * light/size term). Grazing is a Holling Type II functional response (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Zooplankton growth is assimilation of grazing (present), but zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic density-dependent term not present in TRUTH. The candidate therefore matches the ecological roles but differs in specific functional forms and omits the mixing term present in TRUTH.",
