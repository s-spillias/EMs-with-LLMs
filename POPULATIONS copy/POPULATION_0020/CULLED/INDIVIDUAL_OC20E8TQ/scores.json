  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with important formulation differences from the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth in the candidate is a single Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited term (no explicit light limitation term present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Hill-type / Type III) in TRUTH. Both models include recycling from grazing and linear phytoplankton mortality, but the candidate expresses recycling as (1-beta)*grazing and also returns zooplankton and phytoplankton mortalities to nutrients; TRUTH uses different partitioning parameters (beta, gamma) and explicit mixing in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations. The candidate adds an extra ecological closure: quadratic zooplankton mortality (m_z2 * Z^2) not present in TRUTH. Several physical mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH (nutrient mixing k*(N0-N) and mixing loss in P) are absent in the candidate. Numerical/details: the candidate uses explicit Euler stepping and a lognormal observation model (not ecological processes).",
