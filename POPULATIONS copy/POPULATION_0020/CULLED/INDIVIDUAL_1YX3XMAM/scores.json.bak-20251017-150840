  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as classic Michaelis\u2013Menten (V_max * N/(K_n+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c*P)) * P form. Grazing is Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_p+P) * Z) instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) dependence. Recycling is represented by (1-beta)*grazing plus explicit mortality recycling (m_p*P, m_z*Z, m_z2*Z^2). The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt and dP/dt that the TRUTH includes (k*(N0 - N) and (s+k)*P). The candidate introduces an extra explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality term (m_z2 * Z^2) that is not present in the TRUTH formulation. Overall, the candidate matches canonical NPZ roles but via alternate, commonly used functional forms and with one extra mortality process.",
