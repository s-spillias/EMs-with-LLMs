Model Assessment:
The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) formulation, which serves as a good baseline for simulating plankton dynamics. It includes Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and a Holling Type II functional response for zooplankton grazing.

However, a significant simplification is the use of linear, density-independent mortality for both phytoplankton and zooplankton. For zooplankton in particular, this is ecologically unrealistic and can lead to model instability. Without a density-dependent control, the zooplankton population can exhibit unbounded growth or extreme oscillations that do not reflect natural systems, where factors like predation and disease increase with population density.

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a quadratic mortality term for the zooplankton population (Z).

Reasoning for Improvement:
I am adding a quadratic mortality term (`m_z2 * Z^2`) to the zooplankton differential equation. This term introduces a density-dependent mortality mechanism, which is a crucial feature for population regulation in most ecosystems.

Ecological Justification:
1.  **Predation**: This term implicitly represents predation from a higher, unmodeled trophic level (e.g., planktivorous fish). As zooplankton become more abundant, they are a more attractive and available food source, leading to a disproportionately higher predation rate.
2.  **Stability**: From a mathematical standpoint, this term acts as a stabilizing negative feedback. It helps to dampen population oscillations and prevents the zooplankton population from growing to unrealistic levels, leading to a more robust and realistic model behavior.
3.  **Other Density-Dependent Factors**: It can also be interpreted as a proxy for other processes that intensify at high densities, such as increased susceptibility to disease or stress from crowding.

This change requires adding one new parameter, `m_z2`, representing the rate of this quadratic mortality. The dead zooplankton biomass from this new process will be remineralized back into the nutrient pool, maintaining the model's mass balance.
