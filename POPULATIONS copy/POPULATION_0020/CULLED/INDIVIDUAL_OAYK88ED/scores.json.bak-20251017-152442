  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same basic trophic structure as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton \u2192 zooplankton) but uses simpler/alternate functional forms and omits an explicit environmental mixing/dilution term. Uptake is classic Michaelis\u2013Menten on N (multiplied by P) and grazing is Holling Type II; recycling is via unassimilated grazing plus linear mortality rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2)-type predation/remineralization terms and a separate mixing/entrainment flux. Several components are one-to-one matches in form (linear mortalities, assimilated growth), while others are alternate formulations relative to TRUTH (uptake, grazing, recycling). No truly new ecological state or process (detritus pool, temperature dependence, explicit mixing) is introduced in the candidate code.",
