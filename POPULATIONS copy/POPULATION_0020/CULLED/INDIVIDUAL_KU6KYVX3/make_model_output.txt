 1 Model Structure & Project Context: The current model is a standard Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) model. It correctly implements the fundamental interactions described in the project context: nutrient uptake
   by phytoplankton, grazing of phytoplankton by zooplankton, and recycling of nutrients through mortality and excretion. The use of Michaelis-Menten kinetics for uptake and a Holling Type II functional response for     
   grazing are standard and appropriate for a simple plankton model.                                                                                                                                                        
 2 Oversimplified Processes: The primary simplification is the representation of mortality. Both phytoplankton (m_p) and zooplankton (m_z) mortality are modeled as linear processes (m*StateVariable). For zooplankton,    
   this implies a constant per-capita death rate, regardless of population density. This is ecologically unrealistic. In marine ecosystems, zooplankton mortality is often density-dependent due to factors like predation  
   from higher trophic levels (e.g., fish), increased disease transmission, or cannibalism at high densities.                                                                                                               

                                                                              Proposed Ecological Improvement: Quadratic Zooplankton Mortality                                                                              

I will introduce a more realistic representation of zooplankton mortality by changing the term from linear to quadratic.                                                                                                    

 • Current: Mortality = m_z * Z                                                                                                                                                                                             
 • Proposed: Mortality = m_z * Z^2                                                                                                                                                                                          

Reasoning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

This change introduces a density-dependent self-regulation mechanism for the zooplankton population. A quadratic term implies that the per-capita mortality rate (m_z * Z) increases as the zooplankton population (Z)      
grows. This is a common and effective way to implicitly model predation by higher trophic levels that are not explicitly included in the model. It prevents unrealistic, explosive growth of the zooplankton population and 
can lead to more stable, realistic population dynamics (e.g., damped oscillations), which is central to understanding the "dynamical behaviour" of the system.                                                              

This change requires modifications to the model equations in model.cpp and an update to the m_z parameter's metadata and value in parameters.json to reflect its new role and units.

 +The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) formulation, which serves as a solid foundation for the project's goal of simulating plankton dynamics. It uses well-established kinetic         
 expressions for nutrient uptake and grazing. However, a key simplification is the use of a linear mortality term (`m_z * Z`) for zooplankton. This assumes a constant per-capita death rate, which does not account for    
 density-dependent processes that are crucial for population regulation in real ecosystems.

 +1.  **Ecological Realism:** Quadratic mortality represents density-dependent loss. This is a common way to implicitly model processes like predation from un-modeled higher trophic levels (e.g., fish, which are more    
 attracted to denser patches of zooplankton), increased cannibalism, or faster spread of diseases in crowded populations.                                                                                                   
 +2.  **Population Regulation:** This change introduces a crucial negative feedback loop that stabilizes the zooplankton population. As zooplankton density increases, their per-capita mortality rate also increases,      
 preventing unchecked population growth and subsequent catastrophic collapse of the phytoplankton population. This leads to more realistic and stable system dynamics.                                                      
 +3.  **Structural Impact:** This modification directly addresses the "dynamical behaviour" aspect of the project context. The change from linear to quadratic mortality fundamentally alters the stability properties of t 
 predator-prey (Z-P) interaction.                                                                                                                                                                                           
 +4.  **Implementation:** The change is mathematically straightforward but has profound ecological implications. It requires updating the differential equations for both zooplankton (`dZ/dt`) and nutrient recycling      
 (`dN/dt`), as well as adjusting the `m_z` parameter's units, description, and initial value to be consistent with its new role in the model.
