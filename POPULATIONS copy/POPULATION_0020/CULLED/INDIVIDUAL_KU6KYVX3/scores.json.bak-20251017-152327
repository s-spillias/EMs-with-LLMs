  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the standard NPZ roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing transfers, phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton growth and mortality) but using different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth use a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten form (no explicit light limitation), grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_p+P)), zooplankton growth is assimilation of that grazing, and zooplankton mortality is quadratic (Z^2). The candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations and uses a different recycling structure (unassimilated fraction of grazing (1-beta)*grazing and explicit mortality recycling m_z*Z^2) rather than the TRUTH's lambda_/mu P^2/(mu^2+P^2) and gamma*q*Z terms. Numerically the candidate simulates with an Euler stepper and includes an observation (lognormal) likelihood and positivity enforcement (implementation details, not ecological processes).",
