**Model Assessment:**
The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) formulation, which serves as a solid foundation for the project's goal of simulating plankton dynamics. It uses well-established kinetic expressions for nutrient uptake and grazing. However, a key simplification is the use of a linear mortality term (`m_z * Z`) for zooplankton. This assumes a constant per-capita death rate, which does not account for density-dependent processes that are crucial for population regulation in real ecosystems.

**Chosen Ecological Improvement: Introduce Quadratic Zooplankton Mortality**
I will modify the zooplankton mortality term from a linear function (`m_z * Z`) to a quadratic function (`m_z * Z^2`).

**Justification:**
1.  **Ecological Realism:** Quadratic mortality represents density-dependent loss. This is a common way to implicitly model processes like predation from un-modeled higher trophic levels (e.g., fish, which are more attracted to denser patches of zooplankton), increased cannibalism, or faster spread of diseases in crowded populations.
2.  **Population Regulation:** This change introduces a crucial negative feedback loop that stabilizes the zooplankton population. As zooplankton density increases, their per-capita mortality rate also increases, preventing unchecked population growth and subsequent catastrophic collapse of the phytoplankton population. This leads to more realistic and stable system dynamics.
3.  **Structural Impact:** This modification directly addresses the "dynamical behaviour" aspect of the project context. The change from linear to quadratic mortality fundamentally alters the stability properties of the predator-prey (Z-P) interaction.
4.  **Implementation:** The change is mathematically straightforward but has profound ecological implications. It requires updating the differential equations for both zooplankton (`dZ/dt`) and nutrient recycling (`dN/dt`), as well as adjusting the `m_z` parameter's units, description, and initial value to be consistent with its new role in the model.
