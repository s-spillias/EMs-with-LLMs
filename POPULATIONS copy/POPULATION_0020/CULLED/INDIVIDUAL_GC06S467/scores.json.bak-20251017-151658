  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ model with the same general NPZ structure (N uptake \u2192 P growth \u2192 Z growth via grazing) but uses simpler/alternate functional forms compared with the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are modeled with a Michaelis\u2013Menten dependence on N (no explicit light/self-shading factor present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate vs. a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form in TRUTH. Nutrient recycling is present in the candidate as unassimilated grazing + linear (and quadratic) mortalities returning to N, but the explicit mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N)) in the TRUTH model is missing. The candidate also adds a quadratic zooplankton mortality term (m_z_q * Z^2) that is not in TRUTH. Numerical implementation (Euler stepping, positivity enforcement) and observation model choices (lognormal errors) are present but are not ecological processes.",
