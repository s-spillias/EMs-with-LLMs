  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard, simpler NPZ structure: Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (single-factor), Holling-type II grazing, assimilation-based zooplankton growth, and linear mortalities. It lacks the TRUTH model's more complex P-dependent light/size term and the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (sigmoidal/Holling-III-like) grazing/growth formulation, and it omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton. The candidate also includes non-ecological implementation choices (Euler time stepping, positivity clamps, observation/lognormal error and optimizer penalties) but these are not extra ecological processes.",
