  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the expected NPZ processes (nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling/excretion, mortality, and zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing) but uses different mathematical formulations than the TRUTH Python model. Specifically, phytoplankton growth/uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by P (no explicit light-limitation term of the TRUTH model), grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a Type-III-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) in TRUTH, mortalities are simple linear terms, and nutrient mixing/entrainment (k*(N0-N) in TRUTH) is missing. The candidate also explicitly partitions grazing into assimilated (beta*grazing) and unassimilated (1-beta)*grazing returned to nutrients (common alternate formulation). Numerical integration, observation model, and positivity enforcement are implementation details but not extra ecological processes.",

This differs from TRUTH's multiplicative N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c * P)) * P because the candidate lacks the TRUTH light-like term a/(b+c*P) and uses classic V_max * N/(K_n+N) form."

      "explanation": "Candidate returns unassimilated grazing to nutrients and adds mortality recycling: nutrient derivative uses \"dNdt = -uptake + (1.0 - beta) * grazing + m_p * P_prev + m_z * Z_prev;\". TRUTH uses more complex recycling terms (e.g. \"(beta * lambda_ * P**2 / (mu**2 + P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z\"), so the candidate's form is an alternate but ecologically equivalent recycling representation."
