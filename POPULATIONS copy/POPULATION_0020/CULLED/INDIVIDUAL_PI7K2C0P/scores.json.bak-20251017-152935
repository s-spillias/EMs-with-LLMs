  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but is a simplified variant of the TRUTH model. It uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation for uptake, a Holling Type II grazing, linear non-grazing mortalities, and recycling of a fraction of grazing and of mortalities back to nutrients. Differences vs TRUTH: (1) TRUTH uses a compound phytoplankton growth term combining N/(e+N) with a/(b + c*P) (a self-shading / light-limitation factor producing a P-dependent denominator and a P^2-type grazing, i.e., Type III-like functional response). The candidate omits the a/(b+cP) term (no explicit light/self-shading) and uses grazing = g_max * P/(K_p + P) (Holling II) instead of TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) (sigmoidal). (2) The candidate does not include an environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N)) present in TRUTH. Numerically, the candidate simulates forward with an Euler update and enforces positivity; TRUTH used an ODE solver (RK45).",
