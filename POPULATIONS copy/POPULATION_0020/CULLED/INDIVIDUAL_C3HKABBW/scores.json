  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ scaffold (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth, grazing -> zooplankton growth, linear mortalities and recycling) but with simpler, standard functional forms than the TRUTH model. Specifically: uptake is a Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limited term (no explicit light limitation factor), grazing is Holling Type II (TRUTH used a Type\u2011III P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form), recycling is via (1-beta)*grazing plus mortality returns rather than the TRUTH's separate lambda_/gamma terms, and the candidate omits the environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH. The candidate also contains modelling infrastructure (likelihood, positivity enforcement, Euler time stepping) that are non-ecological implementation details.",
