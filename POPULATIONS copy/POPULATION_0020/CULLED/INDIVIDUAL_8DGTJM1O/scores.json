  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard 3-box NPZ with Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, Holling Type II grazing, linear mortality, and immediate remineralization of dead biomass and unassimilated grazing. It differs from the TRUTH model mainly in (1) the phytoplankton growth/grazing functional forms \u2014 TRUTH uses a P-dependent term a/(b + c P) and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (sigmoidal/Holling-III-like) grazing, while the candidate uses simpler Michaelis-Menten N-limitation and Holling-II grazing (P/(K_P+P)), (2) the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations, and (3) numerical/estimation infrastructure (forward Euler solver, observation likelihood, soft parameter penalties) is present in the candidate but is non-ecological. Overall, the candidate matches the TRUTH on linear mortality and assimilated grazing structure (presence of an assimilation efficiency), but uses alternate canonical formulations for uptake and grazing and lacks mixing terms present in TRUTH.",
