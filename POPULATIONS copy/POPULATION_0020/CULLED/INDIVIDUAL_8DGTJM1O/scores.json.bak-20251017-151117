  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a classic NPZ structure but uses simpler functional forms than the TRUTH model. The candidate uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited phytoplankton uptake and a Holling type-II grazing with an assimilation efficiency; both are common alternates to the TRUTH model's more complex light/self-shading factor and a sigmoidal (Type-III) grazing. The candidate also omits an explicit mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH. Observation error modeling and optimizer penalties are present in the candidate but are modeling machinery, not additional ecological processes.",

The candidate uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten (N/(K+N)) limiter multiplied by P (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P). TRUTH includes an additional P-dependent light/self-shading factor (a/(b + c*P)), so the candidate is an alternate (Michaelis-Menten) rather than an exact match."

This represents (1 - assimilation) of grazing returning to nutrients plus instantaneous remineralization of dead P and Z. TRUTH uses terms '(beta * lambda_ * P**2/(mu**2+P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z' and an r*P term; the candidate's form is a standard alternate (assimilation efficiency and direct mortality remineralization) rather than identical to TRUTH's functional choices (different sign convention/parameter naming and a Type-III grazing form)."
