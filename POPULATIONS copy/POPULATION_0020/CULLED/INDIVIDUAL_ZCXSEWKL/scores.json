  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure: Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited phytoplankton uptake, Holling Type II grazing, linear (density-independent) mortalities, and recycling of the unassimilated fraction of grazing back to nutrients. These are common alternate formulations relative to the TRUTH model. The candidate omits several TRUTH-specific features: the TRUTH nutrient uptake multiplies a nutrient term by an additional light/shading factor a/(b + c*P) (i.e., a P-dependent modifier), TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2)-style grazing term and several distinct recycling terms (including gamma*q*Z and a lambda_ term) and explicit mixing/entrainment in N and P (k*(N0 - N) and (s+k)*P). The candidate also contains non-ecological modeling machinery (observation error model, positivity constraints, Euler solver). Overall: ecologically plausible but simpler/alternate in key functional forms and missing explicit mixing terms present in TRUTH.",
