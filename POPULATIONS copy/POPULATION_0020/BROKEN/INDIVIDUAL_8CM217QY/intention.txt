This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton ecosystem based on the Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) framework. It describes the flow of a limiting nutrient (e.g., nitrogen, represented in units of carbon) through the lower trophic levels of the oceanic mixed layer.

The model consists of three state variables:
1. Nutrient (N): The dissolved inorganic nutrient pool available for primary production.
2. Phytoplankton (P): Microscopic marine algae that form the base of the food web. Their growth is dependent on nutrient availability.
3. Zooplankton (Z): Small animals that graze on phytoplankton.

Key ecological processes include:
- Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, modeled with Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
- Zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton, described by a Holling Type III functional response, which provides a refuge for phytoplankton at low densities.
- Mortality of both phytoplankton and zooplankton.
- Nutrient regeneration through the excretion of unassimilated food by zooplankton and the remineralization of dead organic matter.
- The system is open, with nutrient exchange with a deep-water reservoir simulated as a mixing process.

The model is structured as a set of coupled ordinary differential equations, providing a framework to predict future ecosystem states based on initial conditions.
