This model simulates the dynamics of a three-component planktonic ecosystem in the oceanic mixed layer, consisting of Nutrients (N), Phytoplankton (P), and Zooplankton (Z).

The model follows the flow of a limiting nutrient (e.g., nitrogen, represented in units of carbon) through the ecosystem:
1.  **Nutrient Dynamics:** The nutrient pool is consumed by phytoplankton for growth. It is replenished through three main pathways: the remineralization of dead phytoplankton and zooplankton, and the excretion of unassimilated nutrients by zooplankton during grazing.
2.  **Phytoplankton Dynamics:** Phytoplankton are the primary producers. Their growth is co-limited by the availability of nutrients, following a Michaelis-Menten uptake curve. They are consumed by zooplankton (grazing) and experience natural mortality.
3.  **Zooplankton Dynamics:** Zooplankton are the primary consumers. Their growth is dependent on the consumption of phytoplankton, described by a Holling Type II functional response, which accounts for saturation at high phytoplankton densities. A fixed portion of the grazed phytoplankton is assimilated into zooplankton biomass, while the rest is excreted. Zooplankton are subject to a density-dependent (quadratic) mortality term, representing predation by higher trophic levels or increased mortality at high population densities.

The model is structured to capture these key feedback loops, such as the recycling of nutrients which sustains primary production, and the top-down control of phytoplankton by zooplankton.
