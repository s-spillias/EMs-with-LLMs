  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N uptake \u2192 P growth \u2192 Z grazing \u2192 Z growth + mortality) but uses simpler functional forms than the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a single Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake term (V_max * N/(K_n+N) * P) rather than the two-factor form in TRUTH that multiplies a nutrient term by an additional P-dependent factor a/(b + c P). Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (P/(K_p+P)), while TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Hill-type (sigmoidal) response. The candidate recycles unassimilated grazing via (1-beta)*grazing and includes linear mortality terms that return to nutrients, but it omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH for nutrients and the explicit phytoplankton mixing term. Zooplankton linear mortality matches TRUTH in form. Implementation/estimation details (Euler integration, positivity enforcement, lognormal observation model, parameter-penalty terms) are present in the candidate but are implementation/observation components rather than new ecological processes.",
