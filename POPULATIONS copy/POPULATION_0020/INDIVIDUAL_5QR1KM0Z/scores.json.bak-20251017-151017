  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, recycling of unassimilated grazing and mortalities, and linear zooplankton growth/mortality via assimilation efficiency. However the functional forms differ in several places from the TRUTH model: the candidate uses a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (V_max*N/(K_n+N)) and a Holling Type II grazing (g_max*P/(K_p+P)*Z) while the TRUTH uses a more complex product of a nutrient limitation N/(e+N) and a P-dependent denominator a/(b + c*P) for uptake and a Type-III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) grazing. The candidate also omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH. Other elements (linear non-grazing mortality for P and linear mortality for Z, assimilation-based Z growth, and recycling from mortalities and unassimilated grazing) are present though often with different parameterization or grouping. Numerical/observation extras (Euler integration, positivity enforcement, observation error model) are present but are not ecological processes.",

TRUTH used \"(N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P\" (a product of Michaelis-like N/(e+N) and a P-dependent denominator). The candidate lacks the TRUTH's P-dependent denominator (b + c*P) so it is an alternate Michaelis\u2013Menten formulation."
