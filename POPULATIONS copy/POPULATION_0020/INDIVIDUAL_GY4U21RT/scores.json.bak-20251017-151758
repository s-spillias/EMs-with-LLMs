  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements a standard mass\u2011balance NPZ with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, Holling Type II grazing, linear mortality and direct recycling of mortality and unassimilated grazing back to nutrients. Compared to the TRUTH model, the candidate omits the explicit mixing/entrainment terms and the TRUTH light/self\u2011shading limitation (the a/(b + c*P) factor) and uses a Holling II grazing (P/(K_p+P)) instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (a Type III / sigmoidal form). The candidate therefore matches the ecological roles but uses different (literature\u2011standard) functional forms for uptake and grazing and lacks the explicit mixing/entrainment processes present in TRUTH. Non\u2011ecological implementation details in the candidate (Euler integration, positivity enforcement, observation model and optimizer penalties) are present but are not counted as extra ecological components.",
