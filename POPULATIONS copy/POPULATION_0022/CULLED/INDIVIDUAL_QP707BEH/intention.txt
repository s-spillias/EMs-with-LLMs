This model simulates the episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities, specifically fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites species.

The model's core ecological function is the predator-prey interaction between COTS and corals, which generates characteristic boom-bust population cycles. COTS population growth is driven by the consumption of coral, modeled with a saturating Holling Type II functional response that accounts for selective predation on the two coral types. Population dynamics are also influenced by natural mortality and external larval immigration events, which can trigger outbreaks.

Coral dynamics are described by logistic growth, with the two types competing for limited space on the reef. Coral growth rates are modulated by sea-surface temperature, incorporating a thermal performance curve to capture the effects of environmental conditions.

The feedback loop is central to the model's behavior: a COTS outbreak, fueled by high coral availability, leads to a drastic reduction in coral cover. This depletion of their food source causes the COTS population to crash due to starvation. The subsequent period of low COTS density allows the coral communities to begin a slow recovery, eventually setting the stage for a future outbreak.
