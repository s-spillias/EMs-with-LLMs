This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on a coral reef, focusing on the episodic outbreaks that characterize their life history. The model aims to predict the abundance of adult COTS and the percentage cover of two key coral groups: fast-growing (e.g., Acropora) and slow-growing (e.g., Faviidae, Porites) corals.

Ecological Dynamics:
1. Coral Growth and Competition: Both fast- and slow-growing coral populations follow logistic growth, competing for limited space on the reef. The carrying capacity for each is reduced by the presence of the other.

2. COTS Predation: COTS are predators that consume both types of coral. This relationship is modeled using a Holling Type II functional response, which accounts for predator satiation at high coral densities. The model incorporates a feeding preference, with COTS preferentially consuming the more palatable fast-growing corals.

3. COTS Population Dynamics: The COTS population grows based on the energy it gains from consuming corals, with different assimilation efficiencies for each coral type. Its population is regulated by both a constant natural mortality rate and a density-dependent mortality term, which becomes significant at high population densities, contributing to the "bust" phase of an outbreak.

4. Outbreak Trigger: The model treats COTS larval immigration as an external forcing event. Pulses of immigration, as provided by the data, serve as the primary trigger for the "boom" phase of an outbreak, leading to a rapid increase in the COTS population.

The model structure captures the critical feedback loop: larval immigration triggers a COTS population boom, which leads to a decline in coral cover. The subsequent food scarcity, combined with density-dependent effects, causes the COTS population to crash, allowing the coral community to begin a slow recovery. This framework is designed to reproduce the characteristic boom-bust cycles observed in nature.
