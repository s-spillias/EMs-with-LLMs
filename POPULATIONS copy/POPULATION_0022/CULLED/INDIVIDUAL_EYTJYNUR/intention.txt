This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on a coral reef community, specifically distinguishing between fast-growing (e.g., Acropora) and slow-growing (e.g., Faviidae, Porites) corals. The model aims to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks.

Ecological dynamics are governed by a set of coupled differential equations:
1.  **Coral Growth:** Both fast and slow-growing coral populations follow logistic growth, limited by their respective carrying capacities. They compete for space, and their growth rates are modulated by sea-surface temperature (SST), with an optimal temperature for each coral type.
2.  **COTS Predation:** COTS prey on both coral types. This is modeled using a multi-species Holling Type II functional response, which accounts for predator saturation and prey switching based on coral availability and a preference parameter for fast-growing corals.
3.  **COTS Population:** The COTS population changes based on four processes:
    a.  **Growth:** COTS biomass increases through the assimilation of consumed coral.
    b.  **Mortality:** COTS experience both a constant natural mortality and density-dependent mortality, which increases at high population densities.
    c.  **Immigration:** Larval immigration, a key driver of outbreaks, is included as an external forcing variable based on time-series data.

The model is calibrated against time-series data for COTS abundance and the cover of both coral types, using a lognormal error distribution to account for the positive nature of population data. The objective is to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks and their cascading effects on the coral community structure.
