  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements all canonical NPZ processes (uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing, mortality, assimilation) but using different, more modular/parameterized formulations. Nutrient uptake is a Michaelis\u2013Menten style term embedded in a smooth co-limitation (nutrient \u00d7 light combined via a generalized mean) rather than the TRUTH's explicit N/(e+N) \u00d7 (a/(b + c P)) form. Grazing is a Holling/Hill functional response (flexible exponent h) analogous to the TRUTH type-III-like term. Phytoplankton mortality and mixing are linear and match the TRUTH structure. Zooplankton growth via assimilation matches TRUTH, but zooplankton mortality includes an added quadratic density-dependent term not present in TRUTH. The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) modifiers on rates and a separate continuous excretion term \u2014 these are modeling extensions absent from the TRUTH NPZ. Numerically the candidate uses forward Euler integration and a lognormal observation model (infrastructure differences).",
