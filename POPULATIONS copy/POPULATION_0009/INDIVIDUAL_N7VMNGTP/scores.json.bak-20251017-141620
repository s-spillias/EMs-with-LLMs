  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing by zooplankton, recycling to nutrients, and mixing) but uses different parameterizations in several places. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth follow a Michaelis\u2013Menten style N/(K+N) term combined with a smooth co-limitation (a smooth \u201cminimum\u201d of nutrient and light), rather than the TRUTH\u2019s specific N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) formulation. Grazing is a Holling/Hill-type functional response (general h exponent) similar in family to the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) term. Recycling and excretion are present but routed/parameterized differently. The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) scaling of rates, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and applies mixing/dilution to Z \u2014 processes not present in the TRUTH script. Overall the candidate matches the canonical ecological roles but with several alternate formulations and a few extra processes.",
