  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model that covers all canonical ecological roles (uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing, mortality, mixing; Z growth, mortality, mixing). Many terms are structurally equivalent to TRUTH (mixing for N and P; linear P mortality; linear P mixing; Monod-style nutrient limitation). Several components use alternate but standard formulations from the literature: nutrient uptake is Monod combined with an explicit light co-limitation (power-mean / smooth-min) rather than the TRUTH algebraic factor, grazing and zooplankton growth use a generalized Hill/Holling functional response (exponent h) rather than the specific P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form, and zooplankton mortality includes additional quadratic density-dependent loss. The candidate also introduces extra ecological processes not present in the TRUTH model (temperature/Q10 scaling of rates, explicit excretion and egestion routing to dissolved nutrients, quadratic Z mortality, and explicit dilution of Z). Overall the candidate is ecologically complete and uses reasonable alternate formulations; several extras increase realism (but deviate from the exact TRUTH algebra).",
