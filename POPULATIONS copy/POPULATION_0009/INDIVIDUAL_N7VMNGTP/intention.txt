Assessment and rationale for improvement

1) Model fit to data
- Residuals: A residuals file was referenced but not provided here. Please share it for a quantitative assessment.
- Qualitative expectations: In classic NPZ systems, models that do not recycle the unassimilated portion of grazing often exhibit:
  - Overly slow nutrient recovery following blooms
  - Excessive drawdown of nutrients relative to observed levels
  - Potentially mis-timed or overly large phytoplankton peaks
  These patterns arise because a sizable flux (1 - AE_Z)*grazing is removed from P but not returned to N.

2) Alignment with project context
- The current model captures key mixed-layer processes: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton constrained by nutrient and light, zooplankton grazing with a Hill functional response, temperature scaling (Q10), mortality and excretion, and mixed-layer exchange (D_mix, N_in).
- This is appropriate for simulating N, P, Z in a mixed layer. However, realistic internal nutrient recycling is crucial for mixed-layer bloom dynamics and subsequent nutrient rebound.

3) Missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Unassimilated ingestion pathway: The model currently lacks routing of the unassimilated fraction (1 - AE_Z) of grazing back to the dissolved nutrient pool, which is a well-documented fast recycling pathway (sloppy feeding and egestion followed by rapid microbial remineralization).
- Light dynamics: Light availability is constant (L_avail). Biomass-dependent self-shading could be considered in future iterations.
- Stoichiometry: Single-element C representation is assumed; flexible stoichiometry is not modeled.
- Detritus/DOM pools: No explicit detrital or DOM state; the chosen improvement below addresses fast recycling without adding a new state variable.
- Temperature effects: Most linear rates are scaled by Q10; quadratic mortality (gamma_Z) is not temperature-modified (often acceptable, but could be revisited if data support it).

4) Parameter review
- Q10 is updated from literature (value ~1.99, upper bound 2.17), consistent with typical marine plankton ranges. The current Q10 scaling of growth and most linear processes is appropriate.
- AE_Z = 0.6 is within canonical ranges. Without an unassimilated pathway, the missing flux (1 - AE_Z)*grazing does not reappear, which can bias dynamics.
- Other parameters are reasonable first estimates; no structural inconsistencies are forced by the literature updates at present.

Chosen single improvement: add fast recycling of unassimilated ingestion to dissolved nutrients
- Ecological justification: A fraction of ingestion is not assimilated and is released as DOM or egested particles that can be rapidly remineralized in the mixed layer. Representing this as an immediate return to dissolved nutrients captures a key indirect feedback and improves mass balance without a new state variable.
- Mathematical implementation:
  - Define egestN = f_egest_N * (1 - AE_Z) * grazing
  - Modify remineralization term to: remin_N = r_PN*mortP + r_ZN*mortZ + excrZ + egestN
  - State equations remain Euler-forward using only previous-step states.
- New parameter:
  - f_egest_N (0â€“1): fraction of unassimilated ingestion routed to dissolved nutrients. Initial estimate 0.7 (reflecting efficient fast recycling), bounds [0,1].
- Diagnostics:
  - Added egestN_pred to report the magnitude of the new flux for interpretability and to support residual analysis.

Anticipated effects on fit and dynamics
- Faster nutrient rebound during/after grazing events.
- Reduced phytoplankton peaks due to enhanced feedback from grazing to nutrient pool, potentially improving timing and amplitude.
- Improved mass balance closure between N losses to uptake and returns from mortality/excretion/egestion.

Next steps (pending residuals)
- Examine residual patterns for N during bloom decline: improvement should reduce positive N residuals during recovery phases.
- If phytoplankton peaks remain too high, consider adding biomass-dependent light limitation (self-shading) in a future iteration.
