  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ with the canonical uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing and mortality pathways. Many terms map directly to the TRUTH model (linear P mortality, grazing\u2192Z growth via assimilation, linear mixing of N, Hill-type grazing form), while other processes are implemented as common alternates from the literature (Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake combined with an explicit light limitation/self-shading and a smooth co-limitation operator, Q10 temperature modifiers). The candidate therefore mostly preserves the ecological roles in TRUTH but with extra realism/flexibility (temperature dependence, explicit excretion/egestion routing, quadratic Z mortality, zooplankton dilution) and slightly different functional choices for uptake/light limitation.",
