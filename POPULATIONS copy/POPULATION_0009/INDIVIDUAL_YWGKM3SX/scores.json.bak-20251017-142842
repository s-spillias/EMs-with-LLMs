  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ components but using richer, alternative formulations. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term combined with a smooth co-limitation (a smooth Liebig/min) for light rather than the exact multiplicative form in TRUTH. Grazing is a Hill/Holling-style functional response (general h) with an explicit assimilation efficiency; phytoplankton mortality and mixing are linear like TRUTH. Nutrient recycling and zooplankton mortality are present but routed/parameterized differently (explicit excretion, egestion, remineralization fractions and an added quadratic Z mortality). The candidate also adds temperature (Q10) modifiers and explicit egestion/excretion routing which are not in the TRUTH model.",
