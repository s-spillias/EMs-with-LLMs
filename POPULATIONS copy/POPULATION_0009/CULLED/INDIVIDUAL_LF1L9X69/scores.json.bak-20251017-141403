  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation, a Holling/Hill grazing function, explicit assimilation and remineralization, and a linear mixing term on nutrients. Where it departs from the TRUTH Python model is mainly in (1) how environmental/light limitation is represented (an explicit sinusoidal seasonal driver E combined with a logistic modifier fE and a smooth power-mean co-limitation with fN), and (2) inclusion of density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality. Many processes in the candidate match literature alternates (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Hill/Holling grazing, linear mortality) and several can be reduced to the TRUTH form by parameter choices (e.g., h_fr=2, g_max=lambda_).",

      "explanation": "Candidate uptake appears as gross primary production Gp = mu * P where mu = mu_max * f_lim and fN = Np / (k_N + Np). Code: \"Type fN = Np / (k_N + Np + eps);\" and \"Type mu = mu_max * f_lim; Type Gp = mu * Pp;\". This is Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limitation multiplied by an environmental modifier f_lim (smooth co-limitation), which differs in form from the TRUTH factor (N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c*P)) but is the same ecological role (N-limited growth) and matches common alternates."

This implements recycling from phytoplankton mortality, unassimilated ingestion and zooplankton mortality (same ecological sources as TRUTH) but as a single remineralization fraction rather than the multiple distinct terms in TRUTH (e.g. r*P, beta*lambda_*...*Z, gamma*q*Z)."
