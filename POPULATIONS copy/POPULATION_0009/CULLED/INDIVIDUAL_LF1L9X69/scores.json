  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure but with several stylistic and mechanistic differences vs the TRUTH Python model. Both models have nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth with assimilation, recycling of losses back to dissolved nutrient, and a mixing/relaxation term for nutrients. However the candidate: (a) represents nutrient limitation as an explicit Michaelis\u2013Menten fN combined with an explicit seasonal environmental driver (fE) via a smooth co\u2011limitation (generalized mean) rather than the particular multiplicative/light term used in TRUTH; (b) uses a Holling-style generalized functional response for grazing (pow(P,h)/(k_P^h + P^h)) rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form; (c) returns remineralization as a fraction of multiple loss terms (P_loss + Unass + Z_loss) rather than the TRUTH\u2019s specific predation/mortality recycling terms; and (d) includes quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality. Overall mechanistic roles are present and recognizable, but several components are alternates or extras relative to TRUTH.",
