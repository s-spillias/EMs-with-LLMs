  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the same overall NPZ logic (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and recycling/mixing) but with several structural differences. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Monod/ Michaelis\u2013Menten style term (N/(K_N+N)) multiplied by a seasonal/environmental modifier (f_env) rather than the TRUTH's self-shading term a/(b + c*P). Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type III functional response (generalized hill exponent) which is functionally equivalent to the TRUTH grazing when hill_exponent=2. Recycling in the candidate is implemented via explicit partitioning into an explicit detritus pool (D) with remineralization and sinking and a tunable immediate remineralization fraction, and assimilation efficiency beta is made nutrient-dependent (beta_eff). Zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) rather than the TRUTH linear loss. Physical mixing is represented for nutrients (k_mix*(N_deep-N)) matching TRUTH's mixing but there is no explicit mixing term for phytoplankton or zooplankton in the candidate. The candidate also uses forward Euler integration and contains additional modeling/practical terms (detritus pool, seasonal forcing, dynamic assimilation efficiency) not present in the TRUTH model.",
