  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles: Monod-style nutrient uptake driving phytoplankton growth, Holling-type grazing driving P\u2192Z transfer, recycling of losses back to N, and a physical mixing term for nutrients. It departs from the TRUTH model in three main ways: (1) it uses a separable time-varying environmental modifier (seasonal f_env) instead of the TRUTH's P-dependent light/self-shading term, (2) it introduces an explicit detritus pool with partitioning and sinking/remineralization, and (3) zooplankton assimilation is dynamic (nutrient-dependent beta_eff) and zooplankton mortality is quadratic rather than linear. The candidate therefore matches many canonical components (often as standard alternates) but omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking term present in TRUTH and uses forward Euler integration (numerical choice) rather than an ODE solver (implementation difference).",

This matches the common Michaelis-Menten uptake family but differs from TRUTH which multiplies Monod by a P-dependent light/self-shading factor (a/(b+c*P))."
