  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Monod nutrient uptake, a Holling-III grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, explicit recycling of unassimilated grazing + mortalities, and mixing of nutrients. Some terms are algebraically equivalent to the TRUTH (notably the Holling-III grazing and the nutrient mixing), others are implemented as common alternates (Monod uptake, seasonal environmental modifier for phytoplankton growth, quadratic zooplankton mortality). The candidate uses an explicit recycling fraction (remin_frac) applied to unassimilated ingestion and mortality rather than the TRUTH's individual recycling terms, and it omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing loss term present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate captures the canonical ecological roles but differs in the specific functional choices for light/seasonality and zooplankton mortality.",

Thus functional family is Michaelis-Menten but not exact TRUTH form."
