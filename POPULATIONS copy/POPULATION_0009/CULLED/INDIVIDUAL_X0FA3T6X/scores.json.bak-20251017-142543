  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ processes present in the TRUTH model but with several common alternate formulations and some additional ecological processes. Nutrient uptake is handled as a Michaelis\u2013Menten type N-limitation embedded in a multiplicative co-limitation (nutrient \u00d7 light) with a smooth generalized-mean (approximate Liebig) combining term; phytoplankton growth is mu*P (with co-limitation and temperature scaling). Grazing is a Hill/Holling-type functional response (P^h/(K_P^h + P^h)) multiplied by Z, and zooplankton growth uses an explicit assimilation efficiency (AE_Z). Mixing/dilution has the same algebraic form as the TRUTH model (D_mix*(N_in - N)). The candidate also explicitly includes rate temperature-scaling (Q10), an explicit excretion term, and a quadratic density-dependent zooplankton mortality \u2014 processes not present (or not explicit) in the TRUTH script. Overall: matches ecological roles for all canonical components; many are ALTERNATE formulations (Michaelis\u2013Menten, Hill/Holling, linear mortality) and a few are exact-form matches (mixing, linear P mortality).",
