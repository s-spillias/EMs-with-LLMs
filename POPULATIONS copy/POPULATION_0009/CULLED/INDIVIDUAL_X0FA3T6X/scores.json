  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (N uptake -> P growth -> Z grazing -> Z losses -> N recycling + mixing) but with a different mechanistic choice in several places and several added processes. Nutrient uptake/growth are implemented as a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient term combined with an explicit light limitation via a smooth co-limitation (generalized Liebig/smooth-min). Grazing is a Holling/Hill-type functional response (general h, so includes TRUTH's type-III as a special case). Recycling is more explicit: excretion, egestion-to-N routing and fractional remineralization of mortalities are all represented. The candidate also introduces temperature dependence (Q10) on biological rates, explicit quadratic zooplankton density-dependent mortality, and explicit dilution/mixing applied to Z (TRUTH did not include Z mixing). Numerically the candidate uses forward Euler stepping for the process model (discrete integration) whereas TRUTH is defined as continuous ODEs solved by an ODE solver.",
