  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements all canonical ecological roles from the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling to nutrients, mixing/dilution, phytoplankton growth, grazing loss, non\u2011grazing mortality, mixing losses, zooplankton growth via grazing with assimilation, and zooplankton mortality). However the mathematical formulations differ in several places: nutrient uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term co\u2011limited with light using a generalized mean (soft\u2011min) rather than the exact multiplicative form in TRUTH; grazing is a Hill/Holling form with an added Beddington\u2013DeAngelis predator\u2011interference denominator; zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic term and explicit excretion/egestion/remineralization routing; and the candidate adds ecological modifiers (temperature Q10, self\u2011shading Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation) not present in the TRUTH code. Many differences are legitimate alternate formulations documented in the literature rather than missing components.",
