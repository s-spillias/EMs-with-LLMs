  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with the canonical compartments (N, P, Z) and includes uptake, recycling, mixing, grazing, mortality and explicit observation error. Many ecological roles from the TRUTH model are present, but several are implemented with alternate, literature-standard formulations (e.g., Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake with explicit light co-limitation and a Hill/Holling grazing with flexible exponent). Some components match the TRUTH structure exactly (nutrient mixing, linear P mortality, P mixing). The candidate also adds realistic extra processes (temperature/Q10 scaling of rates, explicit self-shading light attenuation, quadratic Z mortality and explicit Z dilution) that are not in the TRUTH code.",
