  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling to nutrients, mixing/dilution, phytoplankton growth and losses (grazing, mortality, dilution), and zooplankton growth and mortality. Formally the candidate uses standard alternative functional forms: Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient uptake, an explicit light limitation via Beer\u2013Lambert self-shading combined with a smooth co-limitation (smooth-min) between N and light, a Hill/Holling grazing response (general h exponent), and temperature (Q10) scaling of rates. Many TRUTH terms map directly (mixing/dilution, linear P mortality, Holling/Hill grazing with biomass-multiplicative Z uptake and assimilation), but there are also extra ecological processes introduced (temperature/Q10 modifier, explicit zooplankton excretion term separated from mortality, and an added quadratic density-dependent zooplankton mortality).",
