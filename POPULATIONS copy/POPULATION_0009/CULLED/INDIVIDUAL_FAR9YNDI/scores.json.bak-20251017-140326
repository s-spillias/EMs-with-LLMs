  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with all three state equations and the canonical processes present. It uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation and an explicit light limitation combined via a smooth co-limitation (approximate Liebig smooth-min) to drive phytoplankton growth, a Hill/Holling-type grazing formulation for zooplankton ingestion, and explicit routing of mortality, excretion and egestion to dissolved nutrient pools. Compared with the TRUTH model, the candidate matches the same ecological roles but often uses alternate functional forms (e.g., smooth co-limitation and Hill grazing) or augments processes (temperature/Q10 scaling, quadratic Z mortality, explicit excretion). Mixing/dilution is implemented in the same linear form as TRUTH. Overall the candidate is ecologically consistent with the TRUTH NPZ but includes several purposeful extensions and alternate mathematical choices that are common in the literature.",
