Assessment and rationale

1) Fit to data
- The residuals file was not provided in this context, so a quantitative fit assessment (e.g., residual distributions, autocorrelation, seasonal bias) cannot be completed here. Typical diagnostics we would compute: log-scale RMSE/MAPE for N, P, Z; residual ACF/PACF; seasonal patterns (phase/bias relative to environmental forcing); and cross-correlations.
- In similar NPZ structures with only quadratic zooplankton mortality, common misfit patterns include: (a) overly persistent or exaggerated Z peaks, (b) delayed decay of Z following P declines, and (c) damped rebound of N that lags observations. If your residuals show overprediction of Z after bloom peaks or phase shifts in N/P seasonality, the change below specifically targets those issues.

2) Alignment with the project context
- The current model represents the classic mixed-layer NPZ system: Monod nutrient uptake for phytoplankton growth, Holling type III grazing, recycling, and a mixing term to a deep nutrient concentration. A seasonal environmental modifier for primary production is applied on a logit scale. This structure is appropriate for the stated project context.
- The observation model uses lognormal errors with a stabilizing floor, which is suitable for strictly positive concentrations.

3) Missing/oversimplified processes
- Single nutrient limitation (no explicit light co-limitation) is a simplification; acceptable for a minimal model but may under-represent spring bloom triggers.
- Constant zooplankton assimilation efficiency (β) does not reflect potential dependence on prey quality or temperature.
- No detrital/particulate pool; all losses not assimilated are routed directly to remineralized N, which accelerates feedbacks.
- Zooplankton mortality is purely quadratic in the baseline model. This omits maintenance respiration and external predation that often scale linearly with Z.

Chosen improvement: Add linear zooplankton mortality (mZ_linear)
Ecological reasoning
- Many NPZ models include both linear and quadratic zooplankton losses. The linear term represents maintenance respiration and external predation (e.g., fish, higher trophic levels) not proportional to Z² encounters. Including it improves realism and often corrects overly persistent Z peaks and phase lags in N rebound.
- This adds only one parameter and minimally increases complexity while providing a meaningful control on Z decay independent of Z magnitude.

Mathematical changes
- dZ/dt = β G(P,Z) − mZ_linear · Z − mZ_quadratic · Z²
- dN/dt gains an additional remineralization term from linear Z mortality:
  + remin_frac · mZ_linear · Z
- All prediction steps continue to use only previous-step state variables (no data leakage).

Parameterization
- New parameter: mZ_linear [d^-1]
  Initial value: 0.05; bounds [0.0, 1.0]. Literature commonly uses 0.01–0.2 d^-1 for mixed-layer zooplankton linear mortality/respiration; wider bounds allow data-driven estimation.
- No parameters are currently marked as updated_from_literature; if future literature updates indicate substantially different ranges (e.g., higher g_max or lower K_N), we may revisit the grazing functional form or nutrient half-saturation scaling.

Next steps for evaluation (pending residuals)
- Refit with mZ_linear and compare: (1) log-scale RMSE for Z, (2) post-peak Z residuals, and (3) phase of N rebound. Improvement in these would support the change.
- If residuals still show strong seasonal phase errors in P, consider co-limitation with a simple light proxy or refine the seasonal modifier; if Z variability remains excessive, consider adding a small linear P quadratic loss (aggregation/viral lysis) or a temperature dependence on g_max.
