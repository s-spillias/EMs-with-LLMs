  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the canonical processes: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing (Holling-type), recycling to nutrients, and mixing to a deep nutrient pool. Many functional roles match the TRUTH model but via different parameterizations: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) N-term multiplied by a time-varying seasonal modifier (inv_logit(sin(...))) rather than the TRUTH's P-dependent light term a/(b + c*P). Grazing is Holling-type (P^h/(K_G^h+P^h)) matching the Holling-III family in TRUTH. The candidate also adds explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality and an explicit seasonal forcing (sin + logistic transform) that are not in TRUTH. Mixing of nutrients is present and matches TRUTH, but an explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment term is missing in the candidate.",
