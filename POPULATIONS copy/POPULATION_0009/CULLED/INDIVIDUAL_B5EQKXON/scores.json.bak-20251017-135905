  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (N, P, Z state updates with uptake, grazing, mortality, and mixing) but uses different mechanistic formulations in several places. Nutrient uptake/growth are implemented as a Monod-type nutrient term combined with an explicit light co-limitation (smoothed power-mean / smooth-min) and a temperature (Q10) modifier \u2014 this differs from the TRUTH factor a/(b + c*P) but is a standard alternate (Monod \u00d7 light/co-lim). Grazing is a Hill/Holling-type functional response (generic h exponent) multiplied by Z and assimilation efficiency, matching the ecological role of TRUTH's saturating grazing but via a different algebraic form. Recycling and excretion are explicitly partitioned (mortality remineralization, excretion, and an explicit egestion-to-N parameter r_EG). Mixing is implemented in the same mathematical form as TRUTH (D_mix*(N_in - N)). Additional processes present in the candidate but not in TRUTH include an explicit temperature (Q10) modifier on rates, an explicit light availability/co-limitation formulation, quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality, and an explicit fast egestion-to-N remineralization parameter. Overall the model is ecologically consistent with NPZ paradigms but uses several alternate/extended formulations relative to the TRUTH model.",
