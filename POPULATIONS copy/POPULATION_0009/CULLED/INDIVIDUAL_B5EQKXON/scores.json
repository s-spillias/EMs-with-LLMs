  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements all canonical NPZ processes but often with different, more mechanistic or generalized functional forms than the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term co-limited with light via a smooth \u201csoft-min\u201d co-limit (not the same algebraic light factor in TRUTH). Grazing is a Hill/Holling family functional response (generalized exponent h) and zooplankton growth uses an explicit assimilation efficiency (AE_Z) analogous to TRUTH's alpha. Nutrient recycling is more mechanistic (explicit remineralization fractions, excretion, and an instantaneous egestion-to-N pathway). The candidate also adds explicit temperature dependence (Q10), explicit excretion/egestion pathways, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and applies mixed-layer exchange/dilution to Z (TRUTH only included k on N and P). Overall: all canonical roles are present, many as expected families (Michaelis\u2013Menten, Holling/Hill, linear mortality), but the candidate includes several extra processes and uses different algebraic co-limitation/grazing forms.",
