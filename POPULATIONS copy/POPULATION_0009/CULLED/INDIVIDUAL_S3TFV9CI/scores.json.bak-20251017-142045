  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (N uptake -> P growth, grazing -> Z growth, recycling and mixing) but uses different mechanistic choices in several places. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented by a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term combined with a light co-limitation (a smooth-Liebig style co_lim), rather than the exact functional form used in the TRUTH code. Grazing is implemented as a Hill/Holling-type functional response (generalized by exponent h). Recycling and mixing are present but routed and parameterized differently (explicit excretion, egestion, mortality components). The candidate also includes extra ecological processes not in the TRUTH model: explicit temperature/Q10 modifiers on rates, dynamic light with self-shading, and an additional quadratic zooplankton mortality term.",
