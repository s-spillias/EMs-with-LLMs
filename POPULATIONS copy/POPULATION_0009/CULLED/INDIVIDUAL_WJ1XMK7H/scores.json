  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (uptake-driven P growth, grazing, recycling, mortality, and mixing for nutrients) but several implementations differ in functional form from the TRUTH script. Nutrient uptake in the candidate is a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) form multiplied by an explicit seasonal (light/temperature) modifier; TRUTH uses N/(e+N) times a P-dependent light-like factor a/(b + c*P). Grazing is Holling type III in both models (TRUTH fixes exponent 2; candidate uses a tunable hill_exponent). Recycling in the candidate is routed through an explicit detritus pool with a partitioning parameter (remin_frac), whereas TRUTH includes direct recycling terms to N. The candidate omits an explicit physical mixing loss for phytoplankton and for zooplankton, and it uses forward Euler integration (numerical detail). Extra processes in the candidate include: an explicit detritus pool with remineralization and sinking, a seasonal environmental modifier, nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency (beta_eff), and an explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality term.",

TRUTH has explicit recycling terms added to dN (e.g. '(beta * lambda_ * P**2 / (mu**2 + P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z'), so the process exists but is implemented via an explicit detritus pool and partitioning rather than TRUTH's direct terms."
