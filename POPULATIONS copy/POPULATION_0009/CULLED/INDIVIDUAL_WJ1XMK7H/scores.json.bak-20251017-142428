  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the major ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Monod/ Michaelis\u2013Menten type), grazing with a Holling-type saturating functional response, and zooplankton growth proportional to assimilated grazing. Nutrient recycling and mixing are present but implemented differently: recycling is partitioned between immediate remineralization and an explicit detritus pool with remineralization and sinking; mixing is applied to the nutrient pool as k_mix*(N_deep - N) (matching TRUTH mixing form) but there is no explicit physical loss term applied to P as in TRUTH\u2019s (s + k)*P. Additional model structure (seasonal environmental modifier on growth, nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency, explicit detritus pool with sink/remineralization, quadratic zooplankton mortality) are extra processes absent from the TRUTH NPZ. Integration is done with forward Euler in the candidate (TRUTH used an ODE solver), which affects numerical equivalence but not the ecological-role matching below.",

TRUTH uses N/(e+N)*...*P (Monod-like) but multiplies a different P-dependent term (a/(b + c*P)), so structure is alternate but within the same Michaelis\u2013Menten family."

TRUTH has direct recycling terms like \"(beta * lambda_ * P**2 / (mu**2 + P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z + r * P\"; the candidate implements recycling with a different bookkeeping (partitioning into D and immediate remineralization), so it is a similar recycling role but not one of the enumerated alternates."
