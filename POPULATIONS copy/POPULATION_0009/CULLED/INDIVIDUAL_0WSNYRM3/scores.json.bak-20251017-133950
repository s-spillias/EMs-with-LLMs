  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZD-style dynamics that captures the main ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ: Monod-type nutrient uptake driving P growth, Holling-type grazing transferring C to Z, recycling of a fraction of losses back to N, and a physical mixing term for N. However the candidate uses a different mathematical implementation in several places: nutrient limitation is Monod (as in TRUTH) but the light/environmental limitation is an explicit seasonal inv_logit(sin(...)) modifier rather than the TRUTH a/(b + c*P) term; grazing is a Hill/Holling-III family matching TRUTH structurally; recycling is implemented via an explicit detritus pool plus an immediate remineralized fraction (repartitioning) rather than TRUTH's direct parameterized return terms. The candidate also adds several extra ecological components not present in the TRUTH model (detritus pool and dynamics, seasonal forcing, nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency, quadratic zooplankton mortality).",
