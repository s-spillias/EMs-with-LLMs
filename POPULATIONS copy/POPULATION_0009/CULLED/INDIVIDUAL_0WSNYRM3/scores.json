  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZD-style model that captures the core ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling to nutrients, grazing-mediated zooplankton growth and mortality, and mixing of nutrients. However the mathematical forms differ in places: uptake and phytoplankton growth use a classic Monod (Michaelis-Menten) times a seasonal environmental modifier (f_env) rather than the TRUTH's combined N-limited times a (b + c P) denominator; grazing is implemented as a Hill/Holling-III functional response and matches the TRUTH functional family; recycling is implemented via an explicit detritus pool plus an immediate recycling fraction (remin_frac) rather than the TRUTH's direct recycling terms. The candidate also adds several processes not present in TRUTH (detritus pool with remineralization and sinking, quadratic zooplankton mortality, time-varying assimilation efficiency dependent on nutrient limitation, and explicit seasonal forcing). Integration is done with forward Euler (discrete time steps), not a continuous ODE integrator.",
