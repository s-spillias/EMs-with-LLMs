Assessment and rationale

Fit evaluation:
- The model emits log-scale residuals (N_resid_log, P_resid_log, Z_resid_log), but no residuals file was provided here. Please share it to enable quantitative assessment (bias, autocorrelation, seasonality, variance vs. level).
- Qualitatively, models with only quadratic zooplankton mortality often misrepresent low-density zooplankton dynamics (overly persistent Z at low prey) and the timing of nutrient regeneration.

Project context alignment:
- The current N–P–Z(+D) structure is appropriate for a mixed-layer plankton system: Monod nutrient limitation for P, Holling type III grazing G(P, Z), seasonal environmental modifier on P growth, detrital pool with remineralization and sinking, and deep mixing.
- Observation model uses lognormal errors with a stabilizing minimum SD. The time stepping avoids data leakage by using only previous-step states.

Potential oversimplifications:
- Zooplankton losses are purely quadratic; real systems exhibit baseline metabolic losses (respiration/excretion) that scale approximately linearly with biomass.
- Mixing is constant; in many systems it varies seasonally. If residuals show phase errors in N, a seasonally varying k_mix could be considered later.
- Phytoplankton losses lack density-dependent (quadratic) terms; if P blooms are too sharp in fits, adding a weak quadratic P loss could help, but this was deferred to keep the model simple.

Chosen improvement (one change):
- Add linear zooplankton mortality/respiration (mZ_linear, d^-1). This represents baseline metabolic losses and excretion independent of Z density (in contrast to density-dependent mortality).
- Justification: Improves ecological realism with minimal complexity, often stabilizes dynamics, enhances timing of N regeneration, and helps fit cases where Z is overpredicted during low-prey periods.
- Implementation summary:
  - dZ/dt = β_eff G − mZ_linear Z − mZ_quadratic Z^2
  - Loss partitioning to nutrients and detritus now includes mZ_linear Z in addition to other losses, with the same remin_frac split.
  - All changes use previous-step states only, preserving no data leakage.

Parameter review:
- Values are reasonable starting points; no entries are flagged as updated_from_literature = true. If new literature values are available, share them; we can revisit structure (e.g., alternative grazing forms, seasonal mixing, or light-temperature modifiers).

Next steps (data-dependent):
- After fitting with mZ_linear, review residuals. If N residuals show seasonal phase bias, consider seasonal variation in k_mix. If P residual variance increases with level, consider a weak quadratic P loss or revisiting σ parameters.
