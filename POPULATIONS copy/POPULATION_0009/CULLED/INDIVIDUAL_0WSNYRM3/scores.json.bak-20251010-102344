  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure with Monod-type nutrient uptake, a Holling-type grazing, assimilation/recycling and a mixing/entrainment flux. Key differences vs the TRUTH Python NPZ: (1) uptake/growth is implemented as Monod * seasonal light modifier (f_env) rather than the exact a/(b + c*P) factor in TRUTH; (2) recycling is handled via an explicit detritus pool and partitioning (immediate remineralization fraction + D remineralization) instead of the TRUTH's direct zooplankton recycling terms; (3) mixing is present for nutrients (k_mix*(N_deep - N)) matching TRUTH's mixing form, but the candidate omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing loss term found in TRUTH; (4) zooplankton assimilation is dynamic (beta_eff) and zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms. Numerically the candidate uses forward Euler integration (discrete steps), while TRUTH integrates continuously with RK45. Overall the candidate matches the canonical ecological components but often via alternate (and in places extended) formulations.",
