  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure but with several purposeful extensions and some structural differences from the TRUTH Python NPZ. Uptake/growth is a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) formulation multiplied by a seasonal environmental modifier (f_env) rather than the TRUTH model's N/(e+N) * a/(b + cP) form. Grazing is a Holling type\u2011III / Hill functional form equivalent to the TRUTH grazing (generalized via a hill_exponent). Zooplankton growth is via assimilated grazing but the candidate allows nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency (beta_eff). Nutrient recycling is present but partitioned through an explicit detritus pool (D) with remineralization and sinking, instead of the TRUTH\u2019s direct recycling terms. Mixing/entrainment of nutrients is present and matches the TRUTH mixing term in form. The candidate omits an explicit phytoplankton physical loss term (mixing/entrainment applied to P) present in the TRUTH model, and it uses forward Euler integration (numerical implementation difference) rather than an ODE integrator.",
