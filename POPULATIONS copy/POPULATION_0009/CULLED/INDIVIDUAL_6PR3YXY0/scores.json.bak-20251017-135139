  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements all canonical NPZ processes (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing loss, mortality, mixing; zooplankton growth and mortality). Many terms map clearly to families in the literature rather than being algebraic clones of the TRUTH code: nutrient limitation is Monod-like, light limitation is explicit with exponential self-shading, grazing is a Hill/Holling functional response with an assimilation efficiency, and recycling is explicitly partitioned among mortality, excretion and egestion. The candidate also adds several realistic ecological extensions (temperature Q10 modifiers, explicit light/self-shading and a flexible co-limitation operator, explicit egestion routing and quadratic zooplankton mortality) that are not present in the TRUTH NPZ formulation. Overall, the candidate is ecologically complete and uses standard alternate formulations for several components rather than exact algebraic equality with TRUTH.",
