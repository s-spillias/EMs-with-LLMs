  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with the canonical sinks/sources (uptake, recycling, mixing, grazing, mortality, assimilation) but using different mathematical choices and additional processes compared to the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient term combined with an explicit light limitation and a smooth co-limitation operator (a smooth \"min\"), rather than the exact multiplicative form used in TRUTH. Grazing is a Holling/Hill-type functional response (general h exponent) similar in spirit to TRUTH\u2019s P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating predation but more flexible. Mixing for nutrients matches TRUTH algebraically. The candidate also adds several processes absent from TRUTH (temperature Q10 modifiers on rates, quadratic Z mortality, explicit Z dilution/mixing, an explicit co-limitation operator, and an explicit egestion-to-nutrients routing parameterization). Numerical integration is explicit Euler in the candidate (discrete timesteps) vs. the TRUTH continuous ODE integration; this is a numerical rather than ecological-modeling difference but can affect dynamics.",
