  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ cycle and includes all canonical roles (uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing, mortalities, mixing for P and Z). It differs from the TRUTH equations mainly in specific functional choices: phytoplankton uptake/growth is implemented as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten / Monod) nutrient term co-limited with a separate light limitation and multiplied by a Q10 temperature modifier (co-limitation via a smooth \u2018\u2018soft-min\u2019\u2019 exponent), whereas TRUTH uses a nutrient term multiplied by a P-dependent denominator a/(b + c P). Grazing is a Hill/Holling functional response (generalized Type II/III) with an explicit assimilation efficiency and routing of unassimilated biomass to dissolved nutrients and particulate remineralization; TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) form for predation. Mixing for nutrients is algebraically equivalent to TRUTH (linear exchange), and P linear mortality and P-mixing are present and match TRUTH form. The candidate adds explicit temperature dependence (Q10), light limitation/co-limitation, explicit egestion/excretion/removal routing (AE_Z, phi_eg_N, ex_Z, r_PN, r_ZN), quadratic zooplankton mortality and explicit dilution of Z \u2014 processes not present (or explicit) in the TRUTH NPZ.",
