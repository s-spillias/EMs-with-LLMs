  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ system with the same high-level ecological roles as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing losses, mortality, mixing; zooplankton growth and mortality). However the mathematical implementations differ in important ways: uptake/growth are cast as a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) style uptake combined with a smooth co-limitation (smooth-min) of nutrient and light and multiplied by a Q10 temperature modifier (an extra process). Grazing is implemented as a general Holling/Hill functional response (exponent h) with explicit assimilation (AE_Z) and explicit egestion/excretion routing to nutrients. Zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms (extra density-dependent mortality). Physical mixing/dilution is implemented similarly for N and P but is also applied to Z in the candidate. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles in TRUTH but uses alternate functional forms (and adds temperature dependence and more explicit recycling/closure routes).",

This is a Monod-style nutrient term multiplied by a co-limitation factor, not the exact TRUTH form \"-(N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c*P))*P\" but an alternate Monod/co-limit implementation."
