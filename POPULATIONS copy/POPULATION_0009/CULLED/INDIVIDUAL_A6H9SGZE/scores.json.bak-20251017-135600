  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient uptake, grazing, remineralization, mixing, and zooplankton growth/mortality) but uses different mathematical formulations in several places compared to the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a Monod-like nutrient term combined with an explicit seasonal light driver via a smooth, Liebig-like co-limitation function (an alternate to TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) light/attenuation term). Grazing is a Holling-III/Hill form with an added Beddington\u2013DeAngelis predator-interference factor (an added complexity relative to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Recycling is present but implemented as a fraction (phiRem) of summed losses (Lp + Lz + unassimilated grazing) returned to N, and mixing is implemented identically to TRUTH (linear exchange toward an external N). The candidate also includes several additional ecological/processual elements not present in TRUTH (seasonal light driver, explicit co-limitation function, predator interference, explicit assimilation/uptake efficiency, quadratic mortalities, and a remineralization fraction). One notable omission relative to TRUTH is an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking loss term in dP/dt (TRUTH has a -(s + k)*P term; the candidate applies mixing only to N). Numerically the candidate uses forward Euler with softplus stabilization and parameter-mapping/penalties, which is implementation detail but can affect dynamics compared with TRUTH's ODE integrator.",
