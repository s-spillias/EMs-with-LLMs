  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with all canonical flux directions present (N uptake by P, recycling to N, physical exchange, P growth and losses, Z growth and mortality). Many terms are close in functional role to the TRUTH model but several are implemented using commonly-used alternate formulations and additional ecological processes. Uptake is a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) term multiplied by a smooth co-limitation (nutrient \u00d7 light) and temperature (Q10). Grazing is a Hill/Holling functional response (generalized Holling with exponent h). Recycling is explicit and more detailed (excretion, egestion, separable remineralization fractions, quadratic Z mortality). Physical mixing/dilution is present and applied to N, P and Z. Overall: matches TRUTH in structure (all three equations and main fluxes) but uses alternates or richer forms for many subcomponents and adds several extra processes not in TRUTH.",
