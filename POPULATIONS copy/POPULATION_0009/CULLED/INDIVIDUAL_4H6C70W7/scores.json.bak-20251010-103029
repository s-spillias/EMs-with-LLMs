  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements all canonical NPZ processes present in the TRUTH model but often with different mathematical choices or added realism (temperature modifier, smooth co-limitation, explicit egestion/excretion, quadratic Z mortality, and explicit mixing parameters). Some components are essentially identical in form (mixing/dilution, linear P mortality, P mixing, assimilated growth of Z), while others use common alternate formulations from the literature (Monod nutrient uptake + smooth 'minimum' co-limitation, Holling/Hill grazing with flexible exponent, remineralization via mortality/excretion/egestion). Overall the candidate captures the same ecological roles, with a mix of TRUTH_MATCH and ALTERNATE implementations.",
