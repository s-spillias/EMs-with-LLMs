  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (N uptake \u2192 P growth \u2192 Z grazing \u2192 recycling) but with more mechanistic detail and a few structural differences. Uptake is implemented as a Monod-style nutrient term combined with an explicit light limitation and a smooth co-limitation (power-mean / smooth-min) and scaled by a Q10 temperature modifier (alternate to TRUTH's combined N\u00d7light term). Grazing is a generalized Hill/Holling functional response (covers the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form as a special case). Recycling is explicit and split into mortality remineralization, excretion and egestion routing. Mixing/dilution is linear and matches TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton, but the candidate also applies dilution to zooplankton (not in TRUTH). Overall most canonical components are present; several are implemented as alternating, more detailed formulations.",
