PROJECT CONTEXT: Dynamical behaviour of a simple NPZ (nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton) model for the oceanic mixed layer

Assessment

1) Model fit to data
- A quantitative assessment of fit normally requires the residuals time series. The residuals file was not provided here, so I cannot compute or summarize fit metrics (e.g., bias, autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity) or diagnose time-localized misfits.
- Qualitative expectations based on this structure: with Monod nutrient limitation, Holling type III grazing, seasonal forcing on phytoplankton growth, and mixing to a deep nutrient pool, the model should capture: spring/summer bloom onset (from rising seasonal modifier), subsequent top-down control by zooplankton, and nutrient drawdown followed by winter replenishment via mixing.
- Pending action: when residuals are available, examine log-residuals for N, P, Z by time and against predicted values. In particular, look for: (a) overprediction of Z under nutrient-poor conditions, (b) excessive top-down suppression of P following nutrient drawdown, and (c) phase errors tied to the seasonal term.

2) Effectiveness for the PROJECT CONTEXT
- The current model directly represents the mixed-layer NPZ dynamics with:
  - Resource limitation: Monod function of dissolved nutrient (N).
  - Consumer–resource interaction: Holling type III grazing on P by Z, providing a low-P refuge.
  - Loss processes: linear phytoplankton mortality/exudation, quadratic zooplankton mortality.
  - Recycling: a fraction of unassimilated ingestion and mortality immediately remineralized to N.
  - Physical driver: mixing relaxing N toward a deep source (N_deep).
  - Seasonality: a smooth logistic-sine environmental modifier acting on phytoplankton growth.
- These are standard and reasonable assumptions for a compact NPZ mixed-layer model, so the formulation is aligned with the context.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Food quality and variable assimilation efficiency: Zooplankton assimilation efficiency is held constant (beta). In reality, beta often declines when phytoplankton are nutrient-poor (poor stoichiometric quality), reducing growth of Z and increasing excretion/recycling.
- Temperature/season effects on grazing: The seasonal modifier currently modulates phytoplankton growth only; grazing rates can also be sensitive to temperature.
- Zooplankton linear mortality: Only quadratic mortality is included (a closure for higher-trophic predation). A small linear loss can stabilize low-biomass dynamics.
- Detrital/sinking pool: All non-remineralized losses leave the system implicitly; a detritus pool could capture delayed recycling, but this adds state complexity.
- Light-explicit limitation: The seasonal modifier stands in for light; explicit light limitation would require additional drivers and is not necessary for a single-season timeseries.

Parameter review and updates
- All provided parameters are marked updated_from_literature = false; no entries indicate a literature-updated value that would force a structural change.
- Ranges and descriptions are coherent and biologically plausible. No immediate rescaling or functional-form change is required on this basis alone.

Chosen improvement: Variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency linked to nutrient status
- Rationale: Under nutrient limitation, phytoplankton tend to be of lower nutritional quality. Zooplankton then assimilate a smaller fraction of ingested biomass, which reduces Z growth yield and increases recycling. This mechanism frequently improves fits where models otherwise overpredict Z following nutrient drawdown and over-suppress P late in blooms.
- Mathematical change:
  - Define f_N = N / (K_N + N) (already used) based on the previous-step nutrient.
  - Replace constant beta with an effective assimilation efficiency:
    beta_eff = beta * [ beta_min_frac + (1 − beta_min_frac) * f_N ]
    where beta_min_frac in [0,1] controls the floor of assimilation efficiency under severe nutrient limitation.
  - Update equations:
    dZ/dt = beta_eff * G(P,Z) − mZ_quadratic * Z^2
    Unassimilated ingestion term becomes (1 − beta_eff) * G(P,Z)
    Recycling term becomes: remin_frac * [ (1 − beta_eff) * G + mP * P + mZ_quadratic * Z^2 ]
- Expected ecological effects:
  - When N is low (f_N small), beta_eff declines, reducing zooplankton growth yield and easing top-down control on P; this can better reproduce observed late-bloom/oligotrophic dynamics.
  - Increased unassimilated fraction enhances immediate recycling to N, potentially sharpening nutrient rebound and improving phase alignment into the next growth season.
- Complexity justification: This is a single-parameter extension that captures a well-documented feedback (food quality). It preserves the model’s simplicity while improving ecological realism and potentially resolving systematic residual patterns often seen in NPZ fits.

Implementation summary
- Added a new parameter beta_min_frac (dimensionless, [0,1]) with an initial estimate and bounds.
- Modified the model to compute beta_eff at each step using only previous-step states (no data leakage).
- Replaced constant beta in zooplankton growth and unassimilated flows with beta_eff to maintain mass balance.

Next steps upon availability of residuals
- Reassess fit with the new mechanism enabled. If residuals still show temperature-driven misfits in Z, consider allowing seasonal modulation of grazing rates. If low-Z instability is diagnosed, consider adding a small linear zooplankton mortality term as a secondary refinement.
