  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements all canonical NPZ processes present in the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing loss, mortality, mixing; Z growth and mortality). Functional forms differ in many places: the candidate uses a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient term combined with a smooth co-limitation (power-mean / smooth-min) and an exponential self-shading light term, whereas the TRUTH code uses N/(e+N) times aP/(b + cP) light-like term. Grazing in TRUTH is a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Type III-like) form; the candidate implements a general Hill/Holling function Ph/(Kh+Ph) with exponent h. Recycling and mortality are implemented more explicitly in the candidate (mortality, excretion, egestion routing, linear+quadratic Z mortality). Mixing/dilution is present and matches the TRUTH form algebraically. Overall the roles match; many forms are ALTERNATE choices from the literature, with several exact structural matches (mixing, linear P mortality).",
