  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure: phytoplankton take up dissolved nutrient and are limited by nutrient and light, zooplankton graze on phytoplankton and grow with an assimilation efficiency, and mortality + mixing recycle biomass to nutrients. Many functional forms differ from the TRUTH code but map onto common literature families (Monod uptake, Hill/Holling grazing, linear mortality). The candidate also adds several ecological processes absent from the TRUTH NPZ (temperature/Q10 effects, explicit light with self-shading, explicit excretion/egestion routing, quadratic zooplankton mortality). Numerical integration is explicit Euler in the candidate vs. continuous ODE solve in TRUTH, which is an implementation difference that can affect dynamics.",
