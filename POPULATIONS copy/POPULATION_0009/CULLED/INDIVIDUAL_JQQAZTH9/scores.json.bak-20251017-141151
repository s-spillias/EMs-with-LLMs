  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with uptake, recycling, mixing, grazing, mortality and zooplankton growth. Many processes are present and map directly to the TRUTH model but often with different mathematical choices or extra modifiers. Nutrient uptake and light/nutrient co-limitation are implemented via Monod-type terms combined by a smooth power-mean (co-limitation) and temperature (Q10) scaling. Grazing is a Hill/Holling-type functional response (generalized exponent h) that is algebraically equivalent to the TRUTH Type-III grazing when h=2. Mixing/dilution is explicit and matches the TRUTH dilution form. Candidate adds explicit temperature (Q10) modifiers on rates, an excretion term that is not tied to zooplankton mortality in the same way as TRUTH, and an explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Overall the candidate is ecologically complete relative to TRUTH, uses widely used alternates for uptake/co-limitation and grazing, and includes a few extra processes (temperature dependence, explicit excretion, density-dependent Z mortality).",
