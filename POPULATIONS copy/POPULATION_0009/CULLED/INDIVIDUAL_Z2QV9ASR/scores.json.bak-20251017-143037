  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with the three state variables N, P, Z and explicit uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling and mixing terms. Functional forms differ from the TRUTH Python model in several places: the candidate uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake combined with a smooth co-limitation (smooth-Liebig) of nutrient and light, a Hill/Holling grazing functional response, explicit assimilation/excretion/egestion routing and a temperature (Q10) multiplier. Mixing (exchange with source water) is present and implemented as a linear entrainment term, matching the TRUTH form for nutrients and phytoplankton but applied also to zooplankton in the candidate. Overall the candidate matches all canonical ecological roles but often with alternate standard functional forms and several additional processes (temperature dependence, quadratic Z mortality, explicit excretion/egestion routing, dilution of Z).",
