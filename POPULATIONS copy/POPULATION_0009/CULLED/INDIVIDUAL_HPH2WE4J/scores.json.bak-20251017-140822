  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the same core processes as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling, and mixing of nutrients). However the mathematical choices differ in some places: uptake/growth use a standard Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) term multiplied by an explicit seasonal/light modifier (f_env) rather than the TRUTH's P-dependent light term; grazing is a Holling\u2011III style response (matching TRUTH family); recycling is done via an explicit remineralization fraction applied to unassimilated grazing and mortalities (a different closure than TRUTH); zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic term. The candidate omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking loss (present in TRUTH as s + k acting on P).",
