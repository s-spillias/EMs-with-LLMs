  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with all three state equations (N, P, Z) and includes nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, and zooplankton growth. Many functional forms are ecologically equivalent to the TRUTH model but realized with different mathematical choices: uptake/growth is implemented as Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient limitation co-limited with light via an exponential self-shading and a smooth co-limitation operator (an alternate to the TRUTH algebraic form), grazing is a Hill/Holling-type response (can reproduce TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) when h=2), mixing is the same linear exchange formulation, and zooplankton growth is assimilation*ingestion as in TRUTH. The candidate also adds realistic extra processes not explicit in TRUTH (temperature Q10 modifiers, an explicit continuous excretion term, and quadratic zooplankton mortality, plus an explicit egestion pathway). Note also the candidate integrates forward in time with Euler steps (discrete-time integration) whereas TRUTH is specified as continuous ODEs solved with RK45.",
