  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing and mortality; zooplankton growth and mortality) but often with alternate mathematical choices. Nutrient uptake is computed indirectly from phytoplankton growth using a Monod-like N/(K+N) term combined with a seasonal light limitation via a smooth Liebig-style co-limitation (an alternate to the TRUTH multiplicative form). Grazing is implemented as a Hill/Holling-III functional response (structurally the same family as TRUTH). The candidate adds explicit assimilation/uptake efficiency and quadratic density-dependent mortalities and an explicit seasonal light driver that are not present in the TRUTH code. Numerical devices (softplus, smooth penalties, forward-Euler stepping) are included for stability and are not ecological processes.",
