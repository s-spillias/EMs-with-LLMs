  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements all canonical NPZ roles (uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing, mortality, mixing; Z growth, mortality, mixing) but often with alternate mathematical choices versus the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light term and a smooth co-limitation (not the exact algebra in TRUTH). Grazing is a Hill/Holling-type functional response (generalized exponent h) with assimilation efficiency. Recycling is explicit (P mortality, Z mortality, excretion, egestion routing) rather than the TRUTH's specific lambda/beta/gamma terms. The candidate also adds several processes not present in TRUTH: temperature (Q10) modifiers on rates, explicit self-shading via exp(-k_I P), a smooth \u201csoft-min\u201d co-limitation formulation (alpha_colim), explicit egestion routing to dissolved N, explicit excretion, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and application of mixed-layer exchange to Z. Overall the candidate is ecologically complete and richer than TRUTH; many differences map to commonly used alternates in the literature.",
