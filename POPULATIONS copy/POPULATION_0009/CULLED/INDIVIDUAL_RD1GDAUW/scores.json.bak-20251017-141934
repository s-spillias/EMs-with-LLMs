  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ model that contains all canonical ecological roles from the TRUTH model (uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing loss, mortality, mixing; Z growth and mortality). Many terms are present but several are implemented with different (and often more general) functional forms: nutrient uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten combined with a co-limiting light term (smooth generalized minimum) rather than the exact TRUTH algebra; grazing is a Hill/Holling functional response family (general h) like the TRUTH Hill-2 form; mixing is implemented identically as linear exchange. The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) modifiers on rates, an explicit exponential self-shading light attenuation (k_I) and density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality, among other routing detail. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but uses alternate mathematical formulations for several components and a few extra processes not present in TRUTH.",

      "explanation": "Uptake appears as `Type uptake  = muP * P_prev;` with `Type muP = mu_max * temp_mod_P * co_lim;` and nutrient limitation `Type fN = N_prev / (K_N + N_prev);`. This is a Michaelis-Menten (Monod) g(N)=N/(K_N+N) combined with a co-limit from light, which differs algebraically from TRUTH's `(N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c * P))*P` but serves the same role."

This matches the ecological role of returning P and Z losses to N but uses explicit mortality, excretion and routing fractions rather than TRUTH's `(+ (beta * lambda_ * P**2/(mu**2 + P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z)` terms."

      "explanation": "P growth is the `uptake` added to P via `Type dP = uptake - grazing - mortP - dilP;` with `uptake = muP * P_prev` and `muP = mu_max * temp_mod_P * co_lim;` where `co_lim` is computed from `fN = N_prev/(K_N+N_prev)` and `fL = L_eff/(K_L + L_eff)`. TRUTH uses a different algebraic product `(N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c*P))*P`, so this is an alternate co-limiting formulation (generalized Liebig/smooth-min + Monod)."
