ASSESSMENT AND RATIONALE

Data fit (residuals)
- A residuals file was referenced but is not included in the current chat. Please provide it for a targeted residual analysis.
- Based on experience with NPZ models of this form, two common misfits occur:
  1) Overestimation of peak P during bloom conditions and too-rapid growth once nutrients become modestly available, because light limitation does not tighten as biomass rises.
  2) Timing/shape mismatches in P and Z peaks (Z lags are often acceptable), sometimes associated with insufficient feedbacks that curb P growth at high biomass.

Project context coverage
- The current model simulates N, P, and Z in the mixed layer with standard processes:
  - Phytoplankton growth is co-limited by nutrient and light via a smooth-min (negative alpha_colim), scaled by Q10 temperature.
  - Zooplankton grazing uses a Hill functional response with temperature scaling and variable assimilation efficiency.
  - Mortality, excretion, mixed-layer exchange, and fast recycling pathways (egestion to dissolved N) are included.
- This structure is appropriate for first-order mixed-layer NPZ dynamics and aligns with the project context.

Potential missing or oversimplified processes
- Light feedback via self-shading: Light limitation currently depends only on an external availability parameter (L_avail) and a half-saturation (K_L). In reality, as P increases, self-shading reduces in situ light, curbing further growth and often improving fits during bloom phases.
- Seasonality or variability in temperature or external light is not represented (T and L_avail are constants). If data span strong seasonal cycles, time-varying drivers may be needed later.
- No explicit detritus pool; unassimilated grazing and excretion are routed directly to N (fast recycling). This can be acceptable for short time scales or systems with rapid remineralization but may miss lags.

Parameter review
- Many parameters are literature-based with plausible bounds. No entries are flagged as “updated_from_literature: true” at present, so no equation-level changes are strictly required by updated values alone.
- Identifiability considerations: mu_max, L_avail, K_L, and any light-modifying parameter can be confounded; care is needed with priors/bounds.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: SELF-SHADING IN LIGHT LIMITATION

Ecological reasoning
- As phytoplankton biomass increases, light in the mixed layer is attenuated (Beer–Lambert effect). Including self-shading provides a negative feedback on P growth at high biomass, which is mechanistically justified and often reduces positive residual bias during bloom peaks.

Mathematical formulation
- Replace the light input to the limitation function with an “effective” light reduced by biomass:
  L_eff(t) = L_avail * exp(-k_I * P(t-1))
- The light limitation becomes:
  f_L(t) = L_eff(t) / (K_L + L_eff(t))
- Co-limitation remains the smooth minimum:
  co_lim(t) = [ (f_N(t)^alpha + f_L(t)^alpha) / 2 ]^(1/alpha), alpha < 0
- All process rates continue to use previous-step states only, avoiding any data leakage.

Implementation notes
- New parameter k_I (units: (g C m^-3)^-1) controls the strength of self-shading; k_I = 0 recovers the original model.
- Minor code changes apply the new formulation at initialization (t=0) and each time step.
- A weak plausibility penalty constrains k_I within a broad range [0, 10].

Expected effects on fit and dynamics
- Reduced overprediction of P at high biomass due to tighter light limitation as blooms develop.
- More realistic nutrient drawdown and possible improvement in timing of P peaks.
- Indirectly, more stable Z dynamics via moderated prey surges.

Next steps (data-driven refinement)
- Once residuals are available, check:
  - P residuals vs predicted P: expect reduced positive bias at high P.
  - Autocorrelation in residuals: should decrease if self-shading explains part of the structure.
  - If residuals still show seasonal structure, consider adding time-varying L_avail or T next.

Parameters.json updates
- L_avail description clarified as an external/surface driver before self-shading.
- Added k_I with bounds [0, 10], initial value 0.5.

Verification
- The updated code uses only previous-step predictions (no use of *_dat in process equations).
- Observation model and diagnostics remain unchanged except that fL_pred now reflects self-shading.
