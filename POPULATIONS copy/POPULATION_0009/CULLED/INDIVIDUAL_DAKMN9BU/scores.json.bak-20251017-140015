  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with several deliberate modeling extensions. Core processes are present: Monod-style nutrient uptake driving phytoplankton growth, Holling-type III grazing that feeds zooplankton growth, linear phytoplankton mortality, and linear zooplankton mortality. Differences from the TRUTH reference include (a) nutrient uptake/growth is modulated by an explicit seasonal/light modifier f_env rather than the TRUTH a/(b + c*P) factor, (b) recycling is handled via an explicit detritus pool and a partitioning parameter (remin_frac) rather than the TRUTH direct recycling terms, and (c) zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic term. Several extra ecological components are therefore present (detritus pool, detritus remineralization & sinking, nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency, seasonal environmental modifier). Numerical implementation (forward Euler) and likelihood/penalty machinery are also present but are modeling/estimation details rather than ecological processes.",
