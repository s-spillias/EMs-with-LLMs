  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZD-style dynamics with Monod nutrient limitation, a Holling-III-like grazing with Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference, assimilation efficiency, explicit detritus pool and remineralization, and nutrient mixing. Many ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ are present (uptake, recycling, mixing, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth), but several terms differ in functional form: the candidate uses f_env(t) (seasonal light/temperature modifier) instead of the TRUTH's P-dependent production factor, uses a BD-interference grazing law rather than the simple P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Holling-III in TRUTH, and implements recycling via a partitioning to an explicit detritus pool plus an immediate remineralization fraction and a nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency (beta_eff). Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but often as alternates or plausible variants; a few TRUTH terms (explicit phytoplankton mixing loss) are missing in the candidate.",
