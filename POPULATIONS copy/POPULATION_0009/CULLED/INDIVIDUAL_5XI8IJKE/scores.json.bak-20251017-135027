  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from mortalities/excretion, mixing/dilution, phytoplankton growth and losses (grazing, mortality, mixing), and zooplankton growth and mortality. However, the candidate uses different (and more mechanistic/parameterized) formulations than the TRUTH script for several components: nutrient uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term combined with an explicit light limitation and a smooth co-limitation (smooth-min) rather than the TRUTH algebraic (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P)) factor; grazing is implemented as a general Hill/Holling functional response (P^h/(K_P^h + P^h)) which is structurally the same family as TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) but parameterized more generally; zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic term not present in TRUTH. The candidate also adds explicit temperature dependence (Q10) and explicit dilution of zooplankton via D_mix, and uses a smooth co-limitation formulation for light/nutrient. Overall, ecological roles are present and mappable to TRUTH and to literature alternates, but not all expressions are algebraically identical.",
