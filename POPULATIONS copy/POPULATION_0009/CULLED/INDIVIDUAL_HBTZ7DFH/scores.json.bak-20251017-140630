  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling terms. Functionally it maps to the same ecological roles in the TRUTH model but uses different functional forms in several places: nutrient uptake is implemented as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) term multiplied by a light co-limitation and a temperature modifier (Q10) rather than the TRUTH's nutrient-by-shading factor (a/(b+cP)). Grazing is a generalized Holling (Hill) form (flexible exponent h) instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2). Phytoplankton linear mortality and recycling to nutrients are present and implemented in an equivalent way to TRUTH. The candidate omits explicit mixing/entrainment for N and P present in TRUTH. The candidate also adds several ecological modifiers/processes not present in the TRUTH reference (temperature/Q10 on growth, explicit light limitation and self-shading, a smooth co-limitation operator, and quadratic zooplankton mortality). Numerical integration is Euler-forward (discrete) in the candidate versus continuous RK integrator in TRUTH (implementation-level difference).",
