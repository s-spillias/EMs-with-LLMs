  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure containing nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing, phytoplankton growth and losses, zooplankton grazing/assimilation and mortality. Several terms match the ecological roles in the TRUTH model but the functional forms differ in places: uptake is implemented as a Monod-type nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light term using a smooth co-limitation (not the same algebraic factor used in TRUTH); grazing is a Hill/Holling form (same family as TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) and thus easily mapped); mixing/dilution is the same linear entrainment form; zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic term and the model adds an explicit temperature/Q10 modifier. Overall the candidate uses literature-typical alternates (Monod + light co-limitation, Hill grazing, linear mortality) with two additional processes not present in TRUTH (Q10 temperature modifier and quadratic Z mortality). Numerical integration (Euler forward in candidate) and an explicit observation (lognormal) model are implementation-level differences.",
