  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing transfer to zooplankton, zooplankton mortality and nutrient mixing) but uses different mathematical choices and adds several processes not present in the TRUTH model. Nutrient uptake is a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) form like TRUTH, but phytoplankton growth multiplies Monod uptake by an explicit seasonal/light modifier (f_env) rather than the TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) term. Grazing is Holling\u2010III style but embedded in a Beddington\u2013DeAngelis denominator (predator interference). Recycling to nutrients is handled via an explicit detritus pool (D) with partitioning (remin_frac) and remineralization/sinking, and assimilation efficiency is dynamic (beta_eff) rather than a fixed constant. One canonical piece in TRUTH \u2014 an explicit phytoplankton physical loss/mixing term (\u2212(s+k)P) \u2014 is not present in the candidate (P has no explicit mixing/export term). Overall: core roles are present but several alternates and extra components are added (detritus pool and processing, seasonal forcing, predator interference, variable assimilation efficiency).",
