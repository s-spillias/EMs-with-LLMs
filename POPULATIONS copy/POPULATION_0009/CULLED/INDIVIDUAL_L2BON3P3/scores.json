  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake into P, recycling to N, mixing, grazing-driven Z growth, and P/Z losses) but with notable structural differences from the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth are represented as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by a seasonal environmental modifier (inv_logit(sin(...))) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) product. Grazing is Holling\u2011III style but extended to a Beddington\u2013DeAngelis (predator interference) denominator and uses a dynamic, nutrient\u2011dependent assimilation efficiency. The model also adds an explicit detritus pool with sinking and remineralization, and zooplankton mortality is quadratic rather than linear as in TRUTH. Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and matches many canonical functions, but several implementations are ALTERNATE rather than exact matches and several extra processes are present.",

TRUTH uses N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c*P)) * P; the candidate replaces the TRUTH light/self-shading factor with an explicit seasonal modifier f_env, so form is an alternate Monod-style uptake."
