  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with all canonical roles present: nutrient uptake (Monod-style) co-limited by light, phytoplankton growth and linear mortality, zooplankton grazing with a Hill/Holling functional response and assimilation to Z, recycling to dissolved N via multiple pathways, and physical mixing/dilution. Many functional forms are alternate parameterizations to the TRUTH Python model (e.g., generalized co-limitation and exponential self-shading for light, explicit Hill exponent for grazing) rather than exact algebraic matches. The candidate also adds several mechanistic details absent from TRUTH (temperature/Q10 scaling of rates, explicit excretion and egestion routing, quadratic Z mortality, and dilution applied to Z).",
