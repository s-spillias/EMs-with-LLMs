  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Monod-type nutrient limitation, a Holling-type III grazing, recycling of unassimilated ingestion and mortality, and vertical mixing of nutrients. Many functional roles in the TRUTH model are present but implemented with different algebraic choices: nutrient uptake/growth uses f_N * seasonal f_env (Monod \u00d7 seasonal modifier) rather than the TRUTH\u2019s N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) form; grazing is Holling-III in both models (structurally equivalent); zooplankton growth is grazing\u00d7assimilation but the candidate makes assimilation nutrient-dependent (beta_eff(f_N)) whereas TRUTH uses a constant alpha; zooplankton mortality is quadratic in the candidate versus linear in TRUTH. The candidate also omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH and adds a seasonal environmental modifier and nutrient-dependent assimilation as extra processes.",
