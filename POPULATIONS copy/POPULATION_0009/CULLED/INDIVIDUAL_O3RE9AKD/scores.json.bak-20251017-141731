  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (N, P, Z states) with Monod-type nutrient limitation, an explicit light limitation, Holling/Hill grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, and recycling to nutrients. Several terms map closely to the TRUTH model (notably recycling from grazing and P mortality, and assimilation-driven Z growth). Differences: the candidate uses a smooth Liebig-style co-limitation (smooth-min) and an explicit Q10 temperature modifier on growth (absent in TRUTH), uses an Euler integrator (numerics only), and includes density-dependent (quadratic) Z mortality (TRUTH only had linear Z loss). The candidate also omits an explicit physical mixing/dilution term for N and P that appears in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and (s + k)*P). Overall, most ecological roles are present but implemented with common alternate functional forms (smooth co-limitation, Hill/Holling grazing, explicit Q10, quadratic Z loss).",
