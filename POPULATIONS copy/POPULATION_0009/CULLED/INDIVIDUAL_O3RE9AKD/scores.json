  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (uptake -> P growth, grazing -> Z growth with assimilation, remineralization -> N, and linear mortality) but uses alternate functional forms and adds a few processes not present in the TRUTH script. Nutrient uptake is a Monod/Monod+light co-limited formulation (with a smooth-min co-limiter and an explicit Q10 temperature modifier) rather than the TRUTH\u2019s N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c P)) * P form. Grazing is implemented as a generalized Holling (P^h/(K_P^h+P^h)) which matches the family of the TRUTH Holling-type (TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Recycling pathways are explicit and match the ecological roles in TRUTH (unassimilated grazing -> N, P mortality -> N, Z mortality -> N) though parameterization differs. Important mismatches: the candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing (entrainment/dilution) term for nutrients and omits the explicit P mixing/sinking term present in TRUTH, and it adds extra processes (Q10 temperature modifier, explicit zooplankton excretion, and a quadratic density-dependent Z mortality term). Numerical/implementation differences (Euler stepping, lognormal observation model, smooth parameter penalties, initialisation from observations) are present but are modeling/estimation choices rather than core ecological processes.",
