  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the same high-level NPZ structure as the TRUTH model (N, P, Z states with uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling and mixing), but uses different functional forms for several processes. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation co-limited with an explicit light term via a smooth \"min\" (co_lim) and a temperature Q10 modifier (alternate to the TRUTH N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) form). Grazing is a Holling/Hill-type functional response (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Recycling, mixing for N and P, and linear phytoplankton mortality match TRUTH conceptually (mixing for N is structurally equivalent). The candidate adds several processes not present in TRUTH (explicit light limitation/co-limitation, temperature Q10 modifier, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and zooplankton dilution/mixing). Overall many canonical components are present but several are implemented as literature alternates and a few extra ecological processes are included.",
