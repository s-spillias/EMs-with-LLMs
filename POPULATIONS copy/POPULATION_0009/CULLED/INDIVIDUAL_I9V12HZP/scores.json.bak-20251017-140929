  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N uptake -> P growth -> Z grazing -> recycling + mixing) and so matches the TRUTH model in all major ecological roles. Differences are mostly in functional-form choices and extra ecological modifiers: uptake/growth are implemented as Monod-type nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light co-limitation via a smooth power-mean (co-limitation) and multiplied by a Q10 temperature modifier (extra). Grazing is a Hill/Holling-type functional response (with flexible exponent h) which is algebraically equivalent to the TRUTH grazing when h=2. Mixing is an explicit D_mix*(N_in - N) term, directly matching the TRUTH mixing form. Recycling is present but decomposed into mortality-derived remineralization, excretion, and parameterized fractions (r_PN, r_ZN, ex_Z) rather than the exact TRUTH coefficients. The candidate also includes an additional quadratic zooplankton mortality term and an independent excretion term (ex_Z) and a temperature/Q10 modifier \u2014 these are extra processes not present in the TRUTH file.",
