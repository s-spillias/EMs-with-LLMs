  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure with Monod nutrient limitation, a Holling\u2010III grazing functional response, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, recycling of unassimilated ingestion and mortalities, and a vertical mixing term for nutrients. It differs from the TRUTH NPZ primarily in (1) replacing the TRUTH phytoplankton light/P-dependent modifier a/(b + c*P) with an explicit seasonal environmental modifier f_env(t), (2) using quadratic zooplankton mortality rather than TRUTH's linear loss, and (3) omitting an explicit mixing/entrainment loss term for P and Z. Many functional forms match standard alternates in the literature (Monod uptake, Holling III grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, quadratic zooplankton mortality, remineralization fraction).",
