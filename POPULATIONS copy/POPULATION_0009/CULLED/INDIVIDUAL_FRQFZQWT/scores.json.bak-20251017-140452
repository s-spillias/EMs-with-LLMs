  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure: Monod-type nutrient uptake driving phytoplankton growth, Holling-type grazing transferring carbon to zooplankton with an assimilation efficiency, recycling of unassimilated/growth losses back to nutrients, and vertical mixing of nutrients. Several terms are algebraically equivalent to the TRUTH model (mixing, Holling\u2011III grazing, assimilation-driven Z growth). Differences: (1) phytoplankton growth uses a Monod nutrient term plus an explicit seasonal environmental modifier (inv_logit(sin(...))) rather than the TRUTH's P-dependent rate factor (a/(b + c*P)); (2) zooplankton mortality is quadratic rather than the TRUTH's linear mortality; (3) recycling is implemented as a single remineralization fraction on unassimilated + mortalities rather than the TRUTH's split terms. The candidate also omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss term present in TRUTH.",
