  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ with all canonical compartments (N, P, Z) and includes the expected processes: phytoplankton uptake/growth, grazing, mortality, recycling, and physical mixing. Mechanistically it uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake combined with an explicit light limitation and a smooth co-limitation (generalized mean / smooth-Liebig) plus a temperature (Q10) modifier. Grazing is implemented as a Hill/Holling functional response (general h) with an explicit assimilation efficiency. Recycling to nutrients is handled via mortality fractions and an explicit excretion term rather than the TRUTH\u2019s predator-unassimilated term. The model also includes mixed-layer dilution applied to N, P and Z. Several processes present in the candidate are not represented in the TRUTH code (notably explicit temperature dependence, explicit light/co-limitation formulation, quadratic Z mortality, and explicit excretion). Overall the candidate matches the canonical ecological roles but differs in some formulations and adds additional biologically-relevant processes.",
