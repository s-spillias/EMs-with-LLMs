  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same core NPZ roles as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake -> P growth, grazing -> Z growth, recycling to N, and mixing/dilution). Many processes are present but the mathematical forms differ in important ways: the candidate uses an explicit Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light co\u2011limitation (smooth co\u2011limit/soft-min), and applies a temperature (Q10) modifier to biological rates. Grazing is implemented as a general Hill/Holling functional response (parametric exponent h) which can reproduce the TRUTH\u2019s P^2/(mu^2+P^2) when h=2, but is more flexible. Zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms (candidate), whereas TRUTH only has a linear Z loss. Mixing/dilution (N_in - N) and dilution of P and Z are implemented in equivalent forms. Overall, most canonical components are present but often as alternates from the literature (Monod uptake, Hill/Holling grazing, explicit light co-limitation, Q10 temperature dependence, quadratic Z mortality).",
