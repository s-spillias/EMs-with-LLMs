Assessment and rationale for a targeted ecological improvement

1) Model fit to data
- Note: A residuals file was referenced but not provided in this chat context. Without residuals, I cannot quantify biases (e.g., timing offsets, peak magnitude errors, persistence) from observed-minus-predicted diagnostics. Please provide the residuals to refine this assessment.
- Structural fit expectations: The current model already contains outbreak-enabling mechanisms: (i) fecundity and larval survival boosted by food (coral cover) and temperature, (ii) an SST anomaly-driven pulse, (iii) an Allee effect, (iv) a maturation delay via a juvenile stage, and (v) adult mortality that increases with temperature and food scarcity. These features should produce boom–bust dynamics qualitatively. However, models with only fecundity pulses and weak post-peak feedbacks often over-predict persistence (outbreaks that last too long) and produce peaks that are too broad or recur too regularly.

2) Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT
- The project emphasizes capturing timing, magnitude, and duration of episodic outbreaks. The present structure supports episodicity (SST anomaly pulse + Allee gate) and magnitude control (density dependence via Ricker term exp(-beta * C)). Duration control hinges on strong negative feedbacks post-peak. Existing adult mortality modifiers (food, temperature) help, but feedbacks acting on early stages (settlement/juvenile) are a primary regulator in COTS ecology and can sharpen busts immediately after peaks.
- Selective predation on coral is represented with prey-specific rates, saturation, and food preference; bleaching/thermal effects on coral are included.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Early-stage density dependence via cannibalism/competition: Evidence suggests strong post-settlement mortality from conspecifics (juvenile-on-juvenile or adult-on-juvenile cannibalism), which intensifies at high COTS densities and can rapidly collapse cohorts following outbreaks.
- External nutrient/runoff drivers of larval survival are not included due to lack of runoff/river data streams; adding a new data vector would require additional inputs.
- Predator control on adults is not explicitly modeled (would require added assumptions/data).
- Predation functional response already allows type-II/III behavior and a smooth cap; prey switching is partially represented by a diet preference parameter.

Chosen improvement: Add density-dependent juvenile mortality from conspecific crowding/cannibalism
- Ecological reasoning: Following a boom in adult COTS, juvenile densities and encounter rates rise sharply. Cannibalism and interference among juveniles (and by adults on juveniles) can strongly reduce juvenile survival, truncating outbreak duration and creating more realistic busts. This is a key feedback missing in the current stage-transition equation for juveniles, which uses a constant survival sJ.
- Mathematical form: Modify juvenile survival to include an exponential crowding penalty based on total local COTS density D_t = C_t + J_t:
  sJ_eff(t) = sJ * exp(-k_can * D_t)
  with k_can ≥ 0. This multiplicative factor preserves sJ as the baseline survival at low densities, while ensuring survival decreases smoothly as density increases. The exp(·) form is standard for continuous-time mortality aggregated annually and keeps sJ_eff in (0,1).
- Implementation: Replace J_survive = sJ * J_t with J_survive = sJ_eff * J_t where sJ_eff = sJ * exp(-k_can * (C_t + J_t)).
- Expected effect on dynamics: Strengthens negative feedback immediately after peaks, yielding sharper, shorter outbreaks (reduced duration), better aligning with observed boom–bust cycles. It also helps prevent unrealistically high sustained recruitment when adult abundance remains elevated.

Parameterization
- Introduce a single new parameter log_k_can (k_can = exp(log_k_can)) to control the strength of density-dependent juvenile mortality. Initial value: log_k_can ≈ -2.302585 (k_can ≈ 0.1 (indiv m^-2)^-1) with broad, biologically plausible bounds. This keeps added complexity minimal (one parameter) while delivering a meaningful ecological mechanism.

Notes on other parameters and structure
- No changes to existing fecundity pulse or adult temperature mortality are required by current parameter values; their roles remain complementary: pulses create booms; food/temperature adult mortality and the new juvenile cannibalism feedback create busts.
- If residuals later show peak timing lag, consider allowing a temperature- or food-dependent maturation fraction mJ, but that is not introduced here to keep the change focused.

Next steps
- Please provide the residuals file to verify reductions in post-peak positive residuals for COTS abundance and to tune k_can. We would expect improved fit around the decay phase of outbreaks without degrading peak timing or magnitude.
