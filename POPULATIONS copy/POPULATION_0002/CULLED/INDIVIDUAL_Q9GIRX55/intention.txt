ASSESSMENT

1) Model fit to data
- The residuals file was not provided in this chat, so I could not directly inspect residuals. Typical issues in similar COTS models include:
  - Underestimation of outbreak peaks (positive residuals during peak years).
  - Over-smoothing of boom-bust transitions (autocorrelated residuals).
  - Coral cover residuals showing systematic underprediction during outbreak years for Acropora and slower correction for massive corals.

2) Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths:
  - The model includes: selective predation on coral groups, a Type-III (sigmoidal) response (H) that captures accelerating predation at higher COTS densities, thermal performance for COTS reproduction (TPC), food-limited carrying capacity (K_eff), Allee effects, and immigration. These elements are consistent with boom-bust dynamics.
- Key gap:
  - In the coral equations, predation loss is currently independent of predator density magnitude, depending only on the saturating “predation intensity” H(C). This means once H approaches 1, the coral loss rate no longer increases with rising COTS density, which dampens the amplitude of outbreaks and weakens feedbacks that drive rapid coral declines during outbreak peaks.

3) Key ecological processes missing or oversimplified
- Predation scaling with predator density in coral loss terms (major structural shortcoming; see above).
- Potential drivers not represented (left as future work to avoid overfitting/overcomplication without data):
  - Nutrient/runoff-induced pulses in larval survival (could modulate recruitment).
  - Stage structure (juvenile cohorts and delayed density dependence).
  - Predator control on COTS, disease, or removal programs.
  - Handling time and interference among starfish (beyond the Type-III proxy).

PARAMETER REVIEW AND CONSISTENCY CHECKS

- Updated-from-literature values in parameters.json indicate:
  - m_C has a fixed/literature-derived value ~2.56 year^-1 with very tight bounds.
  - Topt_C narrowed to the 28–29°C range.
- The existing model.cpp used soft penalties inconsistent with these updated bounds:
  - m_C was penalized into [0,2], contradicting the literature update.
  - Topt_C was penalized into [24,32], broader than the updated evidence.
- I aligned model.cpp penalties with parameters.json to maintain ecological realism and avoid biasing estimates away from supported values.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT

Approach: Resource limitation mechanisms and higher-order predator-prey nonlinearity
- Change: Make coral predation losses scale with both the Type-III response H(C) and the predator density C (COTS), i.e., per-capita clearing rate × predator density × prey availability.
- Rationale:
  - Ecologically, total consumption should scale with predator abundance. Using only H(C) without C suppresses increasing impact during outbreaks, undermining the ability to reproduce fast-onset coral declines concurrent with COTS peaks.
  - This introduces a nonlinearity that can sharpen boom-bust cycles: high COTS densities accelerate coral losses, reducing food, which then feeds back into COTS starvation/increased mortality. It also increases fecundity-coupled recruitment via the existing rec_from_food term, reinforcing outbreak peaks.
- Mathematical change (proportion-per-year scale in the process step):
  - Before: pred_A = c_attack_A * H(C) * A_prop
           pred_S = c_attack_S * H(C) * S_prop
  - After:  pred_A = c_attack_A * H(C) * C_prev * A_prop
           pred_S = c_attack_S * H(C) * C_prev * S_prop
  - Here c_attack_* are per-capita area-clearing rates (m^2 indiv^-1 year^-1); multiplying by C_prev (indiv m^-2) and the local coral proportion yields a per-year proportion of area removed.

PARAMETER AND UNIT UPDATES

- c_attack_A and c_attack_S units updated from year^-1 to m^2 indiv^-1 year^-1, and descriptions clarified to “per-capita area-clearing attack rates.” Bounds retained but can be narrowed in future if identifiable.
- Model penalties updated to reflect literature-updated parameters:
  - m_C ∈ [2.56, 2.56000000256]
  - Topt_C ∈ [28.0, 29.0]

NOTES ON IMPLEMENTATION

- No current-time-step data are used to compute predictions; only t-1 predicted states feed the t predictions. The change preserves this.
- The change affects:
  - Coral loss terms (predation now scales with COTS density).
  - Recruitment from consumption rec_from_food inherits stronger dependence on predator density (ecologically plausible and desirable for outbreak dynamics).
- Expectation:
  - Sharper coral declines during COTS peaks, improved timing/magnitude of outbreak peaks and subsequent bust due to food feedbacks.

FUTURE EXTENSIONS (not implemented here)
- Add an environmental runoff proxy (when available) to modulate larval survival/recruitment.
- Add handling-time/interference explicitly (e.g., Holling III with predator interference).
- Consider a juvenile stage or delay term if residuals show lagged responses.
