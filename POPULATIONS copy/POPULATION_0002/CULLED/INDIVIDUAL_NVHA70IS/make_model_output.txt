 +  - Resource limitation is modeled with a simple Michaelis-Menten type saturating function. This often smooths responses and can fail to create the sharp transitions typical of outbreaks.                                                           
 +  - No explicit pulse drivers (e.g., nutrient/runoff-induced larval survival surges). Absent exogenous pulses, stronger endogenous nonlinearity in resource-recruitment efficiency is often needed to reproduce boom-bust dynamics.                   
 +  - COTS adult mortality (m_C) is high and tightly constrained (fixed to ≈2.56), implying outbreak peaks require strong, threshold-like recruitment/growth episodes to overcome mortality.

 +- Threshold/nonlinear recruitment efficiency with respect to resource availability (dominant food: fast-growing Acropora) is oversimplified as a first-order saturation. Empirically, larval survival and successful recruitment can respond          
 superlinearly to food (and environmental conditions), producing episodic recruitment.

 +- COTS outbreaks often require nonlinearly high larval survival/recruitment when food availability crosses a threshold. A Hill function with exponent ν>1 steepens the transition from low to high efficiency, enabling rapid outbreak onset when cor 
 cover (especially Acropora) is sufficiently high.
