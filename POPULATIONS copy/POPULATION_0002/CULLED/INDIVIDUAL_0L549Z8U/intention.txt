Purpose: Predict episodic boomâ€“bust dynamics of Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef while explicitly coupling their selective predation to the dynamics of fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites corals. The model is discrete-time, uses observed initial conditions, and is designed for forward prediction under environmental forcing.

Ecological functioning:
- COTS dynamics combine survival of adults and recruitment from local reproduction plus exogenous larval immigration. Reproduction is resource-limited by edible coral, enhanced by warm sea temperatures, and dampened by density dependence; adult mortality increases when food is scarce and when COTS density is high (bust mechanism).
- Coral cover for Acropora (fast) and Faviidae/Porites (slow) grows logistically with shared space limitation (competition for substratum). Growth is modulated by temperature through a smooth thermal performance curve (Gaussian around an optimum).
- COTS selectively consume corals using Holling Type II functional responses with higher attack on Acropora. Feeding efficiency increases smoothly near a temperature optimum for activity.
- Resource feedbacks: COTS predation reduces coral cover, which reduces future COTS recruitment and increases COTS mortality when food is scarce, generating self-limiting outbreaks.
- Outbreak triggers and sustainment: Temperature-dependent larval survival and immigration pulses create rapid increases; the combination of resource depletion, density-dependent mortality, and reduced temperature suitability ends outbreaks.
- Environmental modification: Sea-surface temperature modifies both COTS recruitment and feeding activity; larval immigration provides episodic external inputs.
- Numerical robustness: All transitions are smooth (no hard cutoffs), small constants prevent division by zero, and soft penalties keep parameters within biologically reasonable ranges.
- Observation model: Lognormal errors for strictly positive observations (COTS density and coral percent cover), with fixed minimum standard deviations for stability.

Intended use: Calibrate with time series of COTS density, coral cover, SST, and larval immigration; then forecast outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration under scenarios of temperature and immigration.
