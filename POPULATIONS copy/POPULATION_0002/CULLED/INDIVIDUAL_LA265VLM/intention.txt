Assessment and rationale for model update (COTS outbreak dynamics)

Fit evaluation
- Residuals status: A residuals file was referenced but not provided here. Pending its review, this assessment is qualitative.
- Current likelihood structure uses all observations (COTS lognormal; coral logit-normal with SD floors). This is appropriate and numerically stable.
- Process model avoids data leakage by using predicted states after initialization from t=0 data, which is correct.

Alignment with project context
- The model includes key mechanisms for boom-bust cycles: fecundity dependent on coral food (with preference), temperature effects on larvae and coral growth, adult survival modulated by food, Allee-like reproduction gating, density dependence (Ricker), predation on coral with saturating Type-II/III response, and bleaching-driven coral mortality.
- However, episodic outbreak timing in GBR is often driven by sequences of favorable recruitment years (e.g., environmental windows), not just a single good year. A single-year maturation pathway may under-represent the temporal memory needed to reproduce the observed multi-year build-up to outbreaks.

Potential oversimplifications / missing processes
- No explicit multi-cohort or juvenile stage: recruitment enters adults after 1 year only. This can produce growth but may miss the delayed, pulse-accumulation dynamics characteristic of COTS outbreaks.
- Environmental drivers of larval survival currently use only SST; nutrient/Chl-a/runoff effects are absent (data-dependent to add).
- Additional feedbacks (e.g., cannibalism, predator dynamics, multi-prey switching) are simplified into a single Ricker term and Hill predation on coral, which is acceptable for a first-order model.

Parameters review
- log_q_pred ~ 0.693 (q≈2) enables Type-III predation response; consistent with saturating, refuge-at-low-prey behavior.
- Thermal performance parameters and bounds are reasonable and include soft penalties.
- Allee gate and food-dependent adult survival reflect literature patterns.
- No immediate parameter inconsistencies were found that would force a change in functional form, but the single-year maturation pathway likely limits outbreak timing realism.

Chosen improvement: two-path maturation delay (environmental modifier with memory)
- Motivation: Outbreaks often require more than one favorable year; a portion of recruits maturing after two years adds realistic lag and can better match boom-bust timing and duration without new data inputs.
- Implementation:
  - Total maturation fraction within ≤2 years μ_tot ∈ (0,1) (parameter logit_mu_adult).
  - Fraction of recruits maturing after 2 years f_delay ∈ (0,1) (new parameter logit_frac_delay).
  - Adult dynamics: C_{t+1} = sA_t*C_t + μ_tot [ (1 - f_delay) L_t + f_delay L_{t-1} ], with L_{-1}=0.
- Expected effects:
  - Requires sequences of good recruitment years to build adult numbers, promoting episodic outbreaks and more realistic oscillatory dynamics.
  - Maintains parsimony (adds one parameter) and preserves identifiability by leveraging the time series.

Notes and compliance
- No current-step observations are used in prediction updates; only previous predicted states and forcings (SST, immigration) are used.
- If residuals indicate remaining misfit (e.g., phase or amplitude), consider subsequently adding an environmental multi-year filter on larval survival (e.g., weighted geometric mean of EnvLarv over 2–3 years) or a runoff/chl-a covariate when data are available.
