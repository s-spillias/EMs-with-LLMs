Purpose: Predict episodic boom–bust outbreaks of adult Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef while jointly modeling impacts on and recovery of two coral groups: fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites. The model is designed for annual prediction given initial conditions and environmental/immigration forcing.

Core ecological functioning:
- COTS–coral feedback loop: Adult COTS consume coral (preferentially Acropora), which depresses coral cover. Reduced coral cover then lowers COTS recruitment via food limitation, ultimately collapsing outbreaks (negative feedback).
- Outbreak triggers: (1) Exogenous larval immigration pulses, and (2) favorable environmental conditions (sea surface temperature, SST) that increase larval survival. A smooth Allee-like gate requires a minimal adult density for strong reproductive output.
- Coral dynamics: Each coral group grows logistically toward a shared substrate carrying capacity, with SST-modified growth (dome-shaped thermal performance), background mortality, bleaching-related mortality (smooth threshold), and COTS predation described by a saturating functional response.
- COTS dynamics: Adults survive from year to year with food-dependent survival; new adults arise from last-year larval production (fecundity × food availability × SST-dependent larval survival × density dependence) plus exogenous larval immigration that matures into the adult class with a maturation fraction.
- Resource limitation and nonlinearity: Multiple saturating functions are used for predation, food-limited fecundity, and thermal performance; smooth logistic “thresholds” prevent hard cutoffs. Parameter penalties keep estimates within biologically reasonable ranges without hard bounds.
- Observations and likelihood: Adult COTS (positive densities) use a lognormal observation model. Coral cover (percent) is modeled as a logit-normal process by operating on fractional cover (0–1) with minimum SD floors for stability. Initial conditions are set from the first observed year for each state variable.

Intended use:
- Forecast COTS outbreaks (timing, magnitude, duration) and coral trajectories under various SST and immigration scenarios.
- Diagnose drivers via reported intermediate quantities (e.g., food limitation, larval production, predation pressure).
