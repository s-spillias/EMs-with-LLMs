Assessment of current model (without residuals file)
- Fit: Without the residuals file, I cannot quantify fit. In similar outbreak models, two common patterns arise: (i) coral recovery is too fast after large losses, producing positive coral residuals immediately post-disturbance and (ii) COTS declines are too gradual, producing adult overprediction in bust phases.
- Alignment to project context: The model already includes key outbreak mechanisms: food limitation, temperature-modulated adult mortality, Allee effects, density-dependent reproduction, juvenile stage with density-dependent survival, and SST anomaly pulses. These support boom-bust cycles. However, rapid substrate re-availability after coral mortality likely shortens busts and smooths pulses, undercutting episodicity.
- Potentially missing/oversimplified processes:
  1) Substrate “memory” (rubble/stabilization) that blocks immediate coral regrowth after mortality (predation/bleaching). Empirically, rubble stabilizes over 1–3 years, delaying recruitment.
  2) Environmental modulation of maturation/survival in juveniles (food/temperature). This is a future candidate, but juvenile density dependence is already included.
  3) External nutrient/runoff pulses that raise larval survival; currently approximated by SST anomaly pulses only.

Chosen improvement: Add a rubble/stabilization state R_t
- Rationale: After mass predation/bleaching, dead coral becomes unstable rubble that occludes settlement. This delays coral rebound, reduces food availability for COTS for several years, and sharpens/shortens adult peaks while deepening/lengthening busts—more consistent with observed episodic outbreaks on the GBR.
- Mathematical form:
  • Coral dynamics now crowd against live coral plus rubble:
      crowd_t = (F_t + S_t + R_t) / K_tot
      F_{t+1} = F_t + r_F(T_t) F_t (1 - crowd_t) - m_F F_t - M_bleach(T_t) F_t - Cons_F
      S_{t+1} = S_t + r_S(T_t) S_t (1 - crowd_t) - m_S S_t - M_bleach(T_t) S_t - Cons_S
  • Rubble increases with explicit mortality components and decays exponentially:
      loss_F_t = m_F F_t + M_bleach(T_t) F_t + Cons_F
      loss_S_t = m_S S_t + M_bleach(T_t) S_t + Cons_S
      R_{t+1} = e^{-k_rub} R_t + rho_rub (loss_F_t + loss_S_t)
  • Food index remains based on live coral (F_t, S_t), since rubble is not edible and only occupies substrate.
- Parameters added:
  • log_k_rub (year^-1, log): rubble decay rate; prior guess corresponds to ~2-year half-life.
  • logit_rho_rub (logit): fraction of dead coral becoming rubble (0–1).
  • log_rubble_init: initial rubble cover.
- Expected residual improvements:
  • Reduce positive coral residuals in early recovery periods.
  • Increase negative COTS residuals immediately after large warm/predation events (sharper bust).
  • Improve outbreak intermittency by introducing multi-year substrate memory.

Notes on other parameters (structure retained)
- Temperature-driven adult mortality (M_temp) already helps truncate warm-year peaks and was retained.
- Juvenile density dependence (k_can) retained; could later be extended with environmental modulation if residuals suggest.
- Predation functional response (Hill) retained; no evidence here to justify additional complexity (e.g., switching preference).

Next steps on receiving residuals
- Validate whether early-recovery coral residuals are positive and bust-phase COTS residuals are positive. If so, the rubble mechanism should directly address those.
- If residuals instead indicate mis-timed peaks, consider environment-dependent maturation (mJ(T,Food)) as a follow-up modification.
