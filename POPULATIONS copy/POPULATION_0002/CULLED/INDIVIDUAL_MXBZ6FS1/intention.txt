Assessment of current model and rationale for changes

1) How well the model fits the data
- The residuals file was not available in the chat, so I cannot quantitatively assess fit, autocorrelation, or bias. Please share the residuals to validate the effects described below.
- Structurally, the current model should produce boom–bust cycles via:
  • Resource limitation: food_avail and K_eff depend on coral cover.
  • Thermal performance: tpc_gaussian modulates growth with SST.
  • Low-density limitation: smooth Allee effect on r_C.
  • A one-year juvenile lag (juv_surv) to delay adult recruitment.

Nonetheless, for GBR COTS, adult outbreaks commonly lag one or more years behind larval/settlement pulses. A single-year lag can compress the recruitment pulse into adults too quickly, leading to timing mismatches (e.g., predicted adult peaks may occur earlier than observed).

2) Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model captures selective predation on fast (Acropora) vs. slow corals, carries resource limitation for COTS via coral cover, and includes temperature effects.
- It directly models immigration and juvenile-to-adult recruitment. This is on target for producing characteristic boom–bust dynamics.
- Key context gap: juvenile maturation often spans multiple years, providing delayed density dependence essential for the timing and duration of adult outbreaks.

3) Missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Multi-year juvenile maturation (two or more years) is not represented. The current one-year lag likely underestimates the time to adult outbreak, and may damp or misplace the outbreak peaks.
- Environmental modulation of larval survival beyond temperature (e.g., nutrient/runoff pulses) is absent. Without a nutrient driver in the current inputs, adding a proxy would be speculative.
- Coral refuge at low cover (e.g., shelter/structural refuge) and explicit ratio-dependent predation are not modeled. These may be secondary to the timing issue addressed here, and can be revisited after evaluating residuals.

Chosen improvement: Two-stage juvenile pipeline (two-year lag)
- Ecological reasoning: Juveniles often require 2+ years to reach the large sizes of outbreaking adults. A two-stage juvenile pipeline introduces additional delayed density dependence. This delay helps align predicted adult peaks with observed outbreak timing and can broaden outbreaks’ duration, matching GBR dynamics.
- Mathematical form:
  • Replace the single juvenile pool (juv_prev) with two cohorts: juv0 (settled in the current year) and juv1 (one-year-old juveniles).
  • Adults recruited in year t come from the one-year-old cohort (juv1) that matures with rate juv_surv2. The zero-year-old cohort (juv0) transitions to juv1 with survival juv_surv1.
  • This adds only one extra state and one new parameter, preserving parsimony while creating a stronger, ecologically grounded internal delay.

Parameter considerations
- Added parameters:
  • juv_surv1: survival/transition from settled juveniles (age 0) to one-year-old juveniles.
  • juv_surv2: survival-to-adult from one-year-old juveniles.
  Both are bounded in [0,1] and directly interpretable.
- Adjusted bounds:
  • m_C now has relaxed bounds (0–5 year^-1) to avoid effectively fixing mortality via metadata bounds. This aligns the metadata with the code’s soft-bound penalties and allows the data to inform adult mortality.

Notes and next steps
- After you provide the residuals, we should check:
  • Whether adult peaks shift later and better match observations.
  • Residual autocorrelation reduction in COTS series due to improved delay structure.
  • Whether further refinements (e.g., nutrient pulse modifier on settlement, low-coral refuge in predation, or ratio-dependent feeding) are warranted.

Change summary
- Introduced a two-stage juvenile maturation pipeline with parameters juv_surv1 and juv_surv2.
- Removed the single juv_surv parameter from the model.
- Relaxed m_C penalty bounds in code and metadata to 0–5 year^-1.

Data integrity
- The process model uses only lagged (t-1) states and exogenous drivers, avoiding any data leakage from observed t-values into the prediction step.
