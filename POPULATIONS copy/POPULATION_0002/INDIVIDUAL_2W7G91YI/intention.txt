Assessment and rationale for improvement

1) Model-data fit
- I did not find a residuals file in the provided files for this individual. Without the residuals, I cannot quantify misfit, but in models of COTS outbreaks of this form, typical issues include:
  - Underestimation of peak outbreak magnitude (positive residuals during peaks).
  - Timing mismatches in outbreak onset and decline (phase-shifted residuals).
  - Overly smooth dynamics that fail to reproduce sharp boom-bust transitions (autocorrelated residuals).

Please share the residuals file if available so I can verify these patterns and refine the diagnosis.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- The current model captures many key mechanisms:
  - Adult predation on corals with saturating consumption and diet preference.
  - Food limitation of reproduction via coral cover.
  - Temperature effects on larval survival and coral growth.
  - Bleaching-induced mortality on corals.
  - Density dependence in reproduction (Ricker term) and an adult Allee-type gate.
  - Exogenous larval immigration.
- However, COTS outbreak dynamics are strongly shaped by age/stage structure: juveniles can remain cryptic for 1–3 years before recruiting to the visible adult population, and this delay is central to reproducing the timing and duration of outbreaks. The current model allows larvae to become adults within one time step, which tends to produce responses that are too rapid and may not reproduce characteristic cohort-driven pulses.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Stage structure and maturation delay: The single-equation maturation (L_t -> adults) omits a juvenile pool that accumulates cohorts and introduces realistic lags. This is a key mechanism for episodic recruitment pulses and the boom-bust timing.
- Larval food/nutrient pulses (e.g., runoff-driven phytoplankton) are not represented due to missing data inputs; this is another known trigger, but adding it would require additional data vectors.
- Predation on COTS (natural enemies) is not explicitly modeled; current density dependence may partly proxy this, but more structure would add parameters without guaranteed identifiability from current inputs.

Parameter review
- Topt_larv has updated bounds from literature. This does not require a structural change by itself.
- Other parameters have plausible ranges and soft penalties; predation shape q_pred > 0 allows Type II–III flexibility.

Chosen improvement: Add an explicit juvenile stage (J) with 2-step maturation
- Ecological justification:
  - COTS typically require ~2–3 years to reach detectable adult sizes. A juvenile pool that accrues recruits and then graduates to adults creates realistic cohort pulses and boom-bust dynamics without using current observations in predictions.
  - This directly addresses timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events in the PROJECT CONTEXT by introducing a mechanistic time lag and a stock of “hidden” juveniles.
- Mathematical implementation (annual time step, t indexes Year):
  - Larval production (unchanged):
      L_t = phi * C_t * Food_t * EnvLarv_t * exp(-beta * C_t) * A_gate_t + k_imm * cotsimm_dat(t)
  - New juvenile state:
      J_{t+1} = sJ_t * J_t + L_t
    where sJ_t = exp(-mJ) * EnvLarv_t (0..1), so juvenile annual survival is reduced by suboptimal temperature in the same way larvae are.
  - Adult update (modified):
      C_{t+1} = sA_t * C_t + mu_adult * J_t
    This replaces the previous direct addition mu_adult * L_t to adults.
- Parameters added:
  - log_mJ: log baseline juvenile mortality rate (year^-1). Survival per year = exp(-mJ) in optimal conditions.
  - log_J0: log initial juvenile density (indiv m^-2) at t=0, estimated to initialize the hidden state without data leakage.
- Conservatism in complexity:
  - We reuse existing thermal performance for larvae (Topt_larv, log_Tsd_larv) to modulate juvenile survival, avoiding new environmental parameters.
  - No new data vectors are required.

Expected effects on fit and dynamics
- Provides delayed cohort accumulation and release, sharpening pulses in adult abundance and improving alignment of outbreak timing and duration.
- Reduces the tendency for immediate adult surges following favorable conditions, which should mitigate phase errors observed in typical residual patterns.

Notes
- No current-step observations are used in predictions; all state updates depend on previous states and exogenous forcings.
- Please provide the residuals file so we can verify whether adding the juvenile stage resolves observed misfit patterns (e.g., peak underestimation or timing lags) and determine if further refinements (e.g., nutrient pulse proxy) are warranted.
