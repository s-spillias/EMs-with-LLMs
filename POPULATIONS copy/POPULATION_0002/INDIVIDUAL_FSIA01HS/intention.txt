Assessment of current model and rationale for improvement

1) Fit to data
- The residuals file was not provided, so I cannot quantitatively evaluate fit or patterns (bias, autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity). Please share residuals to enable a targeted diagnostic review.
- Structurally, the model uses lognormal errors for COTS and Gaussian errors for coral cover, with soft penalties for biological bounds. This is reasonable, but the evaluation of fit quality requires residuals.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT (episodic COTS outbreaks and coral-selective predation)
Strengths:
- Includes an Allee-like term for COTS (rC_allee), temperature performance (TPC), and resource limitation (food_avail, starvation mortality).
- Coral predation is selective via separate attack rates on fast and slow corals, with Type-III intensity modulated by COTS density.
- Incorporates a one-year juvenile lag, supporting delayed dynamics necessary for boom-bust cycles.

Limitations:
- Juvenile production depended on coral predation (rec_from_food = gamma_A*pred_A + gamma_S*pred_S), which is biologically indirect. COTS fecundity is primarily driven by adult density and environmental conditions (e.g., conditions favorable to larval survival), not by how much coral is consumed.
- This coupling risks double counting recruitment drivers because adult COTS also grow via an exponential term (r_C component). It can blur interpretation of processes and make outbreak timing less responsive to the biology of broadcast spawning.
- Parameter bound mismatches in model.cpp vs parameters.json (notably m_C and Topt_C) could pull optimization into ecologically inconsistent regions.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Environmental drivers of larval survival (e.g., nutrient-driven phytoplankton blooms) are not explicitly modeled. SST is included via TPC, but nutrients/river discharge are not.
- Stage structure is simplified: adults get both exponential growth and an additional lagged recruitment input; a fully stage-structured model (adults survive + lagged juvenile maturation only) would be more mechanistic but is a larger change.
- Prey-switching dependence on prey availability is simplified; the current “Type-III” response is a function of predator density, not prey density per se.
- Predator control on COTS (e.g., Triton, fish) is not included.

Parameter review and consistency
- m_C in parameters.json is effectively fixed at 2.56 (lower == upper). model.cpp previously allowed 0.0–2.0, which conflicts. I aligned model.cpp soft-penalties to the json range to avoid inconsistent inference.
- Topt_C bounds in parameters.json are 28.0–29.0, whereas model.cpp allowed 24.0–32.0. I aligned model.cpp to the json range.
- gamma_A and gamma_S appear to be placeholders that proxy reproduction via predation. Given literature on broadcast spawning, I propose shifting juvenile production to depend on adult density and temperature, not on coral consumption.

Chosen improvement (one meaningful ecological change)
- Replace the juvenile production dependency on coral predation with a density- and temperature-dependent fecundity term driven by adult COTS and an Allee effect.
- New parameter: rho_fec (year^-1), a fecundity-to-settlement efficiency scaling adult density into settled juvenile cohort.
- Rationale: COTS are broadcast spawners; mating success and larval supply are strongly density dependent (positive density dependence at low densities) and environmentally modulated. This provides a clearer mechanism for rapid outbreak onset once adult density crosses a threshold, consistent with observed boom dynamics, while avoiding double counting via coral-consumption-based recruitment.

Mathematical changes
- Old juvenile production:
  J_new,t = gamma_A * pred_A,t + gamma_S * pred_S,t + imm_surv * IMM_{t-1}
- New juvenile production (chosen improvement):
  J_new,t = rho_fec * (C_{t-1} / (C_{t-1} + Alee_C)) * C_{t-1} * TPC_t + imm_surv * IMM_{t-1}
  Where TPC_t = exp(-0.5 * ((SST_{t-1} - Topt_C) / sigma_T_C)^2) (already in the model).
  Interpretation: adult density produces larvae; positive density dependence is captured by the Allee ratio; TPC modulates reproductive success. Units of rho_fec ensure J_new,t is in indiv m^-2 year^-1.

- Adult dynamics remain:
  C_t = softplus( C_{t-1} * exp(rC_allee,t * TPC_t * Food_t * (1 - C_{t-1}/K_eff,t) - m_C*(1 + starvation_scale*(1 - Food_t))) + juv_surv * J_{t-1} )
  This preserves the previous adult survival/growth structure while making the recruitment pathway mechanistically linked to adult density rather than coral consumption.

- Parameter bound consistency fixes:
  - m_C bounds in model.cpp now match parameters.json (2.56–2.56000000256).
  - Topt_C bounds in model.cpp now match parameters.json (28.0–29.0).

Why this change helps the PROJECT CONTEXT
- Outbreak timing becomes more sensitive to crossing an adult density threshold (Allee) under favorable temperatures (TPC), which can generate sharp increases (booms), while resource limitation/starvation drives subsequent collapse (busts).
- Decoupling juvenile production from coral consumption prevents unrealistic feedbacks that could dampen or mistime outbreaks.

Future data-informed extensions (not implemented here)
- If nutrient/river discharge or chlorophyll data are available, introduce a larval survival modifier to J_new,t for episodic pulses.
- Consider a more explicit two-stage model where adult abundance is driven by survival and lagged maturation only (removing the within-year exponential adult “growth” term), if data support it.

Please provide the residuals to validate whether this change reduces autocorrelation and better captures outbreak onset/magnitude.
