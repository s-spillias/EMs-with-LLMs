Assessment and rationale for improvement

1) Model fit evaluation
- The residuals file was not provided in this chat, so I cannot quantify fit. Based on structure, the model likely captures general trends but may mis-time outbreak peaks and under/over-estimate their magnitude. A key structural reason is that recruitment from food consumption and immigration converts instantly to adults in the same year, which can cause adult peaks to respond too quickly to favorable conditions.

2) Alignment with project context
- The model includes selective predation (Type-III), thermal performance of COTS reproduction, resource limitation via coral cover, and immigration. These are all important for boom-bust dynamics.
- However, realistic outbreak timing on the Great Barrier Reef typically includes a lag from spawning/larval survival to detectable adults, commonly on the order of one year. Without a maturation delay, the model may not reproduce the observed temporal patterns (timing and duration) of outbreak pulses.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Stage structure is absent. Recruitment and immigration directly add to adults with no delay. This omits:
  - The juvenile/post-settlement stage that matures into the adult class.
  - Accumulation of a cohort that can cause abrupt adult increases when it matures.
- Potential additional processes not implemented here (kept for future work): nutrient/runoff pulses modulating larval survival, explicit predator control, multi-year maturation or cannibalism. To keep the model parsimonious and focused on the most impactful improvement for outbreak timing, only a single-lag maturation pipeline is added.

Chosen improvement: one-year maturation delay via a larval/pre-adult pool

Ecological justification
- Outbreaks are often triggered by favorable conditions for spawning and larval survival (e.g., warm years, high food during larval stage), with adult densities peaking after the cohort matures—typically about one year later.
- Introducing a maturation delay allows:
  - Better timing of peaks (lagged response).
  - Larger, sharper adult outbreaks when favorable conditions are sustained, improving boom-bust realism.

Mathematical modifications
- Introduce a state vector larval_pool(t) representing the larvae/pre-adults produced at year t that can mature to adults at t+1.
- Re-interpret imm_surv as survival/settlement fraction into this larval pool (not directly to adults).
- Add new parameter juv_mat_rate in [0,1], the fraction of larval_pool that matures into adults one year later.

Updated process (discrete annual steps)
- Production at t (based on t states):
    rec_from_food_t = gamma_A * pred_A_t + gamma_S * pred_S_t
    larval_prod_t   = rec_from_food_t + imm_surv * IMM_t
    larval_pool(t)  = larval_prod_t
- Adults at t+1:
    matured_{t+1} = juv_mat_rate * larval_pool(t)
    C_{t+1} = softplus( C_t * exp( rC_allee,t * TPC_t * (1 - C_t / K_eff,t) - m_C*(1 + starvation_scale*(1 - Food_t)) )
                        + matured_{t+1} )

Implementation notes
- Initialization: larval_pool(0) is set to imm_surv * cotsimm_dat(0) to avoid using future information and to seed the lagged pipeline.
- No current-year observations enter prediction equations; only prior predicted states are used, preserving the no data leakage requirement.
- Reporting: larval_pool is reported for diagnostics to analyze the contribution and timing of maturation waves.

Parameter review highlights
- m_C is tightly constrained to 2.56 (very narrow bounds), which reduces flexibility in fitting outbreak decay rates; consider widening if justified by data.
- Topt_C is constrained to a narrow window (28–29 °C), reflecting literature; acceptable but may limit thermal modulation variability across sites.
- New parameter juv_mat_rate (0..1) is added with an initial value 0.3. This encapsulates annual maturation/survival from the larval/pre-adult cohort to the observed adult class and is identifiable from outbreak timing.

Expected effect on model behavior
- Peaks in adult COTS densities will lag favorable conditions by ~1 year.
- Outbreak amplitude can increase due to accumulated larval cohorts maturing together.
- Declines remain driven by resource limitation and mortality, preserving bust dynamics.

Next steps after refit
- Re-check residuals for improved timing and magnitude of peaks.
- If peaks are still mis-timed, consider refining maturation (e.g., split 1-year pool into two sub-cohorts or allow a small 2-year carryover), or add environmental modulation of larval survival using available covariates.
