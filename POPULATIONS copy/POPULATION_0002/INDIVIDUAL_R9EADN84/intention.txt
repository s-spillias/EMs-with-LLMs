Assessment of current model and rationale for improvement

1) Model fit to data
- Residuals file not provided in this context, so the following assessment relies on typical patterns observed in COTS outbreak datasets and the current model structure.
- The process model uses lognormal error for COTS and Gaussian errors for coral covers with soft penalties to keep covers within plausible bounds—this is generally appropriate.
- Without an explicit recruitment delay, models like this often struggle with the timing of outbreak peaks: they may either peak too early (immediate response to immigration or predation-derived recruitment) or require unrealistically large per-capita growth to match observed outbreak magnitudes.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model already incorporates key ingredients: Type-III functional response on corals, resource limitation (via food_avail and K_eff), thermal performance for COTS reproduction, bleaching effects on corals, and an Allee effect for COTS.
- However, episodic outbreaks on the GBR are strongly influenced by delayed transitions from cryptic juvenile stages to the visible adult population. Juveniles can persist for ~1–2 years feeding on algal turf/cryptic resources, then rapidly enter the adult class when conditions permit. This delay is essential for realistic boom–bust timing and duration.

3) Potentially missing/oversimplified processes
- Missing recruitment delay/stage structure: Adult numbers jump largely when a pre-existing juvenile cohort matures; immediate conversion of immigration/recruitment to adults can misalign peaks.
- Immigration mapping: Previously, immigration was transformed directly into adults, which is unlikely ecologically—immigrants are larvae that first settle as juveniles.
- Other processes (predator control, disease, multi-year juvenile retention) may matter but would add substantial complexity and identifiability challenges.

Parameter review highlights
- m_C is fixed tightly at 2.56 year^-1 (updated from literature). This high baseline mortality makes sustained adult outbreaks unlikely unless recruitment pulses are strong. This increases the importance of modeling recruitment timing accurately.
- Topt_C bounds (28–29 °C) are tight, focusing thermal modulation to a narrow window—reasonable given literature but it further concentrates growth to specific years.
- imm_surv previously described as converting larval immigration directly to adults; this is inconsistent with a realistic life cycle.

Chosen improvement: One-year juvenile lag for adult recruitment
- Approach: Environmental modifiers of processes with a minimal stage-structure element (single-year lag).
- Implementation: We introduce a single unobserved juvenile cohort that collects (i) predation-derived recruitment and (ii) immigration-derived settlement at year t-1, and a fraction juv_surv of that cohort matures into adults in year t.
- Ecological justification: Captures delayed visibility of outbreaks due to cryptic juvenile phases; allows the model to reproduce the characteristic lag between favorable conditions/larval supply and adult outbreak peaks, improving timing, magnitude, and outbreak duration realism without adding many parameters.
- Complexity tradeoff: Adds one parameter (juv_surv) and one lagged state. This is a modest increase in complexity with high ecological payoff.

Structural and parameter changes made
- New parameter: juv_surv (0–1), the one-year survival-to-adult fraction of the previous year’s juvenile cohort.
- Reinterpreted imm_surv: now maps larval immigration to the settled juvenile cohort (not directly to adults). Adults receive new individuals only via maturation of last year’s juvenile cohort.
- Model equations updated accordingly; adult COTS increment = C_prev * exp(...) + juv_surv * J_prev, where J_prev is last year’s juvenile cohort; J_new = gamma_A * pred_A + gamma_S * pred_S + imm_surv * immigration.

Notes on data usage and leakage
- All process calculations use only t-1 state variables and drivers (including cotsimm_dat and sst_dat). Initial conditions for states at t=0 continue to be set from observations; the unobserved juvenile cohort initializes at zero to avoid information leakage.

Recommendations for subsequent evaluation
- After fitting, inspect residuals for (i) improved outbreak timing alignment, (ii) realistic peak magnitudes without implausible parameter pushes, and (iii) coral cover dynamics consistency.
- If peaks remain mistimed or too persistent, consider (later) extending to a two-year juvenile pipeline or making juv_surv temperature/food-modulated, but this should be introduced only if justified by residual patterns and identifiability diagnostics.
