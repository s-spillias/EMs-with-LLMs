This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton ecosystem, consisting of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z). Phytoplankton growth is limited by nutrient availability, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Zooplankton graze on phytoplankton according to a Holling Type II functional response. Mortality of both phytoplankton and zooplankton, as well as inefficient zooplankton grazing, contributes to the dissolved nutrient pool through remineralization. The model captures the fundamental trophic interactions and nutrient cycling that drive plankton dynamics in the oceanic mixed layer.
