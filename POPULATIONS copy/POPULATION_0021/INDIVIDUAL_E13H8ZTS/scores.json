  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (uptake \u2192 P growth, grazing \u2192 Z growth, recycling to N, mortalities) but differs in several mechanistic details from the TRUTH model. Uptake in the candidate is a standard Michaelis\u2013Menten (Vmax * N/(K_N+N)) multiplied by P (mass-action), whereas TRUTH multiplies the N-limitation by an additional P-dependent light/shading factor a/(b + c*P). Grazing is implemented with the same functional family (Type\u2011III / P^2 saturation) and is the closest structural match to TRUTH. Recycling and mortality processes are present but parameterized differently (candidate uses (1-beta) as unassimilated flux to N and recycles full zooplankton mortality to N; TRUTH uses separate fractions and a mixing term). The candidate also adds a quadratic zooplankton mortality term (density-dependent mortality) that is not in TRUTH. Numerical integration choices (forward Euler, positivity floors) are implementation details, not ecological processes.",
