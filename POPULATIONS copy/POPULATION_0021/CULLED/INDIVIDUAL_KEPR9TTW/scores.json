  "qualitative_description": "The candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) with Holling-type III grazing and lognormal observation errors. Key matches to TRUTH: the grazing functional form (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) and an assimilated grazing term feeding Z are effectively the same as TRUTH's formulation. Main differences: the candidate uses a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (no explicit light/ P-dependent limitation term present in TRUTH) and omits explicit mixing/entrainment terms for N, P, and Z. The candidate also includes an additional quadratic zooplankton mortality term (density-dependent loss) that is not in TRUTH.",
