  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure but differs in some mechanistic details from the TRUTH Python model. Uptake in the candidate is implemented as simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth multiplied by P (V_max * N/(K_N + N) * P), instead of the TRUTH's product of a nutrient saturation term and a separate light limitation term (N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) * P). Grazing is a Type\u2011III (sigmoidal/Holling\u2011III) functional response P^2/(K_P^2+P^2) * Z which matches TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z form (parameter naming differs). Phytoplankton mortality is linear (m_P * P) as in TRUTH, but the candidate omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term in the P equation and omits the N mixing term present in TRUTH. Zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing is present and structurally equivalent (assimilation efficiency * grazing), but zooplankton mortality in the candidate includes both linear and an extra quadratic density\u2011dependent term (m_Z*Z + m_Z_sq*Z^2), whereas TRUTH has only a linear loss q*Z. Observation error and numerical flooring are present in the candidate but are numerical/statistical features, not ecological processes.",
