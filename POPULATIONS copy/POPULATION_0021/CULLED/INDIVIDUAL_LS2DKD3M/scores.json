  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake, grazing, assimilation to zooplankton, and mortality) using standard functional forms from the literature. It uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (no explicit light limitation), a Holling type III grazing function, assimilation efficiency for zooplankton growth, and explicit linear phytoplankton mortality. It diverges from the TRUTH model by omitting the environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient equation and by replacing TRUTH's purely linear zooplankton mortality with a combined linear + quadratic (density-dependent) mortality. Parameter partitioning of grazing/recycling is handled slightly differently (candidate uses beta as assimilation efficiency and recycles (1-beta) to nutrients), and the candidate returns full zooplankton mortality flux to nutrients (no explicit gamma). Numerical details (forward Euler integration, non-negativity flooring, and a log-normal observation model) are present in the candidate but are implementation/numerical choices rather than new ecological state variables.",
