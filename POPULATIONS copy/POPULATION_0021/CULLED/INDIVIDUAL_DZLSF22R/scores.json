  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing transfers, zooplankton growth, mortality and recycling) but uses alternate functional forms for nearly every term compared to the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and P-growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limitation times mass-action in P (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH two-part form (N/(e+N) * a/(b+cP) * P). Grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate (P/(K_P+P) * Z) versus the TRUTH's sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (a Holling III\u2013like form). Recycling in the candidate is split into sloppy-feeding (1-beta)*grazing, explicit excretion (epsilon*Z), and a remineralization term lambda*(mu_P*P + mu_Z*Z^2); these perform the same mass-balance roles as TRUTH\u2019s r*P, beta*lambda_*P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z and gamma*q*Z but with different mechanistic mapping. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term that drives N toward an external N0 (TRUTH's k*(N0-N)) and also omits an explicit P mixing term. The candidate therefore matches ecological roles but mostly as ALTERNATE formulations, with the notable absence of mixing and the presence of an explicit, mortality-independent excretion term.",
