  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure: nutrient uptake drives phytoplankton growth, grazing (Holling type III) transfers biomass to zooplankton, assimilation returns part of grazing to zooplankton growth and the remainder (plus mortality fluxes) recycles to nutrients. Key differences vs the TRUTH model: (1) uptake/growth is implemented as simple Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake multiplied by P (no explicit light/flow factor a/(b+c*P) from TRUTH), (2) there is no explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients of the form k*(N0 - N), and (3) zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic density-dependent term (m_Z_sq * Z^2) not present in TRUTH. Numerically the candidate uses forward Euler and enforces non-negativity with a small epsilon (numerical choices, not ecological processes).",
