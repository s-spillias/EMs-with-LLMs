  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements the canonical NPZ structure (N, P, Z state variables with uptake \u2192 P, grazing \u2192 Z, mortality and recycling back to N). However the functional forms differ from the TRUTH reference: uptake/growth are implemented as a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (V_max * N/(K_N+N) times P) rather than the TRUTH's product of an N-saturation term and a separate light/biomass-modulated term ((N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P))*P). Grazing in the candidate is a Holling II (saturating with P in numerator linear in P) whereas TRUTH uses a sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (type-III/Hill with exponent 2). Phytoplankton linear mortality is present and matches TRUTH's linear loss term, but the candidate omits an explicit physical mixing term for P and omits the mixing/entrainment term for N that exists in TRUTH. The candidate adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term (m_Z_sq * Z^2) that is not in TRUTH and recycles all zooplankton mortality and unassimilated grazing directly to N. Overall: same high-level NPZ processes present, but many functional-form differences (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling-II grazing) and one clear extra ecological process (quadratic Z mortality feeding N).",
