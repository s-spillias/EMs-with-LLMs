  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth \u2192 mortality \u2192 recycling) and so matches the TRUTH model at the level of core flows (grazing functional form, assimilated grazing feeding Z). Key differences: the candidate uses a simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (no explicit light limitation term present in TRUTH), explicitly separates assimilated vs unassimilated grazing and includes both linear and quadratic zooplankton mortality. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations that appears in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P), and uses a Type III (Holling III) grazing which is mathematically the same family as TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) term.",
