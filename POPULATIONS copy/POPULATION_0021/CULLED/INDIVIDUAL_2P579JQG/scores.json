  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake driving phytoplankton growth, Holling type-III grazing transferring biomass to zooplankton, and mortality/recycling back to nutrients. It departs from the TRUTH model primarily by (1) using a plain Michaelis\u2013Menten form for uptake (no explicit light/self-shading term a/(b+cP) present in TRUTH), (2) omitting explicit mixing/entrainment terms for N and P (and Z), and (3) adding a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term. Grazing, phytoplankton linear mortality, and assimilated grazing for zooplankton match the same functional families as TRUTH (Holling-III and linear mortality). The candidate also uses an explicit separation of assimilated vs unassimilated grazing and returns full zooplankton mortality to the nutrient pool (a different parameterization than TRUTH).",
