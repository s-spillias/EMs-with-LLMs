  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with identifiable uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling terms, but it differs from the TRUTH model in important mechanistic details. Uptake in the candidate is a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten form (no explicit light/self-shading term present in TRUTH). Grazing uses a Holling Type III form that is algebraically equivalent to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturation (so grazing and its assimilation are a close match). Phytoplankton mortality is present as a linear loss (matching TRUTH form), but the candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH's dN/dt and dP/dt. Zooplankton mortality in the candidate adds a quadratic (density-dependent) term in addition to linear mortality (an extra component relative to TRUTH). Overall the candidate is a plausible alternate NPZ formulation: it matches TRUTH for grazing/assimilation structure, uses alternate but common Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, and introduces quadratic zooplankton mortality as an extra closure.",
