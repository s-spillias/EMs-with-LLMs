Model Assessment:
The current model implements a standard Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) framework. It uses appropriate functional forms for nutrient uptake (Michaelis-Menten) and zooplankton grazing (Holling Type III). However, a key simplification is the phytoplankton mortality term, which is currently only linear (`m_P * P`). This may limit the model's ability to accurately simulate the full cycle of a phytoplankton bloom, particularly its decline, as it omits crucial density-dependent loss processes. The model for zooplankton mortality already includes a more sophisticated quadratic term, suggesting a similar level of detail could benefit the phytoplankton component.

Proposed Improvement:
Introduce a density-dependent quadratic mortality term for phytoplankton.

Ecological Rationale:
The proposed change is to modify the phytoplankton mortality from a simple linear loss to a combination of linear and quadratic terms: `m_P * P + m_P_sq * P^2`.

This enhancement adds significant ecological realism:
1.  The linear term (`m_P * P`) continues to represent constant, background mortality (e.g., natural cell death).
2.  The new quadratic term (`m_P_sq * P^2`) represents density-dependent loss processes that become dominant at high phytoplankton concentrations. These processes include viral lysis, where viruses spread more rapidly in dense populations, and aggregation-induced sinking, where cells clump together and sink out of the mixed layer more quickly.

This provides a crucial negative feedback mechanism that helps control the magnitude of phytoplankton blooms and can trigger their collapse, better reflecting observed dynamics in natural systems. This change makes the model structure more symmetrical and consistent, as zooplankton mortality already includes a similar density-dependent term.
