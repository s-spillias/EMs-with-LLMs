  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) but uses different formulations for several processes relative to the TRUTH model. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the two-factor form used in TRUTH. Grazing is implemented as a Holling type III (P^2/(K_P^2+P^2)) and the assimilated grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth mapping matches TRUTH's structure. The candidate adds quadratic (density-dependent) mortality for both P and Z (not present in TRUTH) and omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton that TRUTH includes.",
