  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, Holling type II grazing, linear mortalities, assimilation/excretion from grazing, explicit remineralization of mortalities, and a mixing term for nutrients. Many ecological roles in the TRUTH model are present but implemented with different functional forms: uptake and phytoplankton growth are simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten (candidate) vs. the TRUTH's product of nutrient and a P-dependent term; grazing is Holling II (candidate) vs. a sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response (TRUTH). Nutrient mixing is implemented in the same form as TRUTH. The candidate also lacks an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking term present in TRUTH. Non-ecological extras include Euler forward integration for state updates and a lognormal observation model (likelihood) \u2014 these are modeling/implementation choices rather than new ecological processes.",
