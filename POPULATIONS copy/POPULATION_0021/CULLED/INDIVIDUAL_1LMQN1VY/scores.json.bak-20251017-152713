  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, recycling/excretion, and mixing. Many ecological roles in the TRUTH model are present but implemented with different functional forms: uptake and phytoplankton growth use a single Michaelis-Menten nutrient-limited term (no explicit light/self-shading factor), grazing is Holling Type II (TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form i.e. a sigmoidal/Holling-Type-III-like response), recycling is split into explicit excretion and a remineralization term rather than the exact TRUTH algebra, and mixing of nutrients is implemented identically. The candidate omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss term (TRUTH has k*P) and uses Euler time-stepping (discrete update) rather than continuous ODE integration used in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but uses alternate, commonly used functional forms in several places.",

TRUTH supplies recycling via terms like \"(beta * lambda_ * P**2 / (mu**2 + P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z\"; the candidate's split into (1-beta)*grazing and an omega-based remineralization is a different but standard alternative."
