  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth with assimilation, and recycling of losses back to nutrients. Many ecological roles in the TRUTH model are present, but several terms are formulated differently (different functional forms) and one canonical process (environmental mixing/entrainment of nutrients) is missing. The candidate also makes some processes explicit that are not represented the same way in TRUTH (explicit continuous excretion, immediate sloppy-feeding return, and an explicit remineralization multiplier on mortality). Parameter names (e.g. lambda vs lambda_) are used for different processes between implementations, which complicates direct matching.",
