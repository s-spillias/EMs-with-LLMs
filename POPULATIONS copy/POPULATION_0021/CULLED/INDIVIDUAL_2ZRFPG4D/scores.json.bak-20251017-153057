  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, light/self-shading limitation, Holling-type grazing, assimilation to zooplankton growth, recycling from unassimilated grazing and mortalities, and zooplankton mortality. Several components map directly to the TRUTH equations (uptake as f(N)*f(P)*P, Holling-III grazing, assimilation-driven Z growth). Key differences: the candidate omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton present in the TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and -k*P), and it adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term not present in the TRUTH. Parameterizations of similar processes use slightly different algebraic forms (e.g., 1/(1+K_sh*P) vs a/(b+c*P) for light shading), but these are in the same functional families.",
