  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, light/shading limitation, Holling type-III grazing, assimilation to zooplankton, and phytoplankton linear mortality). It departs from the TRUTH model in nutrient recycling partitioning and omits the TRUTH nutrient mixing/entrainment term and the phytoplankton physical loss term. The candidate also adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term that is not present in TRUTH. Parameter names differ (e.g., beta vs alpha) but most functional forms map directly to TRUTH or standard alternates from the literature.",

TRUTH also recycles grazing and mortality but uses a different partitioning (e.g. TRUTH has ' (beta * lambda_ * P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z '), so the candidate implements an alternate recycling structure (unassimilated fraction + mortalities) rather than the exact TRUTH form."
