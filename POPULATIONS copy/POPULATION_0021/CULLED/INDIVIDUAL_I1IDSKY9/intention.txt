This model simulates the dynamics of a marine plankton ecosystem based on the Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) framework. It describes the flow of carbon through the lower trophic levels of the oceanic mixed layer. Key processes include:
1. Nutrient (N) uptake by phytoplankton (P), modeled using a Michaelis-Menten saturating function.
2. Grazing of phytoplankton by zooplankton (Z), described by a Holling Type II functional response.
3. Regeneration of nutrients through several pathways: sloppy feeding and excretion by zooplankton, and bacterial remineralization of dead phytoplankton and zooplankton.
4. Mortality terms for both phytoplankton (linear) and zooplankton (quadratic, representing predation by higher trophic levels).

The model is structured as a system of ordinary differential equations, solved numerically to predict the concentrations of N, P, and Z over time, and is calibrated against observational data.
