  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but differs in functional forms and a missing mixing term. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) with no explicit light limitation term present in TRUTH. Grazing is implemented as a Holling type II (saturating with P/(K_P+P)) multiplied by Z and split into assimilated vs unassimilated fractions via an assimilation efficiency 'beta'. Zooplankton mortality includes both linear and an extra quadratic density-dependent term (m_Z_sq * Z^2) returning to nutrients. The model recycles mortality and unassimilated grazing back to nutrients, but it lacks the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N)) and the TRUTH's Holling-type III grazing (P^2/(mu^2 + P^2)) / light limitation. Overall, most ecological roles are present but some are implemented with alternate functional forms and one extra process (quadratic zooplankton mortality) is added.",
