  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ encodes the canonical ecological roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, and zooplankton growth) but implements some terms differently from the TRUTH reference. Uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Monod/Michaelis-Menten form (alternate to TRUTH's combined N- and P-dependent factor). Grazing is implemented as a Holling type III (structurally equivalent to TRUTH). Zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing matches TRUTH structurally (parameters renamed). Important omissions relative to TRUTH include an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations. The candidate adds an extra process (quadratic density-dependent zooplankton mortality) that is not present in TRUTH.",
