  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ with the canonical roles present (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality; zooplankton growth and mortality). Many terms are implemented with common alternative functional forms relative to the TRUTH model: uptake and phytoplankton growth use a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limitation (v_max * N/(k+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N)*a/(b+cP) form; grazing is Holling type II rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Type III-like) form. Mixing and linear mortalities match the TRUTH structurally. Overall the candidate is ecologically consistent with the TRUTH model but uses simpler/alternate functional forms for several processes (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling II grazing, excretion+remineralization closure).",
