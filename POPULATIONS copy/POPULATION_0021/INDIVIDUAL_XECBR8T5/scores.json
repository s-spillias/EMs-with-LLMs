  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling from mortality/grazing) but uses somewhat different functional forms in some places. Uptake/growth are implemented as a standard Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake times P (alternate to the TRUTH nutrient-limit formulation). Grazing is a Holling Type-III (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) identical in mathematical structure to the TRUTH grazing term and assimilation of grazing into zooplankton growth is present and structurally equivalent. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton that exists in TRUTH. The candidate adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term not present in TRUTH.",
