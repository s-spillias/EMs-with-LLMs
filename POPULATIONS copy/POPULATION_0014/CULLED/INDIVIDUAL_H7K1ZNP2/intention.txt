This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on a coral reef ecosystem composed of two functional groups: fast-growing (e.g., Acropora) and slow-growing (e.g., Faviidae, Porites) corals.

The model aims to capture the characteristic 'boom-bust' cycles of COTS populations. The core dynamics are:
1. COTS population growth is driven by the consumption of both coral types, modeled using a saturating Holling Type II functional response to represent resource limitation.
2. COTS populations are regulated by natural background mortality and density-dependent mortality, which becomes significant during outbreaks.
3. Outbreaks ('booms') are initiated by external larval immigration events, which are supplied as a forcing variable.
4. The two coral groups compete for space, modeled using a Lotka-Volterra competition framework. Their populations grow logistically but are reduced by COTS predation.
5. The decline ('bust') of the COTS population naturally follows the depletion of its coral food source and increased self-regulation at high densities.

The model predicts the temporal evolution of COTS abundance and the cover of both fast- and slow-growing corals, providing insight into the mechanisms that trigger and sustain COTS outbreaks.
