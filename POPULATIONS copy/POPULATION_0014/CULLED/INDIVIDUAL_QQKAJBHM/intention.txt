Model Assessment:
1.  Model Fitness and Structure: The model uses a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (solved via an Euler step) to represent the dynamics of COTS, fast-growing coral, and slow-growing coral. The use of a lognormal likelihood function for observation error is appropriate for population and cover data. The overall structure provides a solid foundation.
2.  Addressing the Project Context: The model successfully incorporates key features like boom-bust dynamics (growth vs. mortality), selective predation on coral types, and an environmental trigger for outbreaks (SST-modulated larval immigration).
3.  Key Oversimplification: The primary simplification is in the outbreak amplification mechanism. The current model assumes that only the success of immigrant larvae is dependent on SST. The local population growth term, representing local reproduction, is independent of temperature. This is ecologically inconsistent, as the survival of locally-produced larvae is a critical factor in the explosive growth phase of an outbreak and is highly dependent on environmental conditions like SST.

Proposed Ecological Improvement:
*   Ecological Rationale: To better capture the explosive, self-sustaining nature of COTS outbreaks, I will introduce a stronger positive feedback by making local reproductive success also dependent on SST. This creates a powerful feedback loop where a growing COTS population's reproductive output is amplified by favorable temperatures, leading to massive local recruitment and rapid population expansion. This aligns with the ecological understanding that outbreaks are sustained and magnified by local spawning events under favorable environmental conditions.
*   Implementation: I will modify the COTS population dynamics in `model.cpp`. The larval supply from both local reproduction (fueled by food intake) and external immigration will be combined into a single larval pool. The success of this entire pool will then be modulated by the existing Gaussian temperature-response function (`temp_effect`). This change ensures that both local and external recruitment are governed by the same realistic environmental constraints.
*   Parameter Changes: This improvement requires no new parameters, instead enhancing ecological realism by restructuring the relationships between existing model components.
