Based on my assessment of the model and the project's goals, I will introduce an explicit starvation mechanism for the Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS). This change will better capture the "bust" phase of their population
cycles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     

                                                                                                  Assessment and Rationale                                                                                                  

 1 Model Fitness and Project Context: The current model establishes the fundamental predator-prey dynamics between COTS and corals. However, it relies on a generic density-dependent mortality term (cots_m2) to induce a  
   population decline. This simplification misses a critical ecological driver: starvation. In the wild, COTS populations crash dramatically after consuming their coral food source. By not explicitly modeling this, the  
   model may fail to accurately reproduce the timing and magnitude of the "bust" phase of an outbreak.                                                                                                                      
 2 Missing Ecological Process: The key missing process is starvation-induced mortality. Linking COTS mortality directly to the availability of coral cover will create a stronger, more realistic feedback loop that governs
   the boom-bust cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 3 Proposed Improvement: I will add a new mortality term to the COTS population dynamics. The rate of this mortality will be inversely proportional to the total available coral cover. When coral is abundant, this effect 
   is negligible. As coral is depleted, the starvation mortality rate will rise, causing a sharp decline in the COTS population. This requires adding two new parameters:                                                   
    • cots_s_rate: The maximum mortality rate from starvation.                                                                                                                                                              
    • cots_s_thresh: The coral cover threshold below which starvation effects become significant.                                                                                                                           

This change directly addresses the project's need to model the full, episodic nature of COTS outbreaks by introducing a more realistic mechanism for population collapse.

 +The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating COTS-coral dynamics. It incorporates key processes such as selective predation with a Holling Type II functional response, inter-specific competition betwee 
 coral types, and density-dependent mortality for COTS. These components allow the model to capture the general interactions that drive population fluctuations.

 +However, in its current form, the model's ability to reproduce the characteristic "boom-bust" cycles of COTS outbreaks is limited. The "bust" or population crash is primarily driven by a generic density-dependent      
 mortality term (`cots_m2`) and a reduction in population growth as corals are depleted. While these are valid factors, the model lacks an explicit mechanism for starvation-induced mortality, which is a critical driver  
 COTS population crashes after they have decimated their coral food source. This oversimplification may lead to an underestimation of the speed and magnitude of the population decline phase, failing to fully capture the 
 dramatic nature of the bust cycle.

 +A new mortality component will be added to the COTS population equation. The rate of this starvation mortality will be inversely related to the total coral cover. When coral cover is high, this additional mortality wi 
 be negligible. As coral cover is depleted by COTS predation and falls below a critical threshold, the starvation mortality rate will increase, reaching a maximum when corals are virtually absent.
