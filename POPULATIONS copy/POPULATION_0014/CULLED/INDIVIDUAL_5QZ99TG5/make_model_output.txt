Based on my assessment of the model and the project's goals, I will introduce a starvation-induced mortality mechanism for the COTS population. This change will create a stronger feedback loop, more realistically        
simulating the rapid population crash ("bust") that occurs when COTS deplete their coral food source.                                                                                                                       

Here is my detailed plan:                                                                                                                                                                                                   

 1 intention.txt: I will document my assessment of the current model, explaining the rationale for adding a starvation mortality term. I'll describe how this change better captures the boom-bust dynamics central to the  
   project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 2 parameters.json: I will add a new parameter, m_c_starv, which will control the strength of the starvation effect. I will provide an initial value, description, bounds, and justification for this new parameter.        
 3 model.cpp: I will modify the COTS population dynamics equation to include the new starvation mortality term. This term will be inversely proportional to the total coral cover from the previous time step, ensuring that
   COTS mortality increases sharply as their food source disappears.                                                                                                                                                        

These changes will enhance the model's ecological realism by explicitly linking COTS survival to resource availability.

 +The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) dynamics. It incorporates key processes such as a Holling Type II functional response for predation, selective feeding on    
 different coral types, logistic growth for corals with interspecific competition, and density-dependent mortality for COTS. This structure is capable of producing the boom-bust cycles mentioned in the project context,  
 where COTS outbreaks are driven by coral availability and eventually limited by resource depletion and density-dependent effects.

 +While the model includes food limitation through its effect on COTS growth (via the `food_intake` term), the mortality component is less responsive to resource availability. The current COTS mortality is a sum of a    
 constant natural rate (`m_c`) and a linear density-dependent term (`m_c_den * cots_pred`). This may not adequately capture the rapid population crashes that occur when COTS completely decimate their coral food source,  
 leading to widespread starvation. The "bust" phase of the cycle could be more pronounced and more tightly coupled to the state of the coral community.

 +To better capture the full boom-bust cycle, especially the rapid decline phase, I will introduce a starvation-induced mortality term for the COTS population. This change directly addresses the need to model mechanisms 
 that both sustain and terminate outbreaks.

 +The proposed mechanism adds a mortality component that is inversely proportional to the total coral cover from the previous time step.                                                                                    
 +- When coral cover is abundant, this additional mortality is negligible, and COTS population dynamics are governed by the existing growth and mortality terms.                                                            
 +- As the COTS population grows and consumes coral, the declining coral cover causes the starvation mortality term to increase exponentially.                                                                              
 +- This creates a strong, non-linear negative feedback, triggering a rapid COTS population crash once the food resource is depleted below a critical level.
