MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current model's primary weakness in addressing the project context is its reliance on an external data series (`cotsimm_dat`) to drive COTS outbreaks. This prevents the model from endogenously capturing the boom-bust cycle dynamics and the feedback mechanisms that are central to the project's goal of understanding outbreak triggers. The model predicts *what happens if* larvae arrive, but not *why* they arrive based on the system's state.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
I will implement an endogenous stock-recruitment model for COTS. This will replace the external `cotsimm_dat` with a process where the adult COTS population produces the next generation of recruits.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
This change introduces a critical feedback loop where a large adult population can generate a large recruitment event in the following year, potentially triggering an outbreak. I will use a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment function, a well-established ecological model that describes recruitment as a saturating function of the parent stock size. This allows the model to generate its own boom-bust cycles based on the feedback between adult COTS density and subsequent recruitment, which is a core requirement of the project. This is a more realistic representation of COTS life history and a crucial step towards understanding outbreak triggers. Two new parameters, `S_max` (maximum recruitment rate) and `S_50` (spawning stock at 50% of maximum recruitment), will be introduced to control this process.
