Model Assessment:
The current model uses a standard Lotka-Volterra framework for coral competition and a Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation. This captures the basic predator-prey and competitive dynamics. However, it simplifies COTS population dynamics by using linear density-dependent mortality and treating larval immigration as an external data driver. A key missing mechanism for explaining the "boom-bust" cycles and episodic nature of outbreaks is endogenous reproduction dynamics. The model doesn't account for the challenges broadcast spawners like COTS face at low densities, which can keep populations in a low-density state.

Chosen Improvement:
I will introduce a component Allee effect into the COTS population growth model. This reflects the reduced fertilization success of broadcast spawners at low population densities.

Ecological Justification:
At low COTS numbers, the per-capita growth rate will be suppressed, helping to keep the population in a stable, low-density state. If the population surpasses a certain threshold (e.g., through an immigration event from an upstream reef), the per-capita growth rate accelerates, allowing the population to enter the "boom" phase of an outbreak. This change directly addresses the project's goal of modeling "episodic outbreaks" and "boom-bust cycles" by providing an intrinsic mechanism for bistability (low-density vs. outbreak states). The mathematical form `C / (C + A)` is a standard and simple way to represent this process, adding one ecologically meaningful parameter (`allee_A`, the Allee threshold) to describe the density at which reproductive success is half its maximum.
