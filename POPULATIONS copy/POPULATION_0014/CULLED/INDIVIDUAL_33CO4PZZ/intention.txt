### Model Assessment

1.  **Fitness and Structure**: The model uses a standard set of coupled differential equations with a lognormal likelihood, which is a reasonable starting point. However, the core driver of population booms is oversimplified.

2.  **Addressing Project Context**: The model includes predation and coral competition but fails to adequately model the primary mechanism that triggers and sustains COTS outbreaks. The "boom" in the boom-bust cycle is driven by `cotsimm_dat`, an external data input for larval immigration. This prevents the model from endogenously generating an outbreak based on ecological conditions, which is a key requirement of the project.

3.  **Missing Ecological Processes**: The most significant missing process is a realistic representation of COTS reproduction. The current growth term (`cots_pred * e_c * food_intake`) implies that all assimilated energy contributes directly to population growth. A more accurate model would partition this energy, requiring COTS to first meet their own metabolic maintenance costs before allocating surplus energy to reproduction. This threshold effect is a critical non-linearity for triggering population explosions.

### Proposed Ecological Improvement

To address the key missing process, I will introduce a more realistic COTS bioenergetics and reproduction model.

*   **Improvement**: Partition assimilated energy into maintenance costs and reproductive output.
*   **Reasoning**: This change introduces a critical feedback mechanism required for boom-bust dynamics. Reproduction will now only occur when COTS food intake surpasses a specific maintenance threshold (`maint_c`).
    *   **Boom**: When coral is abundant, COTS can easily acquire food above their maintenance needs. This surplus energy is converted into high reproductive output (governed by `phi_c`), causing the population to explode.
    *   **Bust**: As the COTS population grows, it decimates the coral. Food becomes scarce, intake drops below the maintenance threshold, reproduction ceases, and the population crashes due to natural and density-dependent mortality.
*   **Implementation**:
    1.  Introduce two new parameters in `parameters.json`: `maint_c` (the metabolic maintenance cost) and `phi_c` (the efficiency of converting surplus energy into new recruits).
    2.  In `model.cpp`, modify the COTS population equation to calculate surplus energy (`e_c * food_intake - maint_c`) and use that to drive a new reproduction term, replacing the simpler linear growth term. This change fundamentally improves the model's ability to simulate the self-sustaining outbreak dynamics central to the project's goals.
