                                                                                              Assessment of the Current Model                                                                                               

 1 Model Fit: The current model structure, which relies on linear density-dependent mortality (m_c_den), is likely insufficient to capture the rapid population crashes ("busts") that characterize the end of a COTS       
   outbreak. This type of dynamic often requires a stronger, non-linear feedback, especially when a resource is depleted.                                                                                                   
 2 Project Context Alignment: The model includes key elements from the project context, such as selective predation (pref_f) and boom-bust drivers (larval immigration cotsimm_dat for the "boom", density-dependent        
   mortality for the "bust"). However, the "bust" mechanism is oversimplified. A critical factor in COTS population crashes is mass starvation after they have consumed their coral food source. The current mortality term 
   is independent of food availability, which is a significant ecological simplification.                                                                                                                                   
 3 Missing Processes: The most critical missing process is starvation-induced mortality. Linking COTS mortality directly to food scarcity is essential for realistically modeling the complete outbreak cycle, particularly 
   the sharp decline phase.                                                                                                                                                                                                 

                                                                                              Proposed Ecological Improvement                                                                                               

To address this, I will introduce a starvation-induced mortality term for the COTS population. This creates a strong negative feedback: as COTS consume coral, their food source dwindles, leading to increased starvation  
and a subsequent population crash. This mechanism is crucial for accurately simulating the boom-bust dynamics described in the project context.                                                                             

This change involves adding one new parameter, m_s_starv, to represent the maximum mortality rate from starvation, and modifying the COTS population dynamics equation to include this new process.

 +The current model provides a solid foundation for COTS-coral dynamics, incorporating logistic growth for two coral types and a Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation. However, its ability to capture th 
 full "boom-bust" cycle, a key requirement of the project, is limited. The model's primary mechanism for population decline is a linear density-dependent mortality term. This is often insufficient to produce the rapid   
 population crashes observed in COTS outbreaks after they have decimated their coral food source. The key missing ecological process is starvation-induced mortality. The current mortality formulation is independent of   
 food availability, which is unrealistic; a COTS population should experience significantly higher mortality when coral cover is low.

 +To better model the "bust" phase of COTS outbreaks, I will introduce a starvation-induced mortality mechanism. This change directly links COTS survival to the availability of their food source (coral), creating a stro 
 negative feedback loop that is essential for realistic boom-bust dynamics.

 +1.  A new parameter, `m_s_starv`, will be introduced to represent the maximum additional mortality rate experienced by COTS under complete starvation (units: year^-1).

 +3.  Satiation is calculated as the ratio of the current food intake rate to the maximum possible food intake rate (`food_intake / a_c`). When food is abundant, satiation is high, and the starvation mortality term      
 approaches zero. When food is scarce, satiation is low, and the starvation mortality term approaches its maximum value, `m_s_starv`.
