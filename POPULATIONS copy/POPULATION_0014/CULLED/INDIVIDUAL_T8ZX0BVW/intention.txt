Model Assessment:
1.  Data Fit: Without access to residual plots, a definitive assessment is difficult. However, the model structure suggests it can capture the general predator-prey and competitive interactions. The key question is whether it can reproduce the *episodic* nature of COTS outbreaks, which often appear suddenly after long periods of low abundance.
2.  Project Context Alignment: The model addresses selective predation (`pref_f`) and boom-bust cycles (through density-dependent mortality). However, the mechanism for *triggering* outbreaks is limited to an external data stream (`cotsimm_dat`). While larval supply is a valid trigger, the model's dynamics are otherwise independent of environmental variability, which is known to influence COTS outbreaks. The provided but unused Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data is a major clue that this is a desired area for improvement.
3.  Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The most significant oversimplification is the lack of environmental influence on key biological rates. COTS are ectotherms, and their metabolic processes, including feeding and growth, are strongly regulated by water temperature. Ignoring this link misses a critical driver of population dynamics and a potential trigger for outbreaks. The current COTS food intake rate (`a_c`) is a constant, which is ecologically unrealistic.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
To better capture the episodic nature of COTS outbreaks and incorporate a key ecological driver, I will introduce a temperature-dependent COTS feeding rate. This directly addresses the project context's emphasis on "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events" by linking COTS population growth potential to favorable environmental conditions.

Implementation Details:
1.  New Functional Form: The COTS maximum food intake rate will no longer be a constant parameter (`a_c`). Instead, it will be modeled as a Gaussian function of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), a common way to represent a thermal performance curve.
    -   Equation: `a_c_t = a_c * exp(-0.5 * pow((sst_dat(t-1) - T_opt) / T_sd, 2))`
    -   `a_c_t` is the intake rate at a given temperature.
    -   `a_c` is repurposed to be the maximum possible intake rate, achieved at the optimal temperature.
    -   `T_opt` is the new parameter for the optimal feeding temperature.
    -   `T_sd` is the new parameter for the width of the thermal tolerance window.

2.  Parameterization (`parameters.json`):
    -   The description for `a_c` will be updated to reflect its new role as the maximum rate at optimal temperature.
    -   Two new parameters, `T_opt` (Optimal Temperature) and `T_sd` (Thermal Tolerance Width), will be added. These will have ecologically-informed initial values and bounds (e.g., `T_opt` between 24-32Â°C).

3.  Model Code (`model.cpp`):
    -   The new parameters `T_opt` and `T_sd` will be added.
    -   Inside the time-step loop, the temperature-dependent intake rate `a_c_t` will be calculated at each step using the SST from the previous year (`sst_dat(t-1)`).
    -   This dynamic `a_c_t` will be used in the Holling Type II equation for COTS food intake, making the COTS growth term sensitive to environmental conditions.
    -   The model documentation will be updated to reflect this new equation.

This change provides a mechanistic link between environmental conditions and COTS population dynamics, offering a more realistic explanation for the timing and magnitude of outbreaks beyond just larval immigration.
