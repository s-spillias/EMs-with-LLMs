This model describes the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interaction with two key coral groups on the Great Barrier Reef: fast-growing Acropora species and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites species.

The model's core components are:
1. COTS Population: COTS dynamics are driven by consumption of coral, which fuels their population growth. Their population is regulated by natural mortality and supplemented by episodic larval immigration events, a key driver of outbreaks.
2. Coral Predation: COTS predation on corals is modeled using a multi-prey Holling Type II functional response. This captures the saturation of predation rates at high coral densities and allows for differential predation pressure on fast- and slow-growing corals.
3. Coral Community Dynamics: Both fast- and slow-growing coral populations exhibit logistic growth, competing for limited available space on the reef. Their populations are reduced by COTS predation and by temperature-induced bleaching events.
4. Environmental Forcing: The model incorporates the influence of Sea-Surface Temperature (SST) on both COTS and corals. COTS growth is modulated by an optimal temperature window, while high SSTs can trigger coral bleaching, leading to increased mortality.

The model is designed to predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations and the resulting shifts in coral community structure, providing a tool for understanding and forecasting outbreak dynamics.
