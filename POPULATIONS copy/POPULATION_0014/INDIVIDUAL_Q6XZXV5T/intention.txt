This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites) coral communities. The model aims to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks.

COTS population growth is driven by the consumption of coral, modeled using a Holling Type II functional response. This response considers the availability of both fast- and slow-growing corals, weighted by a COTS feeding preference. COTS mortality includes a constant natural rate and a density-dependent component that increases at high population densities, leading to population crashes. Outbreaks can be initiated or amplified by external larval immigration events, which are included as a direct forcing variable.

Fast- and slow-growing coral populations are modeled with logistic growth, limited by their respective carrying capacities and by interspecific competition for space. Coral populations are reduced by COTS predation. The total predation pressure is a function of COTS abundance and their feeding rate, and this pressure is distributed between the two coral types based on COTS preference and the relative abundance of each coral type.

The model is designed to be fitted to time-series data on COTS density, coral cover, and COTS larval immigration to estimate key ecological parameters and predict future ecosystem states. The goal is to accurately reproduce the timing, magnitude, and duration of observed COTS outbreaks and their cascading effects on the coral community.
