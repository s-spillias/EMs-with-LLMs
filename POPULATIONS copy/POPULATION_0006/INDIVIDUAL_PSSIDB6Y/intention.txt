Goal: Predict episodic Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS; Acanthaster cf. solaris) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef and their impacts on coral community composition (fast-growing Acropora vs. slow-growing Faviidae/Porites). The model captures timing, magnitude, and duration of boom–bust cycles by combining (i) temperature- and food-modulated COTS recruitment with Allee and density dependence, (ii) preferential, saturating predation on Acropora, (iii) contrasting coral growth and recruitment dynamics under shared space limitation, and (iv) environmentally mediated bleaching losses.

Ecological functioning:
1) COTS population dynamics:
   - Adults survive from year to year with natural and crowding mortality.
   - New recruits arise via a Ricker-type stock–recruit relationship scaled by (a) food availability (weighted coral cover, with preference for Acropora), (b) temperature suitability (Gaussian thermal performance), and (c) a smooth Allee effect (sigmoid around a critical adult density). Larval immigration adds to recruits.
   - Density dependence and crowding (quadratic mortality) generate busts after booms.

2) Coral dynamics (Acropora “fast” and Faviidae/Porites “slow”):
   - Each coral group grows logistically with different intrinsic rates under a shared space-capacity (reef carrying capacity, percent cover).
   - COTS feed using a multi-prey Holling type II response with explicit handling-time saturation and preference for Acropora, creating selective pressure that shifts community composition during outbreaks.
   - Temperature modulates coral net growth (Gaussian optimum) and adds a smooth bleaching mortality that ramps up above a thermal threshold.

3) Feedbacks and indirect effects:
   - Coral cover (especially Acropora) boosts COTS recruitment by enhancing larval survival/energy (food-dependent reproduction).
   - COTS predation reduces coral cover, which later lowers COTS recruitment (negative feedback), helping terminate outbreaks.
   - Shared space limitation couples the two coral groups; loss of Acropora frees space for slow corals to expand post-outbreak.

Data and prediction:
- Initial conditions are set from the first observations of COTS density and coral covers.
- Forcing includes observed sea-surface temperature and larval immigration.
- Predictions are compared to observations using lognormal likelihoods with minimum standard deviations to ensure numerical stability.
