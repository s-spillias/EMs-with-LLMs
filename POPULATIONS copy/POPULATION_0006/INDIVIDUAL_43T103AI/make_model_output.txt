I have a few clarifying points before proceeding:                                                                                                                                                                               

 • A “residuals file” isn’t present in the provided files. Without it (or any fit summary), I can’t numerically evaluate the fit. I’ll assess structure and parameters, and propose one targeted improvement that supports      
   outbreak timing from ecological theory. If you can share residuals later, I can refine further.

 • Structurally, the likelihood is reasonable: lognormal for adult COTS and Beta for coral covers with minimum floors and precision floors to avoid degenerate fits.

 • Strengths:                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
    • Selective predation via multi-prey Holling Type II with different attack/handling for fast vs slow corals.

    • COTS reproduction modulated by temperature (Gaussian around optimum), food saturation (weighted coral cover), and an Allee effect.

    • Outbreaks are known to lag favorable larval conditions by ~2–3 years (development to adult). The current adult-only model applies reproduction directly to adult numbers without a maturation delay, which makes it harder
      to reproduce the timing and “episodic” nature of outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                               

 3 Potentially missing or oversimplified processes                                                                                                                                                                              

 • Stage structure / maturation delay for COTS (key for generating realistic 2–3-year lags from favorable recruitment to adult outbreaks).                                                                                      
 • K-food effect is linear; could be saturating. But this is minor compared to the maturation delay.                                                                                                                            
 • Adult survival not temperature-dependent (only reproduction is temperature-modified). This is secondary for outbreaks relative to delayed maturation.                                                                        
 • Immigration is exogenous; if the residuals show mismatches, one could later add process noise or environmental drivers to immigration.                                                                                       

Parameter review                                                                                                                                                                                                                

 • All parameters look plausible with sensible soft bounds.                                                                                                                                                                     
 • rC, mC, K0, K_food allow density effects; aF > aS reflects preference for Acropora; wF > wS matches literature.                                                                                                              
 • Bleaching parameters are appropriately bounded with a smooth ramp.                                                                                                                                                           
 • No parameters are flagged as “updated_from_literature: true”, so no incompatibilities are implied yet.                                                                                                                       
 • The main structural shortcoming is not parameter values but the lack of maturation delay.                                                                                                                                    

Chosen improvement: Introduce a fixed 2-year maturation delay for adult recruitment                                                                                                                                             

 • Ecological rationale: COTS reach detectable adult abundances typically 2–3 years after successful larval survival/recruitment pulses (e.g., following nutrient-driven increases in larval food). Incorporating a maturation  
   delay produces realistic lagged, episodic adult booms.                                                                                                                                                                       
 • Mathematical implementation:                                                                                                                                                                                                 
    • Remove the “instantaneous” adult reproduction term.

      where ReLU is a smooth softplus to avoid negative production when C > K.

 • Benefits:

 • Yes. I added a juvenile production buffer and a new parameter p_mat (0..1), and removed the immediate reproduction term from the adult update in favor of delayed maturation inflow.

 +- Structure: The model already includes selective predation (multi-prey Type II), bleaching mortality, coral competition, food- and temperature-modified COTS reproduction with an Allee effect, food-dependent carrying      
 capacity, and immigration.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 +- Gap for project goals: COTS outbreaks typically lag favorable larval conditions by ~2–3 years (development to adulthood). The current adult-only reproduction term applies reproduction instantaneously to adults, which ca 
 miss realistic timing and episodicity of outbreaks.

 +Chosen improvement: Add a fixed 2-year maturation delay for adult recruitment                                                                                                                                                 
 +- Ecological rationale: Empirical studies of COTS on the GBR indicate adult outbreaks emerge 2–3 years after conditions supporting high larval survival/recruitment. A maturation delay is central for reproducing the timing 
 and magnitude of boom-bust dynamics.

 +  - The delay is fixed at 2 years (L=2) to reflect typical maturation times and avoid introducing additional data inputs. If desired later, L can be promoted to a data input or estimated with model selection.              
 +  - All predictors for Jprod and J_matured use only past states and forcings (t-1 and earlier), avoiding any data leakage.
