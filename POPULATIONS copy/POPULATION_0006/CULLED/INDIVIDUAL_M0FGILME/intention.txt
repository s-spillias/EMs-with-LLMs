Assessment (pending residuals file)
- Fit evaluation: The provided residuals file was not included, so I cannot compute or summarize fit statistics here. Please share it to refine this assessment. Based on structure alone, the model should capture general boom–bust behavior via Ricker recruitment (alpha_C, beta_C), Allee effect (k_allee, C_allee), and density-dependent adult mortality (q_C * C). However, in many systems this combination can produce outbreaks that last too long after prey depletion because adult survival does not explicitly depend on food.
- Alignment with project context: The model addresses several core mechanisms: (i) selective predation on Acropora vs. slow corals (multi-prey Holling II), (ii) temperature effects on coral growth and bleaching, and (iii) temperature effects and Allee effects on COTS recruitment. Immigration is also included. This is broadly consistent with known drivers of COTS outbreaks on the GBR.
- Potential gaps/oversimplifications:
  1) Adult COTS survival lacks explicit food limitation. Field evidence suggests adult mortality increases rapidly when coral (especially Acropora) is depleted, leading to sharp bust phases. Currently, food limits recruitment (via F) but not adult survival.
  2) Outbreak triggers are often linked to episodic larval survival pulses (e.g., nutrient/chlorophyll anomalies). Here only SST is included; if nutrient proxies become available, a modifier on recruitment could be added.
  3) Stage structure (explicit juvenile pool) and predator control on COTS are omitted; these may be secondary compared to food-limited adult survival for capturing sharp busts.
  4) Preference is fixed (p_A, p_S) rather than dynamic; this is acceptable for now but could be revisited.

Chosen improvement: Add food-limited adult survival (“starvation”)
- Rationale: To better reproduce the rapid post-outbreak collapses when prey is depleted, adult survival should decline when food availability is low. The current model limits food only in recruitment, which may understate bust intensity/duration.
- Mathematical form:
  - Keep the existing preference-weighted, saturating food index:
    F_t = (p_A * A_t + p_S * S_t) / (K_food + A_t + S_t + eps)
  - Add starvation mortality that scales with the lack of food:
    m_starve_t = m_starve_max * (1 - F_t)
  - Modify adult survival:
    Srv_t = exp( -mu_C - q_C * C_t - m_starve_t )
    C_{t+1} = C_t * Srv_t + R_t
  - Properties: 
    • If coral is abundant (F_t ≈ 1), starvation ≈ 0; survival behaves as before.
    • If coral is depleted (F_t → 0), starvation → m_starve_max, accelerating busts.
  - This retains the existing outbreak trigger mechanisms while strengthening the collapse mechanism tied to prey depletion, consistent with observed GBR dynamics.

Parameter considerations
- mu_C is tightly constrained by literature (2.56 yr^-1). With this fixed baseline, density-only mortality (q_C*C) may not yield sufficiently sharp declines. Introducing m_starve_max allows a biologically grounded, food-dependent mortality channel.
- New parameter:
  - m_starve_max (year^-1): maximum additional mortality when food is virtually absent.
  - Suggested bounds: [0.0, 3.0]. Start value 1.0 yr^-1 as a moderate initial estimate.

Notes
- All prediction steps use only previous-step state variables, avoiding data leakage.
- If residuals reveal other issues (e.g., mis-timed outbreak peaks or magnitude errors), we can additionally tune F’s half-saturation (K_food) or introduce a nutrient proxy on recruitment when data are available.
