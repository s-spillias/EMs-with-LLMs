I have one clarification request before finalizing the assessment: you mentioned a residuals file, but it wasn’t included in the files you provided. Could you share the residuals (or a summary of them)? That will let me     
quantify fit issues and refine the reasoning.                                                                                                                                                                                   

In the meantime, I’ve implemented one ecologically meaningful improvement aligned with the project context: add food-limited adult mortality (“starvation”) for COTS. Ecological rationale: outbreaks should crash sharply when 
prey (especially Acropora) is depleted; the current model limits food only in recruitment, while adult survival only depends on density (mu_C + q_C*C). Adding a resource-dependent mortality term helps produce realistic busts
after depleting preferred coral prey and prevents unrealistically long plateaus.                                                                                                                                                

Summary of what I changed:                                                                                                                                                                                                      

 1 Determined code changes are needed:                                                                                                                                                                                          

 • Yes. I added a new parameter m_starve_max and incorporated a starvation mortality term into adult COTS survival that increases when food availability F is low. This directly links prey depletion to adult mortality,       
   strengthening the bust mechanism without using current-step observations.                                                                                                                                                    

 2 Explanation of changes:                                                                                                                                                                                                      

 • Previously: Srv = exp(-mu_C - q_C*C)                                                                                                                                                                                         
 • Now: Srv = exp(-mu_C - q_CC - m_starve_max(1 - F)), where F is the existing preference-weighted, saturating food index used for recruitment. When A and S are high, F ~ 1 and starvation ≈ 0; when prey is depleted, F → 0   
   and starvation approaches m_starve_max, accelerating declines.                                                                                                                                                               
 • This modification maintains ecological realism and addresses a known driver of outbreak collapse. It also complements the tightly constrained mu_C value, shifting some mortality dynamics from pure density dependence to   
   resource limitation, which is supported by field observations.

 +- Fit evaluation: The provided residuals file was not included, so I cannot compute or summarize fit statistics here. Please share it to refine this assessment. Based on structure alone, the model should capture general   
 boom–bust behavior via Ricker recruitment (alpha_C, beta_C), Allee effect (k_allee, C_allee), and density-dependent adult mortality (q_C * C). However, in many systems this combination can produce outbreaks that last too   
 long after prey depletion because adult survival does not explicitly depend on food.                                                                                                                                           
 +- Alignment with project context: The model addresses several core mechanisms: (i) selective predation on Acropora vs. slow corals (multi-prey Holling II), (ii) temperature effects on coral growth and bleaching, and (iii) 
 temperature effects and Allee effects on COTS recruitment. Immigration is also included. This is broadly consistent with known drivers of COTS outbreaks on the GBR.                                                           
 +- Potential gaps/oversimplifications:                                                                                                                                                                                         
 +  1) Adult COTS survival lacks explicit food limitation. Field evidence suggests adult mortality increases rapidly when coral (especially Acropora) is depleted, leading to sharp bust phases. Currently, food limits         
 recruitment (via F) but not adult survival.                                                                                                                                                                                    
 +  2) Outbreak triggers are often linked to episodic larval survival pulses (e.g., nutrient/chlorophyll anomalies). Here only SST is included; if nutrient proxies become available, a modifier on recruitment could be added. 
 +  3) Stage structure (explicit juvenile pool) and predator control on COTS are omitted; these may be secondary compared to food-limited adult survival for capturing sharp busts.                                             
 +  4) Preference is fixed (p_A, p_S) rather than dynamic; this is acceptable for now but could be revisited.

 +- Rationale: To better reproduce the rapid post-outbreak collapses when prey is depleted, adult survival should decline when food availability is low. The current model limits food only in recruitment, which may understat

I identified a JSON syntax error in parameters.json: the last parameter object (m_starve_max) was truncated, leaving an unterminated string and missing required fields and closing braces. I completed the object with         
appropriate metadata and bounds, and closed the array and file properly.
