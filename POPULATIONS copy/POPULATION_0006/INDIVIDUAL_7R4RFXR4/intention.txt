Assessment and rationale for model improvement

1) Fit to data (based on available information)
- A residuals file was referenced but not provided in this context, so I cannot compute or cite fit metrics or plot patterns directly. The likelihood structure is appropriate and stable: log-normal for COTS abundance (strictly positive) and logit-normal for proportional coral cover, with minimum SD floors to avoid overconfidence. Initialization anchors the states at t=0 using observed values (no leakage beyond t=0).
- Structural identifiability appears reasonable given the number of parameters and the observation models, but the recruitment nonlinearity (Beverton–Holt) may be too weak to reproduce sharp boom-bust cycles solely from parameter tuning, particularly if immigration and SST forcing alone cannot generate strong overcompensation.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths already present:
  - Outbreak triggers: A logistic SST-trigger (k_T, T_thr) multiplicatively boosts larval survival.
  - Resource control: Food-dependent fecundity via a Monod function of fast/slow coral cover (w_fast, w_slow, K_food).
  - Depensation at low density: Smooth Allee effect A/(A + A_Allee).
  - Top–down effects on corals: Multi-prey Type II functional response with preferences (q_fast > q_slow), representing selective predation on Acropora.
  - Coral dynamics: Logistic growth with interspecific competition (alpha_fs, alpha_sf) and bleaching penalty (T_bleach, beta_bleach).
- Gaps for episodic boom-bust dynamics:
  - Overcompensation mechanism is weak. Beverton–Holt saturates recruits but does not produce declines in recruits at high spawner density. This can limit the model’s ability to generate sharp outbreak peaks followed by pronounced declines unless other processes (e.g., food collapse) are extreme or immigration ceases abruptly.
  - Empirical and mechanistic studies suggest strong density-dependent mortality among COTS larvae (e.g., competition for microalgal food, cannibalism/predation within cohorts, limited settlement habitat). A declining per-capita recruit survival at high adult densities is a plausible and important driver of the bust after a boom.

3) Parameters review
- Literature-based values: c_max, q_fast/q_slow, g_fast/g_slow, T_bleach are flagged as from literature and are within plausible ranges for the GBR context. They need not change structurally here.
- Initial estimates (placeholders): r_max, A_Allee, K_A, K_food, m_base, e_conv, imm_eff, and several temperature modifiers are still “initial estimate” and set broadly. Nothing in recent literature would invalidate their functional roles; however, the recruitment saturation form (Beverton–Holt alone) is likely insufficient to capture the strong overcompensation inferred during outbreak collapses.

Chosen single improvement

Ecological mechanism added: Larval density-dependent survival (overcrowding) modulating pre-settlement survival.
- Implementation: Multiply the pre-saturation recruitment term by exp(-phi_dd_larv * A_prev). This represents intensified larval mortality from intra-cohort competition/cannibalism when spawner (adult) density is high. It allows recruitment to increase rapidly from low density (with Allee + SST + food triggers) but decline once adult density becomes very high, enabling sharp boom-bust cycles without requiring extreme shifts in other drivers.
- Placement in life cycle: Applied before Beverton–Holt saturation. Biological justification: crowding among planktonic larvae and pre-settlement processes precede post-settlement density dependence, which the Beverton–Holt term can continue to represent.
- Mathematical form: R_t_pre = r_max * S_env * food_sat * A_allee(A_prev) * A_prev; R_t = R_t_pre * exp(-phi_dd_larv * A_prev); then R_BH = R_t / (1 + A_prev/K_A).
- Advantages:
  - Minimal added complexity (one parameter).
  - Preserves interpretability of K_A as post-settlement saturation.
  - Creates overcompensation necessary for classic boom-bust dynamics consistent with the project goals.
- Constraints: phi_dd_larv ≥ 0 with a practical upper bound so that exp(-phi_dd_larv * A) remains well-scaled over expected adult density ranges.

Notes on data usage
- No current-time observations are used in predictions; only previous-time state values (predictions) and forcings are used, maintaining the no-leakage requirement.

What to check after refit
- Residuals (once available): Expect reduced positive residual autocorrelation during collapse phases and improved timing of peak and post-peak declines in COTS. Also check that coral residuals do not show systematic bias during/after outbreaks (e.g., overly rapid recovery), which might suggest needing additional post-outbreak coral recruitment penalties.
