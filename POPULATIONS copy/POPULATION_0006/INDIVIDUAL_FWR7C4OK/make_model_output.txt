 1 Do we need code changes?                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Yes. To better capture boom–bust dynamics in line with the project context, I propose adding food-limited adult survival for COTS. This introduces a feedback where depleted coral cover reduces COTS survival, sharpening      
outbreak collapses and aligning with ecological evidence that adult COTS survival declines when prey is scarce.                                                                                                                 

 2 Explanation of changes                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 • Rationale: The current model modulates COTS recruitment with food and temperature, but adult survival depends only on baseline mortality and crowding. This can blunt the bust phase after heavy coral consumption.          
   Introducing a resource-limited survival multiplier g_food_surv ∈ [0,1] couples adult COTS persistence to available coral, reinforcing crash dynamics after an outbreak—a key feature in GBR observations.                    
 • Mathematical change: Replace Srv = exp(-mu_C - q_C * C) with Srv = exp(-mu_C - q_C * C) * g_food_surv, where g_food_surv = (F / (F + K_food_surv + eps))^gamma_surv. Here, F is the existing preference-weighted, saturating 
   food index based on previous-year coral cover.                                                                                                                                                                               
 • Parameters added:                                                                                                                                                                                                            
    • K_food_surv (dimensionless): half-saturation for food-limited survival. Lower when survival is sensitive at low food; higher to reduce sensitivity.                                                                       
    • gamma_surv (dimensionless): shape parameter controlling how sharply survival declines at low food.                                                                                                                        
 • Data leakage: No use of current-step observations; all predictors for Srv use t-1 states.
