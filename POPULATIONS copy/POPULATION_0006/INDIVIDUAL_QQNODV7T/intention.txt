Assessment summary

Data fit:
- Residuals file not provided in this context, so the following is based on structural assessment and typical patterns for COTS systems.
- Current structure can produce outbreaks (SST-triggered recruitment via k_T and T_thr, plus immigration) and has mechanisms to limit growth (larval overcrowding phi_dd_larv and Beverton–Holt K_A). Observation models and numerical stabilizers look appropriate and should permit fitting.

Alignment with project context:
- Strengths:
  - Explicit SST trigger on larval survival supports episodic outbreak initiation.
  - Food limitation on fecundity via Monod saturation food_sat(P) links prey availability to reproduction.
  - Larval density dependence and post-settlement saturation allow overcompensation and realistic peak limitation.
  - Multi-prey Type II predation captures selective feeding on fast vs slow coral.
  - Coral growth and bleaching penalty provide environmental constraints on habitat recovery.
- Gap for boom-bust dynamics:
  - Adult survival is currently independent of food (except temperature), i.e., S_A = exp(-m_base*m_T). This can sustain high adult densities even when coral is depleted, impeding realistic busts. Empirically, adult COTS experience starvation and elevated mortality when coral prey decline after outbreaks.

Potential oversimplifications / missing processes:
- No explicit adult starvation/food-limited survival (identified as key feedback to end outbreaks).
- No stage structure or explicit lag from cryptic juveniles (acceptable for now).
- No explicit nutrient/chlorophyll driver of larval survival beyond SST; acceptable if data lacking.
- No predator control or removal process; can be folded into m_base during calibration.

Parameter review:
- Current values look reasonable as initial estimates; c_max is from literature, others are initial estimates with wide bounds. No evidence in this context of updated literature values requiring structural changes besides the missing starvation feedback noted above.
- K_food influences fecundity, but adult survival lacks parallel food dependence; this asymmetry may reduce bust realism.

Chosen single improvement

Add food-limited adult survival:
- Ecological rationale: After coral depletion during an outbreak, adults experience starvation and higher mortality. Introducing a prey-dependent survival multiplier helps capture the crash phase without resorting to arbitrary parameter spikes.
- Mathematical form (previous-step quantities only):
  - P_t-1 = w_fast*F_t-1 + w_slow*S_t-1
  - s_food_surv = P_t-1 / (K_food_surv + P_t-1)
  - S_A,t = exp(-m_base * m_T(t-1)) * s_food_surv^eta_food_surv
- New parameters:
  - K_food_surv: half-saturation constant (proportion 0–1) for the survival modifier; sets coral cover scale for starvation effects.
  - eta_food_surv: dimensionless exponent tuning sensitivity; eta=0 recovers current model; eta>1 increases nonlinearity (more abrupt busts at low food).
- Identifiability considerations: K_food (fecundity) and K_food_surv (survival) are separated by process; still, some correlation is possible. Distinct priors/bounds and independent exponents reduce confounding.
- Expected effects:
  - Preserves outbreak initiation via SST/immigration.
  - Tightens timing and depth of post-peak decline when corals are reduced, improving boom-bust realism.

Notes on implementation:
- Uses only previous-step state and forcings (no data leakage).
- Numerically stabilized with tiny in denominators and softplus for non-negativity.
- Maintains existing likelihoods and observation handling.

Future optional refinements (not implemented):
- Nonlinear temperature-by-food interaction on mortality.
- Weak adult density-dependent mortality independent of food (crowding).
- Stage structure capturing cryptic juveniles and delayed emergence.
