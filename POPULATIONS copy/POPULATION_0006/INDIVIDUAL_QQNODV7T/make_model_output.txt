Here’s my plan and updates:                                                                                                                                                                                                     

 1 Are code changes needed?                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Yes. The current model can produce outbreaks via SST-triggered recruitment and density dependence, but it lacks a mechanism to drive the bust phase when coral prey are depleted. Adding food-limited adult survival tied to    
prey availability will better capture the characteristic boom-bust dynamics central to the project.                                                                                                                             

 2 What changes and why?                                                                                                                                                                                                        

 • Add a food-limited survival multiplier so adult survival decreases when prey (coral cover) is low. This creates a strong negative feedback once starfish deplete corals, supporting realistic outbreak crashes without       
   relying on ad hoc mortality spikes.                                                                                                                                                                                          
 • Implement this via a Monod-like function of total “food” P = w_fastF + w_slowS, using previous-step coral states to avoid data leakage:

 • Add two parameters:

    • eta_food_surv (dimensionless): sensitivity/exponent for strength of starvation effect
