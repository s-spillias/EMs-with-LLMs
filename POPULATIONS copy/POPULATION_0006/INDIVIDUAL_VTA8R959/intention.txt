Objective: Build a dynamic, mechanistic Template Model Builder (TMB) model that predicts episodic Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS; Acanthaster spp.) outbreaks (boom–bust cycles) and their feedbacks on coral communities of the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit attention to timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.

Ecological functioning summary:
- States: Adult COTS density (individuals per m2), fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp., %), slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae/Porites spp., %). These interact through predation and space competition.
- COTS dynamics: Adult abundance advances via survival of existing adults, endogenous recruitment modulated by (i) food availability (weighted by fast vs. slow coral cover), (ii) an Allee effect at low adult densities, (iii) density dependence (Beverton–Holt saturation), and (iv) an environmental larval survival trigger (smooth logistic function of SST). External larval immigration is added as a forcing input.
- Coral dynamics: Each coral group grows logistically with group-specific intrinsic rates and intergroup competition, then loses cover to COTS predation described by a multi-prey Holling type II functional response with selectivity/vulnerability differences between fast and slow corals.
- Environmental modification: SST elevates larval survival via a smooth threshold (outbreak trigger) and reduces coral growth during thermal stress (bleaching) via a smooth exponential penalty. SST can also modulate COTS mortality smoothly.
- Feedbacks: Coral depletion reduces future COTS recruitment (food limitation), and high COTS densities reduce coral cover (top–down control). Competition for space between coral groups indirectly affects predation impact pathways.
- Numerical safeguards: All transitions are smooth (no hard cutoffs), small constants prevent division by zero, parameters are softly bounded with penalties. Observation models use log-normal (COTS) and logit-normal (coral %) likelihoods with minimum standard deviations.

Use-cases: Hindcast/predict outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration under varying SST and larval immigration, while reproducing coupled COTS–coral trajectories and selective predation effects on community composition.
