 +- Based on structure alone, one likely source of systematic misfit is timing: the current model (prior to this change) converts recruits to adults within the same year (no maturation delay). Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS 
 typically require approximately 1–2 years to reach sizes detectable in standard adult surveys. An instantaneous recruit-to-adult pathway tends to produce outbreaks that respond too quickly to reproductive pulses. Typical   
 residual symptom: positive, lag-1 autocorrelation in COTS residuals and a lead–lag mismatch (predicted peaks occurring too early).

 +- Strengths: The model already includes several key mechanisms relevant to boom–bust dynamics:                                                                                                                                
 +  - Positive feedbacks into reproduction via coral food availability (weighted fast/slow corals, Monod saturation).

 +  - Selective, multi-prey Holling II predation on corals and coral competition/growth with bleaching penalty.

 +  - Life-history delay from settlement to adult detectability is missing. This delay is a well-supported mechanism that generates oscillatory, cohort-driven boom–bust cycles and improves outbreak timing realism.           
 +  - Additional known drivers (e.g., nutrient/runoff pulses improving larval survival) are not currently included as forcings. These can be considered later if such data are available.

 +- Missing maturation delay (most impactful for outbreak timing).                                                                                                                                                              
 +- Potentially missing environmental modifiers of larval survival beyond temperature (e.g., nutrients/chl-a), and storm disturbances that reduce coral cover, but these require external forcings not provided here.           
 +- Functional response is Holling II; if residuals indicate overconsumption at low prey, a Type III could be considered later.

 +Chosen improvement: introduce a one-year maturation delay                                                                                                                                                                     
 +- Approach class: Environmental/biological process structure (life-history delay), which effectively acts as an indirect feedback mechanism and a variable efficiency term through time.                                      
 +- Justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 +  - Empirically, COTS juveniles are not immediately detectable as adults; there is a maturation period (≈1 year to several years, depending on growth/food).                                                                  
 +  - A one-year delay is the simplest structural change that adds realistic cohort dynamics and can create outbreak pulses that peak at plausible lags after reproductive triggers (temperature, coral food).                  
 +  - This change avoids adding new parameters (parsimony) by using the existing conversion efficiency (e_conv) as the “recruits-to-adults after one-year” efficiency.                                                          
 +- Mathematical change:                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 +  - Replace the instantaneous addition of recruits to adults with a one-year delay buffer (“carry”).                                                                                                                          
 +  - Specifically, at year t the adult update uses the buffered recruits e_conv*R_BH computed from year t-1 (for t=1, this uses t=0 values). The new buffer for year t+1 is then set to e_conv*R_BH computed from year t.      
 +  - No data leakage occurs: updates use previous-step states/forcings only.

 +  - Outbreak peaks should shift later relative to reproduction pulses, improving timing.
