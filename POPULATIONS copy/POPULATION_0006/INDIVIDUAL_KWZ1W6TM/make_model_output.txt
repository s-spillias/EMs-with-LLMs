I have reviewed the current model structure and parameters.                                                                                                                                                                     

Assessment summary:                                                                                                                                                                                                             

 • Fit to data: I do not see a residuals file in the provided inputs, so I cannot quantify fit. Structurally, the model is sound and likely captures rise-and-crash dynamics qualitatively. However, the adult COTS mortality   
   depends only on temperature, which can fail to trigger strong busts after coral depletion, leading to overly persistent high COTS predictions after peaks.                                                                   
 • Alignment with project context: The model includes selective predation on coral groups, environmental triggers for larval survival via SST, an Allee effect, Beverton–Holt recruitment saturation, coral growth with         
   competition and bleaching, and immigration. This addresses many mechanisms for boom-bust dynamics, but the key starvation feedback from food limitation on adult mortality is missing.                                       
 • Missing/oversimplified processes: The main gap is the lack of food-dependent adult mortality (starvation). Without a mortality increase when coral is scarce, the model may not terminate outbreaks quickly or strongly      
   enough once preferred prey has been reduced.                                                                                                                                                                                 

Chosen improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                             

 • Add a food-dependent mortality multiplier for adult COTS that increases mortality when the coral-derived food index is below a starvation threshold. This implements a key ecological feedback to produce sharp busts after  
   coral depletion and aligns with literature on food-limited COTS survival during/after outbreaks. Mathematically: m_eff = m_T * exp(gamma_starv * softplus(P_starv - P_prev)), where P_prev = w_fastF_prev + w_slowS_prev.    
   Survival becomes S_A,t = exp(-m_base * m_eff). This preserves the existing temperature dependence while adding a smooth, bounded, and identifiable starvation effect. Two new parameters added: P_starv (threshold),         
   gamma_starv (steepness).
