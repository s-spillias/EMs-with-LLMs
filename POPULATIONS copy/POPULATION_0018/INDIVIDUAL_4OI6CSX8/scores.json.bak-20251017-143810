  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth limited by nutrients and light, zooplankton grazing with assimilation, and zooplankton mortality. Many ecological roles from the TRUTH model are present but implemented with alternate functional forms common in the literature (e.g., Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation and Holling Type II grazing rather than the specific P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form in TRUTH). Important missing TRUTH elements: the TRUTH model's explicit mixing/dilution term k*(N0 - N) and an explicit phytoplankton mixing loss (s + k)*P are not represented (candidate uses a constant N_input instead). The candidate also includes several additional ecological processes not in TRUTH: seasonal light forcing with depth-averaged attenuation and self-shading, seasonal temperature forcing with Q10 scaling of rates, and an added quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term.",
