MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a comprehensive NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Seasonal light variation (sinusoidal, amplitude ~40%, peaking day 172)
- Light attenuation with phytoplankton self-shading
- Nutrient limitation (Michaelis-Menten kinetics)
- Temperature dependence via Q10 formulation (Q10_phyto=2.7, Q10_zoo=2.5, Q10_remin=3.0)
- Zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II functional response)
- Nutrient recycling from mortality and inefficient grazing

CRITICAL LIMITATION IDENTIFIED:
The model currently assumes CONSTANT temperature (T_prev = T_ref = 15°C throughout all simulations).
This means all Q10 temperature dependencies are effectively inactive (f_temp = 1.0 always).
This is ecologically unrealistic for temperate/polar ocean systems where seasonal temperature 
variation (5-15°C range) is a major driver of plankton dynamics.

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: SEASONAL TEMPERATURE FORCING ===

RATIONALE:
In temperate and polar oceans, mixed layer temperature varies seasonally by 5-15°C, profoundly 
affecting plankton dynamics:

1. METABOLIC COUPLING: Temperature affects all biological rates (growth, grazing, mortality, 
   remineralization) through Q10 relationships. Currently this machinery exists but is dormant.

2. SEASONAL ASYNCHRONY: Light and temperature don't peak simultaneously:
   - Spring: Light increases (day length) but water is still cold → spring diatom bloom
   - Summer: Both light and temperature peak → different community composition
   - Fall: Light decreases but water still warm → fall bloom in some regions
   - Winter: Both low → minimal productivity

3. BLOOM TIMING: Spring blooms occur when light limitation is relieved but temperature is 
   still low (~5-8°C). Summer blooms occur at higher temperatures (~15-18°C) with different 
   phytoplankton growth rates and zooplankton grazing pressure.

4. TROPHIC MISMATCH: Temperature affects phytoplankton and zooplankton differently (different 
   Q10 values), potentially creating phenological mismatches important for bloom dynamics.

IMPLEMENTATION:
Add seasonal temperature forcing using a sinusoidal function similar to light:
T(t) = T_mean + T_amplitude * sin(2π * (t - t_phase_temp) / 365)

Where:
- T_mean: Annual mean mixed layer temperature (°C) - NEW PARAMETER
- T_amplitude: Amplitude of seasonal temperature variation (°C) - NEW PARAMETER  
- t_phase_temp: Day of year when temperature peaks (days) - NEW PARAMETER

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- T_mean: Represents the geographic location (tropical ~25°C, temperate ~12°C, polar ~2°C)
- T_amplitude: Represents seasonal variability (tropical ~2°C, temperate ~7°C, polar ~4°C)
- t_phase_temp: Temperature typically peaks ~30-60 days AFTER light (thermal inertia of ocean)
  For Northern Hemisphere: ~day 230 (mid-August) vs light peak ~day 172 (June 21)

EXPECTED DYNAMICS:
1. Spring bloom: Light increases (March-April) but T still low → moderate phytoplankton growth,
   low zooplankton grazing (both temperature-limited)
2. Early summer: Light high, T increasing → rapid phytoplankton growth, increasing grazing
3. Late summer: Light decreasing, T at maximum → high grazing pressure may suppress phytoplankton
4. Fall: Both declining → potential fall bloom if nutrients replenished and grazing pressure drops
5. Winter: Both low → minimal activity, nutrient accumulation

PARAMETER BOUNDS:
- T_mean: 0-30°C (covers polar to tropical)
- T_amplitude: 0-15°C (0 = no seasonality/tropical, 15 = extreme seasonality)
- t_phase_temp: 0-365 days (with prior centered at ~230 for Northern Hemisphere)

This improvement activates existing model capabilities (Q10 dependencies) without adding 
complexity to the fundamental equations, while dramatically improving ecological realism 
for temperate and polar ocean systems.
