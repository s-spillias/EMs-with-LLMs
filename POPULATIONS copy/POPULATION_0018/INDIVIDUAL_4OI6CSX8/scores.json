  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling from grazing and mortality, linear mortality terms) but uses different mathematical realizations than the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times a separate light-saturation term (with explicit seasonal light attenuation), rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) times a/(b + c*P) form. Grazing is Holling type II in the candidate (P/(K_P + P)), whereas TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) functional response. The candidate adds several processes not present in TRUTH: explicit seasonal light forcing and depth-averaged self-shading, Q10 temperature modifiers with seasonal temperature forcing, a quadratic zooplankton mortality term, and a constant external nutrient input (N_input) rather than TRUTH's mixing term k*(N0 - N). Several TRUTH terms (mixing/entrainment for N and mixing loss for P and Z) are absent or replaced by different formulations.",
