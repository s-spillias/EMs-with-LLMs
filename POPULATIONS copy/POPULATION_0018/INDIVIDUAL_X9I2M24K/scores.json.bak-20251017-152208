  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with several mechanistic extensions (temperature/Q10 scaling, explicit seasonal light limitation with self-shading, variable assimilation efficiency, and quadratic zooplankton mortality). For core processes it uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation and Holling-type grazing rather than the exact functional forms in the TRUTH model (which used a P-dependent modifier and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Some TRUTH terms (linear phytoplankton mortality) are represented nearly identically (and are functionally identical given the candidate sets T_prev = T_ref so Q10 factors = 1), but the candidate omits a TRUTH-style mixing/dilution term that relaxes nutrients toward a background concentration.",
