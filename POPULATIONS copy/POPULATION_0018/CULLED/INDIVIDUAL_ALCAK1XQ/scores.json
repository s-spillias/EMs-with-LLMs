  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality, zooplankton growth) but with different mathematical choices in several places. Phytoplankton uptake is implemented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit mixed-layer light limitation (Steele formulation) rather than the simpler a/(b + c*P) factor used in TRUTH. Grazing in the candidate is Holling II (P/(K_P+P)) while TRUTH uses a Hill-type (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). Phytoplankton non-grazing mortality matches TRUTH\u2019s linear form. The candidate adds several processes that TRUTH does not have (explicit Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer light averaging with photoinhibition, food-dependent variable assimilation efficiency, and an added quadratic zooplankton mortality term). Notably, the candidate omits explicit mixing/entrainment terms for P and Z and does not implement the TRUTH mixing term k*(N0 - N) (it has only a constant N_input source). Overall: most canonical roles are present but some are implemented as alternates and some TRUTH components (mixing for P/Z and N exchange) are missing.",
