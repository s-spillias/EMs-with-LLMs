  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N uptake \u2192 P growth \u2192 Z growth) but uses different functional forms and extra sub-processes compared with the TRUTH Python NPZ. Nutrient uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten in N multiplied by an explicit light\u2010limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert integrated + Steele photo\u2011inhibition), instead of the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c P)) * P. Grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (a Type\u2011III/sigmoidal form). Recycling from zooplankton is present (both excretion/unassimilated food and mortality) but implemented via (1 - epsilon) * grazing + gamma_Z * mortality rather than the TRUTH's separated beta*\u2026 and gamma*\u2026 terms. The candidate adds explicit light dynamics, a food\u2011dependent (variable) assimilation efficiency, and quadratic zooplankton mortality that are not in the TRUTH model. The candidate also omits the TRUTH mixing/dilution term k*(N0 - N) for nutrients and the P mixing loss (s+k)*P; instead it has a constant N_input term for nutrients.",
