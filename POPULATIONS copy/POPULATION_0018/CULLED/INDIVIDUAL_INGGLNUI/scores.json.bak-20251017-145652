  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard three-compartment NPZ but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH reference. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as simple Michaelis\u2013Menten (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) with no explicit light/self-shading term (the TRUTH model multiplies nutrient uptake by a/(b + c*P) to represent light/self-shading). Grazing is Holling type II (P/(K_P+P)) in the candidate vs a squared Hill-type response (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) in TRUTH. Recycling in the candidate is a single term that returns mortality and unassimilated grazing to nutrients (gamma * (P_mortality + Z_mortality + (1-alpha)*grazing)), whereas TRUTH has several explicit recycling terms (r*P, beta*lambda_*P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z, gamma*q*Z). The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and the mixing loss for phytoplankton present in TRUTH. Zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) in the candidate versus linear in TRUTH. Overall, most canonical processes are present but many are implemented as literature alternates rather than exact matches to TRUTH.",
