MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a comprehensive NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Seasonal light variation (sinusoidal with amplitude and phase parameters)
- Temperature dependence via Q10 formulation for growth, grazing, and remineralization
- Light limitation with self-shading (phytoplankton-dependent attenuation)
- Nutrient limitation via Michaelis-Menten kinetics
- Holling Type II functional response for grazing
- Nutrient recycling from both phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality

Parameter values have been updated from literature searches, particularly:
- I_0_mean: 443 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹ (realistic temperate ocean value)
- Q10_phyto: 2.7 (within typical range for phytoplankton metabolism)
- Q10_zoo: 2.5 (appropriate for zooplankton)
- Q10_remin: 3.0 (higher, reflecting bacterial temperature sensitivity)

=== IDENTIFIED GAP ===

The current model treats phytoplankton mortality (m_P) as constant, independent of physiological state. This oversimplification misses a critical ecological feedback:

ECOLOGICAL REALITY: Nutrient-stressed phytoplankton experience elevated mortality through:
1. Reduced cellular integrity and membrane stability
2. Increased susceptibility to viral lysis
3. Programmed cell death (apoptosis) under prolonged nutrient stress
4. Enhanced aggregation and sinking losses
5. Reduced ability to repair photodamage

CONSEQUENCE: Under nutrient limitation, phytoplankton should die faster, not just grow slower.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

ADDITION: Nutrient-stress-dependent phytoplankton mortality

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
m_P_effective = m_P * f_temp_remin * (1 + m_P_stress * (1 - nutrient_limitation)) * P_prev

Where:
- m_P: baseline mortality rate at reference temperature (existing parameter)
- m_P_stress: stress-induced mortality coefficient (NEW PARAMETER)
- nutrient_limitation: N/(K_N + N) (already calculated in model)
- When nutrients are replete (nutrient_limitation → 1): mortality ≈ m_P
- When nutrients are depleted (nutrient_limitation → 0): mortality ≈ m_P * (1 + m_P_stress)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Creates stabilizing feedback preventing unrealistic phytoplankton accumulation
2. Accelerates nutrient recycling during post-bloom phases
3. Improves representation of bloom-crash dynamics
4. Reflects observed physiological stress responses
5. Simple multiplicative form maintains model tractability

PARAMETER SPECIFICATION:
- m_P_stress: dimensionless coefficient (0-5 range)
  * 0 = no stress effect (current model behavior)
  * 1 = mortality doubles under complete nutrient depletion
  * 2-3 = moderate to strong stress response (ecologically realistic)
  * >5 = extreme stress response (likely unrealistic)
  
Initial value: 2.0 (mortality triples under severe nutrient stress)
Lower bound: 0.0 (no stress effect)
Upper bound: 5.0 (prevents extreme parameter values)

EXPECTED IMPACT:
- Better capture of post-bloom phytoplankton decline
- More realistic nutrient recycling dynamics
- Improved model fit during transition periods
- Enhanced representation of nutrient-phytoplankton feedback loops

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

The modification requires:
1. Adding m_P_stress parameter to parameters.json
2. Modifying EQUATION 8 in model.cpp to include stress-dependent mortality
3. No changes to data inputs or other model structure
4. Maintains backward compatibility (m_P_stress = 0 recovers original model)
