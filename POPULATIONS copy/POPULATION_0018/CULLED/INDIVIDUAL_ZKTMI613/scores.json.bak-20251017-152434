  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from mortality and excretion, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and zooplankton mortality) but uses different functional forms and many added processes compared with the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and growth are represented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit light limitation (with seasonal light, self-shading and mixed-layer averaging) rather than the TRUTH's (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+cP)) form. Grazing is Holling Type II rather than the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH. The candidate includes extra ecological modifiers (temperature Q10 factors, seasonal/vertical light attenuation, nutrient-stress-dependent phytoplankton mortality, and quadratic zooplankton mortality) that are not present in TRUTH. Important omissions/differences: the TRUTH mixing/dilution term k*(N0 - N) and the phytoplankton mixing loss (-(s+k)*P) are not represented in the candidate (candidate instead uses a simple N_input term for nutrients). Overall the candidate matches ecological roles but often as ALTERNATE formulations and also introduces multiple extra processes.",
