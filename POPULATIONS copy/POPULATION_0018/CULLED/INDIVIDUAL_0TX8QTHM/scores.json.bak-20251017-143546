  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with several key formulation differences from the TRUTH Python model. Uptake/growth are implemented as a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient-limited growth (no explicit light / self-shading term present). Grazing is Holling Type II (saturating linear-in-P denominator) instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. Zooplankton growth is assimilation of grazing (present) but zooplankton mortality is density-dependent quadratic in the candidate (TRUTH uses linear mortality). The candidate includes recycling from phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton mortality and an explicit excretion term, but it omits the environmental mixing / dilution term (k*(N0-N)) present in TRUTH. The candidate also contains estimation machinery (priors, observation error, Euler forward integration) which are model-fitting features rather than new ecological state/process components.",
