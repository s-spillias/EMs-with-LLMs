 1 Updated parameter m_Z (zooplankton mortality): The value has been updated from literature to 0.96 day^-1 with bounds [0.1, 1.82]. This is quite high - nearly 100% daily mortality rate - suggesting strong top-down     
   control or predation pressure.                                                                                                                                                                                           
 2 Updated parameter r (phytoplankton growth): Updated to 1.0 day^-1 with tight bounds [0.8, 1.2], indicating well-constrained maximum growth rate.                                                                         

Missing Ecological Process:                                                                                                                                                                                                 

The high zooplankton mortality rate (m_Z = 0.96) suggests significant predation by higher trophic levels, but the current model uses a linear mortality term. In reality, predation on zooplankton typically follows a      
density-dependent pattern - when zooplankton are abundant, they attract more predators (Type II or III functional response). This is a critical ecological process for plankton dynamics.                                   


                                                                                                    Proposed Improvement                                                                                                    

I propose replacing the linear zooplankton mortality with a quadratic (density-dependent) mortality term to represent predation by higher trophic levels. This is ecologically justified because:                           

 1 Predator aggregation: Higher zooplankton densities attract more fish and other predators                                                                                                                                 
 2 Encounter rates: Predation increases non-linearly with prey density                                                                                                                                                      
 3 Stability: Quadratic mortality can stabilize oscillations in NPZ models                                                                                                                                                  
 4 Literature support: Density-dependent zooplankton mortality is well-documented in marine ecosystems                                                                                                                      

The mathematical change: m_Z * Z → m_Z * Z^2                                                                                                                                                                                

This maintains the same parameter but changes its ecological interpretation from a constant per-capita mortality rate to a density-dependent predation coefficient.
