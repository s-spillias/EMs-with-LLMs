  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling from mortality/excretion) but uses different functional forms from the TRUTH model in several places. Uptake/growth use a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient limitation without the TRUTH model's light/self-shading term. Grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) versus Holling-Type-III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) in TRUTH. Phytoplankton mortality is implemented as linear (matching TRUTH's linear mortality term) but the candidate omits the environmental mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH for N and P. Zooplankton mortality is density-dependent (quadratic) rather than the TRUTH linear loss. Recycling is present in the candidate as explicit remineralization from phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton mortality, and excretion (excretion is an explicit fraction of grazing), which maps to but is parameterized differently than the TRUTH recycling terms. Overall: functionally similar ecological roles are present, but several structural differences (absence of mixing, different grazing functional response, quadratic Z mortality, explicit excretion term) make the candidate an alternate formulation in many respects.",
