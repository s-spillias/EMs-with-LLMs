  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake, recycling, grazing, and zooplankton growth, but many functional forms differ from the TRUTH reference. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as Monod (Michaelis-Menten) uptake co-limited by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert attenuation + saturating light response) \u2014 a process absent from the TRUTH. Grazing is Holling type II in the candidate versus a type-III-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) in TRUTH. Zooplankton mortality in the candidate includes an extra quadratic density-dependent term. The candidate also uses a constant nutrient input (N_input) but lacks the TRUTH mixing/dilution term that drives N toward an ambient value (k*(N0 - N)). Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but often as alternates (different functional families); some canonical TRUTH terms (mixing/entrainment as a dilution sink for N and an explicit phytoplankton mixing loss) are missing or implemented differently.",
