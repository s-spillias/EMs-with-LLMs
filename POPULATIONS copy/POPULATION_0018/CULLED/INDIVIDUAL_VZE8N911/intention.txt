ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:

The current NPZ model implements standard plankton dynamics with nutrient limitation (Michaelis-Menten), 
grazing (Holling Type II), and nutrient recycling. However, it is missing a critical process for oceanic 
mixed layer dynamics: light limitation of phytoplankton growth.

KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP:
In the oceanic mixed layer, phytoplankton growth is typically co-limited by both nutrients AND light. 
The current model only considers nutrient limitation, which is unrealistic for surface ocean conditions where:
1. Light availability varies seasonally and with depth
2. Phytoplankton self-shading occurs at high biomass concentrations
3. Light and nutrient co-limitation creates important feedback mechanisms

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add light limitation with self-shading to phytoplankton growth rate. This improvement:

1. ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
   - Phytoplankton require light for photosynthesis
   - High phytoplankton biomass reduces light penetration (self-shading effect)
   - Self-shading creates negative feedback that can prevent unrealistic bloom magnitudes
   - Light-nutrient co-limitation is fundamental to mixed layer plankton dynamics

2. MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Light limitation factor: L = I / (K_I + I)
   - Available light with self-shading: I = I_0 * exp(-k_w * P)
   - Modified growth: r_max * (N/(K_N + N)) * (I/(K_I + I)) * P
   
   Where:
   - I_0 = surface light intensity (dimensionless, relative units)
   - K_I = half-saturation constant for light limitation
   - k_w = light attenuation coefficient due to phytoplankton self-shading

3. EXPECTED EFFECTS:
   - Prevents unrealistic phytoplankton blooms through self-shading feedback
   - Creates more realistic seasonal dynamics if I_0 varies
   - Improves model realism for oceanic mixed layer conditions
   - Adds biologically meaningful constraint on maximum phytoplankton biomass

4. PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
   - I_0: Surface light intensity (0.5-1.5 relative units, baseline ~1.0)
   - K_I: Half-saturation for light (0.1-0.5 relative units)
   - k_w: Self-shading coefficient (0.01-0.5 m^2 (g C)^-1)

This represents a well-established ecological mechanism that significantly improves model realism 
for the oceanic mixed layer context without adding excessive complexity.
