  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements the same basic NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, phytoplankton growth and grazing, zooplankton growth and mortality) but uses different functional forms for several processes and adds explicit light attenuation/self-shading, a sinking loss for phytoplankton, and quadratic zooplankton mortality. Nutrient uptake/growth in the candidate is Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light-limitation factor (alternate to the TRUTH multiplicative form), grazing is a Holling Type II term (alternate to the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form), recycling is represented by excretion + mortality terms (alternate but ecologically equivalent), and the candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/dilution term k*(N0-N) in favor of a simple N_input source term. Several new physical/biological processes (self-shading light averaging, sinking loss, quadratic zooplankton mortality) are present in the candidate and are not in the TRUTH model.",
