  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the same NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, recycling, zooplankton growth and mortality) but using alternative functional forms and extra mechanisms. Uptake/growth are represented as multiplicative Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit light limitation (depth-averaged PAR), grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a quadratic saturating form in TRUTH, and recycling is split into grazing inefficiency plus mortality-driven recycling. The candidate also adds mechanistic sinking, an explicit light-attenuation/mixed-layer calculation, quadratic zooplankton mortality and a simple constant nutrient input term instead of the TRUTH mixing/dilution formulation.",
