  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth; grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth; mortality/recycling terms). However it uses different functional forms in key places: nutrient uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten multiplied by an explicit Steele photoinhibition light function (with mixed-layer averaging and self-shading) rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) form; grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Hill-type form; zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic term. Critically, the candidate does not implement the TRUTH mixing/dilution term k*(N0 - N) that drives nutrients toward a background concentration; instead it has a constant N_input source. Overall many ecological roles are present but via alternate canonical formulations and with two notable extra processes (explicit Steele photoinhibition/self-shading light model and quadratic zooplankton mortality).",
