  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, phytoplankton growth and loss, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and zooplankton mortality) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH implementation. Phytoplankton growth is modelled as co-limited by a Michaelis-Menten nutrient term multiplied by an explicit Steele photoinhibition light function (an alternate light formulation not present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling Type II (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Hill-like response). Nutrient recycling from grazing and zooplankton mortality is present, but the candidate uses a gamma_P/gamma_Z partitioning and (1-epsilon) excretion term rather than the exact TRUTH algebra. Important omissions: the candidate lacks an explicit mixing/entrainment term of the form k*(N0 - N) and does not include an explicit mixing loss for phytoplankton. The model also adds quadratic zooplankton mortality and a detailed light/attenuation module that are not present in TRUTH.",
