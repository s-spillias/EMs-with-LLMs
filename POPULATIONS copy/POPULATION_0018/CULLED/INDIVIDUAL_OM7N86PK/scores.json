  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the standard NPZ ecological roles but uses different mathematical forms for several processes. Uptake is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit, depth-averaged light limitation (an alternate, more mechanistic light formulation versus the TRUTH's a/(b + c P) term). Grazing is Holling type II (candidate) vs a sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH. Phytoplankton non-grazing mortality is the same linear form as TRUTH. Zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) in the candidate whereas TRUTH uses linear mortality. Recycling in the candidate collects mortality and unassimilated grazing into a single recycling term; TRUTH splits recycling across several terms. Importantly, the candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) in dN/dt and the (s + k)*P loss in dP/dt). Implementation-level details (explicit light physics, observation error SDs, soft parameter bounds, Euler integration) are present but are alternate implementations rather than truly new ecological state variables or ecological processes.",
