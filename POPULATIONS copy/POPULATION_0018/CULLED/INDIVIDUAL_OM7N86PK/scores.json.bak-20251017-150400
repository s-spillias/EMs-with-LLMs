  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with several structural differences from the TRUTH Python model. Both models include nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, recycling, and zooplankton growth via assimilation. The candidate uses a classical Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term multiplied by an explicit depth-averaged light limitation (L_avg -> L_lim) instead of the TRUTH's P-dependent attenuation term a/(b + c*P). Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) while TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form. Phytoplankton mortality in the candidate is linear (matches TRUTH's linear losses), but the candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N) and the (s+k)*P term) and replaces TRUTH's linear zooplankton mortality with quadratic density-dependent mortality. The candidate also includes an explicit light-attenuation / depth-averaged irradiance module (I_0, k_w, k_c, H, I_sat), which is an ecological process not present in the TRUTH code. Overall the candidate maps to many canonical components but some are alternate formulations and mixing is missing.",
