  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from phytoplankton and zooplankton, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and non-grazing mortality) but uses different functional forms in several places and omits explicit physical mixing/dilution terms present in the TRUTH model. Uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Steele photoinhibition) and Q10 temperature modifiers are applied to rates. Grazing is a Holling Type II functional response (temperature-modulated) rather than the squared-saturating response used in the TRUTH model. Zooplankton mortality includes an additional quadratic density-dependent term. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but uses literature-aligned alternate formulations for uptake, light limitation, grazing and adds temperature and density-dependent closure terms; it does not implement the TRUTH mixing/dilution formulation.",
