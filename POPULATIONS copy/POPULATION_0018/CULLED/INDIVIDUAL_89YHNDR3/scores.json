  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ forward model with canonical uptake, growth, grazing, mortality, recycling and observation error, but it differs in functional forms from the TRUTH python NPZ in key ways. Uptake and growth are multiplicative co-limited Michaelis\u2013Menten \u00d7 light (Steele photoinhibition) with temperature Q10 scaling (an addition relative to TRUTH). Grazing is Holling Type II (alternate to TRUTH's Hill-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Recycling from grazers is represented but with different partitioning (excretion + mortality recycling). Mixing/entrainment in nutrients and mixing losses for P and Z in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P) are not represented as the same terms in the candidate (candidate uses a simple N_input term and no P/Z mixing). Several extra ecological processes (temperature/Q10, explicit Steele photoinhibition with self-shading, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and a simple constant nutrient input term) are present in the candidate but are not in the TRUTH reference.",
