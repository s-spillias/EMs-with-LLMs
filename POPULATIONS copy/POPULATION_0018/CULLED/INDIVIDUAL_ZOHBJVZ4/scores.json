  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ model with the canonical roles present (nutrient uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) but uses different mathematical choices for many components. Uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten in N times an explicit light limitation (Steele), grazing is Holling Type II, and mortality is mostly linear (with an additional quadratic zooplankton mortality). The candidate does not implement the TRUTH model's explicit mixing/entrainment term for state variables (no k*(N0 - N) or -k*P or analogous Z mixing). Several extra process components (explicit Q10 temperature scaling, explicit Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer light averaging + Steele photoinhibition, and an added quadratic zooplankton mortality term) are present that do not appear in the TRUTH NPZ formulation.",
