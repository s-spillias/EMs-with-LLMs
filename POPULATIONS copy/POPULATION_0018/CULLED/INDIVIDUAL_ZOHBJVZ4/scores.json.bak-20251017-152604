  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a biologically plausible NPZ model that preserves the core trophic flows (nutrient \u2192 phytoplankton \u2192 zooplankton) and recycling, but it uses different mathematical formulations in several places and adds environmental forcing (light and temperature) plus extra mortality structure. Uptake and growth are represented as Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Steele formulation) rather than the TRUTH model's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) form. Grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) versus the TRUTH Type\u2011III P^2/(mu^2+P^2). Zooplankton growth uses assimilation efficiency (epsilon) times grazing (present in TRUTH but combined differently). Important ecological processes present in TRUTH (explicit mixing/dilution of nutrients and phytoplankton via k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P) are missing in the candidate; instead the candidate has a simple constant N_input source. The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) adjustments, an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert / Steele light module, and quadratic zooplankton mortality\u2014these are extras not present in the TRUTH NPZ.",
