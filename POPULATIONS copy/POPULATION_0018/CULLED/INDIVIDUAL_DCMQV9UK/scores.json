  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ bookkeeping (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth, grazing -> zooplankton growth, mortality -> recycling) but uses different functional forms and adds multiple ecological processes not present in the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten style nutrient limitation and a separate light-limitation (so they are conceptually similar to TRUTH but not algebraically identical). Grazing is implemented as Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH Holling-type P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. Recycling from grazing includes an explicit unassimilated fraction and a separate mortality-recycling pathway. The candidate introduces several extra processes (temperature Q10 modifiers, explicit seasonal light forcing with depth-averaged irradiance and self-shading, food-dependent assimilation efficiency, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and a simple constant nutrient input term) and it omits direct equivalents of the TRUTH mixing/dilution losses for phytoplankton and zooplankton and the TRUTH mixing-form k*(N0 - N) (candidate uses N_input instead). Overall: all canonical roles are present, but many are implemented as alternates (different saturation/grazing/mortality forms) and several new forcings/closures are added.",
