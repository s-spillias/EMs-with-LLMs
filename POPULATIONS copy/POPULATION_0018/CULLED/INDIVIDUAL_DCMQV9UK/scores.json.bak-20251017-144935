  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth + recycling) but with several modeling extensions. Uptake and growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten/Monod-style nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light-limitation factor (and temperature Q10 modifiers), grazing is Holling type II with an explicit, food-dependent assimilation efficiency, and zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms. The candidate therefore matches the ecological roles in TRUTH but uses alternate mathematical forms for several terms and adds extra processes (temperature/Q10, seasonal and depth-resolved light attenuation, food-dependent assimilation efficiency, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and a constant N_input rather than the TRUTH mixing/dilution term).",

TRUTH used (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P))*P \u2014 both are multiplicative nutrient\u00d7light\u00d7P formulations but differ in functional form, so this is an alternate (Monod/ Michaelis-Menten style)."
