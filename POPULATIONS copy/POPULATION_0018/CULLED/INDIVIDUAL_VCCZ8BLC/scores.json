  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same basic NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, recycling) but uses different functional forms for several processes. Phytoplankton uptake is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten in N multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Steele formulation with Beer\u2013Lambert self-shading) rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) structure. Grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a Type-III / Hill (power-2) grazing in TRUTH. Mortality of phytoplankton is the same linear form, but zooplankton mortality in the candidate includes an extra quadratic term. The candidate lacks an explicit mixing/dilution term of the form k*(N0 - N) in the nutrient equation (it has a constant N_input instead). Overall many ecological roles are present but some parameterizations differ and two explicit processes (detailed light physics and quadratic zooplankton mortality) are added.",
