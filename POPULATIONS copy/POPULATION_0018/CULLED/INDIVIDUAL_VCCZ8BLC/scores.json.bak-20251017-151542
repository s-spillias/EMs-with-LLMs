  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth \u2192 recycling) but uses different mathematical formulations in several places and adds explicit light physics and a quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit Steele light limitation (an alternate to the TRUTH 'a/(b + cP)' dependence). Grazing is Holling Type II (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response). Recycling from zooplankton is present (excretion + mortality), but the candidate lacks the TRUTH-style mixing/dilution term (k*(N0 - N)) and instead uses a constant N_input term. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but often via alternate (literature-consistent) functional forms and includes two processes not present in TRUTH (explicit light dynamics and quadratic zooplankton mortality).",
