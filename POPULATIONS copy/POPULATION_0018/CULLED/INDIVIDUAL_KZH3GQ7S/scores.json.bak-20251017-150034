  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the same three-state NPZ structure and preserves the major ecological roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, mortality and recycling). However, many functional forms differ from the TRUTH model: nutrient/phytoplankton uptake is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten co-limited by an explicit light factor (a new process), grazing is Holling type II rather than the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH, and zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic term. The candidate also replaces TRUTH's mixing/dilution term k*(N0 - N) with a constant N_input flux (i.e., the TRUTH mixing form is not present). Statistical/estimation machinery (observation error, priors, soft bounds) and the Euler integrator are present but are not counted as ecological components.",
