  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same high-level NPZ roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from mortality/excretion, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and mortality terms) but uses different mathematical formulations for many processes. Phytoplankton growth is explicitly co-limited by nutrient Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake and a detailed, seasonal, depth-averaged light function with photoinhibition (Steele form). Grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate vs a Type\u2011III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) in the TRUTH. Nutrient recycling is represented explicitly (excretion + mortality recycling). The candidate lacks an explicit mixing/dilution term of the TRUTH form k*(N0 - N) and instead uses a constant N_input source term, so the mixing/dilution process in TRUTH is not represented. The candidate also adds processes not present in TRUTH (seasonal depth\u2011averaged light with self-shading and an explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality term).",
