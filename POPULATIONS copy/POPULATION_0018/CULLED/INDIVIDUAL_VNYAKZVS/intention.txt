MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system with several sophisticated features:
1. Light limitation with photoinhibition (Steele formulation)
2. Phytoplankton self-shading
3. Nutrient recycling from both phytoplankton and zooplankton
4. Density-dependent zooplankton mortality

PARAMETER ANALYSIS:
Review of parameters.json reveals that I_0 (surface light intensity) has a mean value of 443 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹ 
with bounds [163, 886], indicating substantial variability (>5-fold range). This wide range suggests that temporal 
variation in light availability is an important feature of the system being modeled.

KEY MISSING PROCESS:
The current model treats surface light intensity (I_0) as a constant parameter, which is ecologically unrealistic 
for oceanic systems. In reality, surface irradiance varies substantially over annual cycles due to:
- Solar elevation angle (seasonal variation in sun position)
- Day length (photoperiod changes with season)
- These factors combine to create strong seasonal forcing in temperate and polar oceans

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Seasonal light variation is a fundamental driver of phytoplankton bloom dynamics, particularly:
- Spring blooms triggered by increasing light and stratification
- Summer production limited by nutrient depletion despite high light
- Fall blooms when mixing replenishes nutrients
- Winter dormancy under low light conditions

The wide bounds on I_0 in the parameter file strongly suggest that the data being fitted includes 
observations across different seasons or light conditions. A constant I_0 cannot capture this variation.

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
Implement time-varying surface light intensity using a sinusoidal seasonal cycle:

I_0(t) = I_mean + I_amplitude * sin(2π * (t - t_phase) / 365)

Where:
- I_mean: Annual mean surface light intensity (replaces constant I_0)
- I_amplitude: Amplitude of seasonal variation in light
- t_phase: Day of year when light reaches minimum (typically ~355 for winter solstice in Northern Hemisphere)
- t: Time in days

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
The seasonal light function will be calculated at each time step and used in place of the constant I_0 
in the light attenuation and limitation calculations. This maintains all existing model structure while 
adding realistic temporal forcing.

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
1. I_mean: Annual mean surface PAR [200-600 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹]
2. I_amplitude: Seasonal amplitude [50-400 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹]
3. t_phase: Phase offset in days [0-365 days]

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
- More realistic representation of seasonal bloom dynamics
- Better fit to data collected across multiple seasons
- Captures the critical role of light as a time-varying environmental driver
- Maintains model parsimony (adds only 2-3 parameters depending on whether phase is fixed or estimated)

COMPLEXITY JUSTIFICATION:
This modification adds minimal complexity (2-3 parameters) but captures a fundamental ecological process. 
The wide observed range in I_0 values strongly suggests this temporal variation is present in the data 
and necessary for accurate model representation.
