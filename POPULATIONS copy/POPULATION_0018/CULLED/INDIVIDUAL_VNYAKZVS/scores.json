  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with different mechanistic choices in several places. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as Michaelis-Menten style nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Steele photoinhibition) \u2014 i.e., multiplicative co-limitation \u2014 instead of the TRUTH nutrient-only growth function. Grazing and zooplankton growth are present but use a Holling Type II form (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (a Type\u2011III / sigmoidal form). Phytoplankton non-grazing mortality is linear (matches TRUTH's linear mortality), but the candidate adds quadratic zooplankton mortality and an explicit seasonal light field (depth-averaged attenuation, self-shading, photoinhibition) that are not in TRUTH. Crucially, the candidate omits an explicit dilution/restoring mixing term of the form k*(N0 - N) for nutrients and lacks an explicit physical mixing loss for P and Z; instead it uses a single constant N_input source term for nutrients. Overall many canonical roles are present but several are implemented as literature alternates or are missing (mixing terms), and there are two clearly extra ecological processes (seasonal depth-averaged light with photoinhibition/self-shading; quadratic zooplankton mortality).",
