  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an ecologically plausible NPZ structure but with several structural differences from the TRUTH reference. Phytoplankton growth is implemented as a multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake times an explicit light limitation term (mixed-layer integrated light), rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c P)) * P functional form. Grazing is implemented as a Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) and zooplankton growth is the assimilated fraction of that grazing (epsilon * grazing), which captures the same ecological role as the TRUTH grazing\u2192zooplankton transfer but with a different functional family. Nutrient recycling is present (from phytoplankton mortality and zooplankton excretion/mortality) but implemented with simpler linear/efficiency terms instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2)-weighted contributions. The candidate uses a constant external nutrient input (N_input) rather than a restoring mixing term k*(N0 - N). Important extras relative to TRUTH are an explicit light module (I_0, MLD, k_w, k_p, explicit self-shading and depth-integration) and a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term. Numerical implementation (forward Euler) and likelihood/prior machinery are present in the candidate but are not ecological processes.",
