  "qualitative_description": "The candidate implements a standard NPZ architecture (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth/mortality) but uses different mechanistic formulations in several places. Uptake/growth are implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit depth\u2011averaged light limitation (a new light module). Grazing is Holling type II rather than the TRUTH model's quadratic/saturating predation kernel. Recycling from zooplankton and from phytoplankton mortality is present, but the candidate lacks the TRUTH model's mixing/dilution term that drives nutrients toward a background concentration. The candidate also includes a quadratic (density\u2011dependent) zooplankton mortality term and an explicit irradiance / mixed\u2011layer formulation that are not in TRUTH.",
