MODEL ASSESSMENT:

Current State:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, Holling Type II grazing, and nutrient recycling. All parameters remain at initial literature values.

Critical Gap Identified:
The model lacks LIGHT LIMITATION, which is essential for oceanic mixed layer plankton dynamics. In marine systems, phytoplankton growth is typically co-limited by both nutrients and light availability, not nutrients alone.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Nutrient-Light Co-limitation

Ecological Justification:
1. Light availability decreases exponentially with depth in the water column
2. Phytoplankton biomass creates self-shading (higher P reduces light penetration)
3. In the mixed layer, average light experienced by phytoplankton depends on:
   - Surface light intensity (I_0)
   - Mixed layer depth (MLD)
   - Light attenuation by water (k_w)
   - Light attenuation by phytoplankton self-shading (k_p)

Mathematical Implementation:
- Average light in mixed layer: I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-(k_w + k_p*P)*MLD)) / ((k_w + k_p*P)*MLD)
- Light limitation factor: L = I_avg / (I_avg + K_I)
- Modified growth: r_max * (N/(K_N + N)) * (I_avg/(I_avg + K_I)) * P

This creates multiplicative co-limitation where BOTH nutrients AND light must be available for growth.

New Parameters Added:
- I_0: Surface light intensity (W m^-2) - varies seasonally, typical range 50-400
- MLD: Mixed layer depth (m) - seasonal variation, typical range 10-100m
- k_w: Background light attenuation by water (m^-1) - ~0.04-0.2 for clear ocean water
- k_p: Specific light attenuation by phytoplankton (m^2 (g C)^-1) - ~0.02-0.1
- K_I: Half-saturation constant for light limitation (W m^-2) - ~20-50

Ecological Benefits:
1. Captures realistic dual limitation in marine systems
2. Introduces self-shading feedback (bloom self-limitation)
3. Allows seasonal forcing through I_0 and MLD variation
4. Prevents unrealistic phytoplankton growth in deep/dark conditions
5. More accurately represents mixed layer dynamics mentioned in PROJECT CONTEXT

This improvement maintains model tractability while adding essential realism for oceanic plankton population dynamics.
