  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the same three state variables (N, P, Z) and includes the canonical roles: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from zooplankton, phytoplankton growth and grazing losses, and zooplankton growth and mortality. However the functional forms differ in detail and the candidate adds multiple processes not present in the TRUTH model (explicit light seasonality & mixed-layer attenuation, Q10 temperature modifiers, stress-dependent phytoplankton mortality, variable assimilation efficiency, and quadratic zooplankton mortality). Several TRUTH terms are missing in the candidate (notably the explicit mixing/dilution term k*(N0-N) and a P-mixing loss). Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but with alternate functional forms and extra processes that increase realism/complexity.",
