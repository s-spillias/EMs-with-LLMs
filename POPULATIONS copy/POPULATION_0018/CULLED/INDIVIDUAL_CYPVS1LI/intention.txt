MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system with several sophisticated features:
- Seasonal light variation with self-shading
- Temperature dependence via Q10 coefficients
- Variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency based on food quality
- Nutrient recycling pathways

However, a critical ecological process is oversimplified: phytoplankton mortality is currently a constant rate (m_P = 0.05 day⁻¹), independent of environmental conditions.

=== ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED ===

In real oceanic systems, phytoplankton mortality is NOT constant but varies with physiological stress:

1. LIGHT STRESS: Phytoplankton in deep mixed layers or under prolonged low light experience:
   - Photoinhibition and oxidative damage
   - Reduced cellular repair capacity
   - Increased susceptibility to viral lysis

2. NUTRIENT STRESS: Severely nutrient-limited phytoplankton suffer:
   - Compromised cellular function
   - Programmed cell death (apoptosis)
   - Increased membrane permeability and lysis

3. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE: Field and laboratory studies show phytoplankton mortality rates can increase 2-5x under severe stress conditions compared to optimal conditions.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: STRESS-DEPENDENT MORTALITY ===

Add a stress-dependent component to phytoplankton mortality that increases when cells experience severe light or nutrient limitation.

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
m_P_effective = m_P_base * (1 + alpha_stress * stress_factor)

where:
- m_P_base: baseline mortality under optimal conditions (renamed from m_P)
- alpha_stress: stress mortality amplification factor (new parameter, dimensionless)
- stress_factor = (1 - min(light_limitation, nutrient_limitation))

ECOLOGICAL RATIONALE:
- When both light and nutrients are abundant (limitation factors → 1): stress_factor → 0, mortality ≈ m_P_base
- When either resource is severely limiting (limitation factors → 0): stress_factor → 1, mortality increases
- Uses minimum (most limiting factor) because cells respond to the worst stress
- The alpha_stress parameter controls how strongly stress increases mortality (expected range: 1-4 based on literature)

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES:
1. Prevents unrealistic phytoplankton accumulation under poor conditions
2. Creates more realistic bloom-crash dynamics
3. Strengthens negative feedback when phytoplankton deplete nutrients
4. Improves representation of deep mixing events (light stress increases mortality)

=== IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ===

NEW PARAMETER:
- alpha_stress: Stress mortality amplification factor
  - Units: dimensionless
  - Expected range: 1.0 - 4.0 (literature suggests 2-5x mortality increase under severe stress)
  - Initial value: 2.0 (moderate stress response)
  - Lower bound: 0.5 (weak stress response)
  - Upper bound: 5.0 (strong stress response)

RENAMED PARAMETER:
- m_P → m_P_base: Clarifies this is baseline mortality under optimal conditions
  - All other properties remain the same

MODEL CHANGES:
- Calculate stress_factor from light and nutrient limitation factors (already computed)
- Apply stress-dependent mortality in phytoplankton dynamics equation
- Stress-dependent mortality also affects nutrient recycling (more stressed cells → more nutrient release)

This improvement adds minimal complexity (one new parameter) but captures a fundamental ecological process that affects system stability and bloom dynamics.
