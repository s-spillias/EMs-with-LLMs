  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) but with several mechanistic differences vs. the TRUTH Python model. Both use Michaelis\u2013Menten style nutrient limitation and grazing-driven zooplankton production, and both return unassimilated/grazer-mortality fluxes to nutrients. Key differences: the candidate uses an explicit light physics module (Beer\u2013Lambert + Steele photo-inhibition) and an explicit Q10 temperature modifier on rates, uses a Holling type-II grazing function (candidate) versus the TRUTH's Hill/Holling type-III grazing (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)), and it omits the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N) and any phytoplankton mixing term. The candidate also adds quadratic zooplankton mortality. Overall many canonical ecological roles are present but realized with alternate functional forms or extra processes (explicit light, temperature/Q10, quadratic Z mortality).",
