  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing-mediated zooplankton growth, and recycling terms. Many ecological roles from the TRUTH model are present but implemented with different functional forms: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use Michaelis-Menten co-limited by an explicit light function (Steele photoinhibition) rather than the TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) term; grazing is Holling Type II instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) saturating form; non-grazing phytoplankton mortality matches the TRUTH linear mortality; mixing/entrainment as in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N)) is not represented \u2014 the candidate instead uses a constant N_input source. The candidate also adds processes not present in the TRUTH: an explicit light model (I_0, k_w, k_c, H, I_opt with Beer\u2013Lambert and Steele formulation), temperature dependence via Q10 applied to metabolic rates, and an explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and matches many alternate formulations in the literature, but it is not a direct algebraic match to the TRUTH model.",
