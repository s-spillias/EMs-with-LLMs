MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current NPZ model includes nutrient cycling, light limitation with self-shading, and density-dependent zooplankton mortality. These are appropriate for simulating plankton dynamics in the oceanic mixed layer.

KEY MISSING PROCESS:
Temperature dependence of biological rates. All metabolic processes in plankton (growth, grazing, mortality) are strongly temperature-dependent, typically doubling for every 10°C increase (Q10 ≈ 2). The oceanic mixed layer experiences significant temperature variation seasonally and spatially, making this a critical process for realistic plankton dynamics.

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:
Added temperature-dependent rate modification using Q10 formulation:
- Rate(T) = Rate(T_ref) × Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)

Where:
- T = water temperature (°C) - implemented as a parameter that can be estimated or fixed
- T_ref = reference temperature where base rates are defined (typically 15-20°C)
- Q10 = temperature coefficient (typically 1.5-3.0 for plankton, commonly ~2.0)

Applied to:
1. r_max: Phytoplankton growth rate (photosynthesis and cell division are temperature-sensitive)
2. g_max: Zooplankton grazing rate (feeding activity increases with temperature)
3. m_P: Phytoplankton mortality (respiration and senescence are temperature-dependent)
4. m_Z: Zooplankton mortality (metabolic costs increase with temperature)
5. m_Z2: Quadratic mortality (predator activity is temperature-dependent)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
Temperature is implemented as a constant parameter rather than time-varying data. This allows the model to:
- Estimate an effective average temperature from the data if desired
- Be fixed to a known temperature value
- Avoid data requirements when temperature time series are not available
- Still capture the fundamental temperature dependence of metabolic processes

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Enables simulation of temperature effects on plankton dynamics
- Captures how warming affects productivity and trophic interactions
- Allows investigation of climate warming impacts on plankton dynamics
- Widely supported by laboratory and field studies showing Q10 ≈ 2 for plankton metabolism
- Maintains model parsimony while adding critical environmental forcing

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Temperature modifier calculated once and applied multiplicatively to base rates before use in differential equations. This preserves the existing model structure while allowing rates to vary realistically with temperature.
