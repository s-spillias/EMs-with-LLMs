  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same three-state NPZ structure but uses different functional forms for several processes. Phytoplankton growth is modeled as Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit light limitation (integrated mixed-layer irradiance), and grazing is a Holling Type II functional response. Zooplankton growth uses an assimilation efficiency on grazing; zooplankton mortality in the candidate includes both linear and quadratic terms. The candidate therefore matches the ecological roles in the TRUTH model (growth, grazing, recycling, mortality) but many mathematical expressions differ (e.g., light-limited Michaelis-Menten uptake vs TRUTH's N/(e+N)*a/(b+cP) form; Holling-II grazing vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) and light attenuation / mixed-layer integration processes and quadratic zooplankton mortality that are not present in the TRUTH NPZ.",
