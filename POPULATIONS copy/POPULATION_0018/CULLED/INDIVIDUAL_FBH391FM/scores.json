  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with different mathematical choices than the TRUTH Python NPZ. Phytoplankton growth is formulated as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation factor (saturating PAR average), rather than the TRUTH\u2019s N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c*P)) * P form. Grazing is implemented as Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_P + P) * Z) versus the TRUTH\u2019s P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) (a Hill-type/power-2 saturating) functional response. Mortality terms for phytoplankton and zooplankton include linear losses (matching TRUTH\u2019s linear terms) but the candidate adds quadratic zooplankton mortality. The candidate includes explicit light attenuation/self-shading and a Q10 temperature modifier (both absent from TRUTH) and uses a one-sided constant nutrient input term (N_input) rather than the TRUTH\u2019s relaxation k*(N0 - N). Overall: same ecological roles present (growth, grazing, recycling, mortality), but many functional forms are alternates from the literature and the candidate adds explicit light and temperature processes and extra quadratic zooplankton mortality.",
