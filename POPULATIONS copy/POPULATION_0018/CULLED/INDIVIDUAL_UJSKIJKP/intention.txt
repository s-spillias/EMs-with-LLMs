NPZ Plankton Ecosystem Model

This model simulates the dynamics of a marine plankton ecosystem in the oceanic mixed layer, tracking three key state variables:
- Nutrient concentration (N): Dissolved inorganic nutrients (primarily nitrogen) available for phytoplankton uptake
- Phytoplankton concentration (P): Primary producers that convert nutrients into biomass through photosynthesis
- Zooplankton concentration (Z): Herbivorous grazers that consume phytoplankton

Ecological Processes:
1. Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton follows Michaelis-Menten (Type II functional response) kinetics, representing saturation at high nutrient concentrations
2. Phytoplankton growth is nutrient-limited with a maximum growth rate, and experiences natural mortality
3. Zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton follows a Holling Type II functional response with half-saturation constant, capturing handling time limitations
4. Zooplankton experience density-dependent mortality (quadratic term) representing predation by higher trophic levels
5. Nutrient recycling occurs through phytoplankton mortality and zooplankton excretion/mortality, with specific recycling efficiencies
6. The model includes a constant external nutrient input representing upwelling or mixing from deeper waters

Key Feedback Loops:
- Negative feedback: Phytoplankton growth depletes nutrients, limiting further growth
- Positive feedback: Nutrient recycling from mortality sustains productivity
- Trophic cascade: Zooplankton control phytoplankton, which controls nutrient drawdown
- Density dependence: Zooplankton self-limitation prevents runaway growth

This model structure can exhibit complex dynamics including stable equilibria, limit cycles, and chaotic behavior depending on parameter values, making it suitable for studying plankton bloom dynamics and ecosystem stability.
