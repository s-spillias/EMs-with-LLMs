  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth \u2192 mortality + recycling) but uses different functional forms in several places and omits the TRUTH model's explicit mixing/dilution term for nutrients and phytoplankton. Key matches: linear phytoplankton mortality is implemented identically (linear loss returned to nutrients). Key alternates: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Michaelis-Menten form (r_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH product of nutrient and light limitation; grazing is Holling Type II rather than a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Hill function; zooplankton mortality includes an additional quadratic density-dependent term (m_Z2 * Z^2) not present in TRUTH. Nutrient recycling is present but formulated as excretion + mortality recycling (gamma_Z * zoo_mortality + (1 - epsilon) * grazing) rather than the exact TRUTH terms. The candidate also lacks the TRUTH dilution term k*(N0 - N) (and lacks explicit phytoplankton mixing loss), which is an important mechanistic difference.",
