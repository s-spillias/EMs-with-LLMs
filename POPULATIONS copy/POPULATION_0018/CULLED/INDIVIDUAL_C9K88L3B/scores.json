  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements the same three-state NPZ framework but uses different functional forms for many processes. Phytoplankton growth is represented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake co-limited by an explicit light limitation (average mixed-layer PAR with self-shading) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) form. Grazing in the candidate is a Holling Type-II (P/(K_P+P)) with assimilation efficiency, whereas TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Hill-type with exponent 2) functional response. The candidate includes linear phytoplankton mortality matching TRUTH, but it omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms for P and Z and replaces the TRUTH mixing k*(N0 - N) with a one-way constant N_input (no corresponding dilution term). The candidate adds two processes not present in TRUTH: an explicit light limitation with bio-optical self-shading and a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term. Observation / likelihood machinery and parameter priors are present but are not ecological state processes.",
