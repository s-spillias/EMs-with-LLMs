  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth, grazing-mediated zooplankton growth, recycling from mortality/excretion), but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH NPZ in several places and omits the TRUTH mixing/dilution term. Key differences: uptake/growth are implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation (self\u2011shading + mixed layer averaging) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) form; grazing is Holling Type II instead of the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Type III\u2011like) formulation; zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic term; and the TRUTH mixing/dilution k*(N0-N) is absent (replaced by a constant N_input).",
