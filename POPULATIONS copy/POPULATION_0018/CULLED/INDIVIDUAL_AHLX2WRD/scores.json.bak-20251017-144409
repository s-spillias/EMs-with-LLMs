  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit nutrient uptake, recycling, grazing, phytoplankton mortality and zooplankton growth. However its functional forms differ in several places from the TRUTH reference: nutrient uptake is implemented as a Monod-type nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light (Steele) function (an alternate formulation vs TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b+cP) * P); grazing is Holling Type II (alternate vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Hill-like term); zooplankton mortality includes an additional quadratic term (extra process). Importantly the candidate lacks an explicit mixing/dilution term of the form k*(N0 - N) (present in TRUTH) and instead uses a constant N_input source term. The candidate also introduces an explicit light module (attenuation, mixed-layer averaging, photoinhibition) which is not present in the TRUTH code.",
