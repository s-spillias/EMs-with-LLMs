  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, mortalities, recycling) but uses different functional forms from the TRUTH model. Nutrient uptake/growth is implemented as multiplicative Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit light\u2011limitation (mixed\u2011layer integrated PAR) and a Q10 temperature multiplier. Grazing is Holling type II (P/(K+P)) with assimilation efficiency; zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms. The candidate omits the TRUTH-style mixing/dilution term k*(N0 - N) and instead uses a constant N_input source. Several extra processes (Q10 temperature scaling, explicit light attenuation + mixed-layer averaging, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and a constant external nutrient input) are present in the candidate but not in the TRUTH NPZ.",
