  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, recycling, and external nutrient source) but uses different functional forms and adds mechanistic components. Phytoplankton growth is multiplicatively limited by N and light (candidate: Michaelis-Menten N and an explicit I/(I+K_I) light term derived from Beer\u2013Lambert averaging), whereas TRUTH uses N/(e+N) times a/(b+c P). Grazing is implemented as Holling Type II in the candidate vs. a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH. Non\u2011grazing phytoplankton mortality is implemented equivalently (linear), but the candidate omits the explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss present in TRUTH. The candidate adds explicit temperature dependence (Q10), an explicit light-attenuation / mixed-layer averaging (I_avg from k_w, k_c, H), and quadratic zooplankton mortality. Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and maps to TRUTH largely via alternate, commonly used functional forms.",
