NPZ Plankton Ecosystem Model

This model simulates the dynamics of a marine planktonic ecosystem in the oceanic mixed layer, tracking three key components:

1. NUTRIENT (N): Dissolved inorganic nutrients (primarily nitrogen) that limit phytoplankton growth
2. PHYTOPLANKTON (P): Microscopic photosynthetic organisms that form the base of the marine food web
3. ZOOPLANKTON (Z): Small heterotrophic organisms that graze on phytoplankton

ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

Nutrient Dynamics:
- Nutrients are consumed by phytoplankton during growth (uptake follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics)
- Nutrients are recycled from phytoplankton mortality and zooplankton excretion
- Recycling efficiency reflects that not all organic matter is immediately remineralized

Phytoplankton Dynamics:
- Growth is nutrient-limited following a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) function
- Natural mortality occurs due to viral lysis, senescence, and other non-grazing losses
- Grazing by zooplankton follows a Holling Type II functional response (saturating with prey density)

Zooplankton Dynamics:
- Growth depends on phytoplankton consumption with an assimilation efficiency
- The functional response saturates at high phytoplankton densities (handling time limitation)
- Natural mortality includes respiration, predation by higher trophic levels, and other losses

FEEDBACK LOOPS:
- Phytoplankton growth depletes nutrients, creating bottom-up limitation
- Zooplankton grazing controls phytoplankton, creating top-down control
- Nutrient recycling from mortality creates a closed loop that sustains productivity
- The system can exhibit oscillatory dynamics or approach stable equilibria depending on parameter values

This classic NPZ formulation captures the essential dynamics of planktonic ecosystems and has been extensively validated against oceanic observations.
