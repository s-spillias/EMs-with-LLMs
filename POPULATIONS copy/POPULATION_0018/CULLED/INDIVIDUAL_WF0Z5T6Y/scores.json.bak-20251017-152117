  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake/growth, grazing, mortality, recycling, zooplankton growth) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model in several places. Specifically, uptake/growth is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) nutrient uptake times linear P (V_max * N/(K_N + N) * P) rather than the TRUTH\u2019s Monod-in-N combined with a light/biomass-limitation factor a/(b + c*P). Grazing is Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_P + P) * Z) in the candidate while TRUTH uses a Type-III-like P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) dependence. Mortality is linear in both models, and zooplankton growth is assimilation-of-grazing in both, but with different grazing formulations and placement of recycling terms. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt and dP/dt (TRUTH had k*(N0 - N) and -(k)*P). The candidate also includes statistical/modeling extras (observation error SDs, likelihood, soft parameter penalties) and numerical safeguards, which are not ecological processes.",

TRUTH uses \"(N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c*P))*P\" which is Monod-in-N multiplied by a light/biomass-modulation; candidate matches the Monod-in-N family but uses a simpler P-dependence (linear) so it is an alternate implementation."
