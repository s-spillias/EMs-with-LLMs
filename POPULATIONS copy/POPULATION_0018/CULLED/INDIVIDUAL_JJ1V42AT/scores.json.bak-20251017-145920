  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard Monod-type NPZ with Holling II grazing and linear mortalities, plus explicit recycling from mortality and excretion. It differs from the TRUTH Python NPZ primarily by: (1) using a simple nutrient Monod term for phytoplankton uptake (no P-dependent light/self-shading term a/(b + c*P) or the quadratic P-dependence used in TRUTH grazing), (2) using a Holling Type II grazing (g_max * P /(K_P + P)) rather than the TRUTH Hill-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response, and (3) omitting any explicit mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations. Many ecological roles are present (uptake, grazing, mortality, remineralization, excretion, assimilation), but the functional forms are alternates to the TRUTH model rather than exact matches except for linear mortality terms and linear zooplankton mortality/growth structure.",
