  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard Monod/Holling-II NPZ structure and many canonical processes (nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling, assimilation) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH Python NPZ. Uptake/growth are simple Monod (N/(K+N) * r) without the TRUTH model's additional light/packaging factor a/(b + cP). Grazing is Holling Type II rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. Recycling is present (mortality recycling and an explicit excretion term), but the candidate omits the environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) in dN/dt) and also omits mixing terms in the phytoplankton equation that TRUTH included. Zooplankton growth and mortality are represented via assimilation efficiency and linear loss respectively (conceptually matching TRUTH but with a different grazing kernel). No truly new ecological processes (extra state variables or novel pools) appear in the candidate beyond alternative parametrizations of recycling and grazing.",
