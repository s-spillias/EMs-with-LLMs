  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth + mortality + recycling). Many ecological roles in the TRUTH model are present but implemented with different functional forms and several additional processes. Uptake/growth use multiplicative co-limitation (Michaelis-Menten nutrient term \u00d7 explicit light limitation with photoinhibition) rather than the TRUTH's single combined factor. Grazing and zooplankton assimilation are present but use a Holling Type II functional response (P/(K_P+P)) and include temperature scaling and an extra quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Nutrient recycling from grazing inefficiency and zooplankton mortality is implemented. However, the candidate lacks an explicit mixing/entrainment/dilution sink of the form k*(N0 - N) and lacks an explicit physical mixing loss for P as in TRUTH. The candidate adds explicit light attenuation/self-shading and Q10 temperature modifiers (new processes relative to TRUTH).",
