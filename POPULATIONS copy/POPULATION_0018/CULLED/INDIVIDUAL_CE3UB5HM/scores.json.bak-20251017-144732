  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling from mortalities/excretion) but with different functional forms and some additional processes. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit light-limitation term (depth-averaged attenuation), whereas the TRUTH uses a single combined nutrient/uptake term (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P))*P and no explicit light module. Grazing and zooplankton growth are present but use a Holling-type (P/(K_P+P)) functional form rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. The candidate also omits an explicit dilution/entrainment term of the form k*(N0 - N) and instead uses a constant N_input source, and it adds quadratic zooplankton mortality. Overall, most canonical roles are present but implemented as ALTERNATE functional forms; two\u2013three additional processes appear that are not in the TRUTH model.",
