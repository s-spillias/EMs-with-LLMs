  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth with mortality and recycling), but with several structural differences from the TRUTH NPZ. Key differences: uptake in the candidate is a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten form without the separate light limitation factor used in TRUTH; grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) versus a sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response (TRUTH); the candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/dilution term k*(N0-N) and instead uses a constant N_input source term; and the candidate includes an additional quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term (m_Z2 * Z^2) that is not present in TRUTH. The candidate also expresses recycling differently (explicit (1-epsilon)*grazing excretion term and recycling from zooplankton mortality), and uses statistical / numerical apparatus (observation errors, priors, Euler integration) that are not part of the TRUTH ecological equations.",
