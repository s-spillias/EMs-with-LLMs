  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ with nutrient-limited, light-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling-II grazing, assimilation-based zooplankton growth, and linear + quadratic zooplankton mortality. Many canonical roles from the TRUTH model are represented (uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth), but the functional forms differ in key places: the candidate uses multiplicative Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit light limitation (depth-averaged irradiance) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) times a/(b + c P) factor; grazing is Holling type II rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) (a sigmoidal type-III-like form); mixing/dilution is not represented as the TRUTH's k*(N0-N) term (the candidate has only a constant N_input). The candidate also adds explicit light physics (self-shading, attenuation, mixed-layer averaging) and an explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality term that are not present in TRUTH.",
