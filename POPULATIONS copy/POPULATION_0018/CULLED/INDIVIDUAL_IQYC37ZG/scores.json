  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth with assimilation efficiency, recycling from grazing and mortality) but uses different functional forms and adds an explicit light attenuation / mixed-layer light limitation module and a quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term multiplied by an explicit light limitation (multiplicative co-limitation), grazing is Holling Type II (classic saturating) rather than the TRUTH quadratic/sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form, and mixing/entrainment is represented only as a simple constant input (N_input) rather than the TRUTH dilution toward a background concentration k*(N0-N) and explicit P/Z mixing losses. Overall the candidate matches ecological roles but not the exact TRUTH algebra for many terms and contains two clear extra ecological processes (explicit light attenuation/self-shading and quadratic zooplankton density-dependent mortality).",
