ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:

The current NPZ model includes light-nutrient co-limitation, self-shading, and nutrient recycling. 
It successfully represents basic plankton dynamics in the oceanic mixed layer.

However, a critical ecological process is missing: TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE of biological rates.

IDENTIFIED GAP:
Ocean temperature is a master variable controlling metabolic rates of all organisms. The current 
model assumes constant temperature, which is unrealistic for oceanic systems that experience:
- Seasonal temperature cycles (5-15째C variation in temperate oceans)
- Spatial gradients (polar vs tropical waters differ by 20-30째C)
- Climate change warming trends

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:
Added temperature-dependent rate modification using Q10 formulation:
- Q10 describes the factor by which a rate increases for every 10째C temperature increase
- This is the standard approach in marine biogeochemical models (e.g., NPZD models)

SPECIFIC CHANGES:
1. Added Q10 parameters for key processes:
   - Q10_phyto: Temperature sensitivity of phytoplankton growth (typical range 1.5-2.5)
   - Q10_zoo: Temperature sensitivity of zooplankton grazing (typical range 2.0-3.0)
   - Q10_remin: Temperature sensitivity of remineralization (typical range 2.0-4.0)
2. Added reference temperature parameter (T_ref = 15째C, typical temperate ocean value)
3. Modified rate equations to include temperature factors:
   - Phytoplankton growth: r_max * f(T) * nutrient_lim * light_lim
   - Zooplankton grazing: g_max * f(T) * functional_response
   - Remineralization: gamma * f(T) * mortality

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
Temperature factor: f(T) = Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)

This exponential relationship captures the Arrhenius-like temperature dependence of enzyme kinetics
but is simpler and more commonly used in ecological models.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
The model currently runs at constant temperature (T = T_ref), so all temperature factors equal 1.0.
This means the model behaves identically to the previous version until temperature data is provided.
The infrastructure is in place to utilize temperature variation when T_dat becomes available.

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS (when temperature data is available):
- Better fit to seasonal data (if temperature varies)
- Ability to predict responses to warming
- More realistic representation of polar vs tropical dynamics
- Improved parameter identifiability (separating temperature effects from intrinsic rates)

ECOLOGICAL REALISM:
This addition is well-justified because:
1. Temperature is universally recognized as controlling plankton metabolism
2. Q10 values are well-documented in literature for marine plankton
3. The formulation is standard in marine biogeochemical models
4. It adds minimal complexity (4 parameters) for substantial ecological realism
5. The model remains backward-compatible (runs at constant T_ref when no temperature data exists)
