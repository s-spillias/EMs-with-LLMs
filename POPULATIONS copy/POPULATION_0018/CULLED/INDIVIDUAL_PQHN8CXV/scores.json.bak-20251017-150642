  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ (uptake, growth, grazing, recycling, zooplankton mortality/growth) but uses different mathematical choices for several terms and also adds processes not present in TRUTH. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation \u00d7 light limitation (with explicit light attenuation and mixed-layer averaging), grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form (TRUTH), and recycling from unassimilated grazing and mortality is present in both. Important differences: the candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/dilution term k*(N0-N) and instead uses a simple constant N_input; the candidate adds temperature dependence (Q10 factors), explicit light attenuation/self-shading and averaging, and quadratic zooplankton mortality. Overall the candidate matches many ecological roles but not exact TRUTH functional forms; several terms correspond to standard alternates in the literature.",
