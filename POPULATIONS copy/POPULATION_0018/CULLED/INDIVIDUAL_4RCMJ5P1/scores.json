  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a classic NPZ structure (uptake \u2192 P growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 Z growth \u2192 recycling) but with several formulation differences vs the TRUTH Python model. Uptake/growth are implemented as Michaelis-Menten (Monod) nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert depth-averaged irradiance + exponential saturating f_I), whereas TRUTH uses a combined nutrient-dependent term (N/(e+N)) times an a/(b+cP) factor (no explicit light). Grazing in the candidate is Holling type II (P/(K_P+P)), while TRUTH uses a saturating quadratic/Holling-III-like form (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). Linear mortalities are present in both models and match TRUTH. The candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N) and mixing loss on P), and it introduces an explicit light limitation (depth averaging, I_0, k_w, k_c, H, I_k) that is not in TRUTH. Recycling is present but implemented as a fraction of mortalities and unassimilated grazing (gamma*(P_mortality + (1-eps)*grazing + Z_mortality)), which is conceptually similar but algebraically different from TRUTH's separate beta/alpha/gamma terms.",
