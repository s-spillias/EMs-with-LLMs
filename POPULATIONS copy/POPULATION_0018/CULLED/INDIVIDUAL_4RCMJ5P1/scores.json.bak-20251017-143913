  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, recycling, and zooplankton growth/mortality) but uses different functional forms in several places and omits physical mixing/entrainment present in the TRUTH model. Notably, the candidate adds an explicit depth-averaged light calculation and a light-limitation factor (f_I) that is absent in the TRUTH code (which instead uses a/(b + c*P) in the growth term). Recycling in the candidate is computed from explicit mortality and excretion terms, whereas TRUTH splits recycling into several terms (r*P, beta*lambda*P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z, gamma*q*Z). Overall: most ecological roles are present, several are implemented as literature alternates (Michaelis\u2013Menten + explicit light limitation; Holling II grazing), and environmental mixing of nutrients/phytoplankton is missing in the candidate.",
