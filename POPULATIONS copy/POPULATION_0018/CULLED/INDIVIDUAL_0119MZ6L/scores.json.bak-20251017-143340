  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling terms, but it differs from the TRUTH model in several mechanistic choices. Uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term multiplied by an explicit, depth-integrated light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert + Monod for light) \u2014 a process not present in the TRUTH code. Grazing is Holling type-II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form in TRUTH. Recycling is handled as a pooled fraction (gamma) of mortalities and unassimilated grazing rather than the separate TRUTH terms (r*P, beta*lambda_*...*Z, gamma*q*Z). Important absences versus TRUTH: the candidate does not include the environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N) or (s + k)*P) so it cannot represent dilution/entrainment present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches canonical ecological roles but uses alternate functional forms for several processes and introduces an explicit light attenuation / depth-averaging module as an extra ecological component.",
