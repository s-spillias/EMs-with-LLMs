  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same basic 3-box NPZ structure (N, P, Z) and includes the core interactions (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, phytoplankton grazing by zooplankton, and zooplankton growth from grazing). However, its mathematical choices differ from the TRUTH NPZ in several ways: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis-Menten (Monod) nutrient limitation times a separate light limitation (plus Q10 temperature factors), grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form, recycling from grazers is split into unassimilated grazing + mortality-based recycling (and scaled by Q_current), and there is no explicit mixing/dilution term of the form k*(N0 - N). The candidate also adds several ecological processes not present in TRUTH (temperature/Q10 modifiers, seasonal light forcing with attenuation/self-shading, dynamic phytoplankton C:N quota and quota-based conversion of carbon growth to nutrient uptake, variable assimilation efficiency linked to stoichiometry, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and a constant external nutrient input term). Many of these extras are well-known alternate formulations in the literature (e.g., Monod uptake, Holling II grazing, quadratic mortality) but they are not algebraically identical to the TRUTH terms.",
