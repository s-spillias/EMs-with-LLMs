  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, mortality terms and recycling) but with different mathematical choices and several added ecological processes. Phytoplankton growth is modeled as multiplicative Monod (nutrient) \u00d7 saturating light limitation with explicit light attenuation, rather than the TRUTH combined N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP))*P form. Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) instead of the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. Zooplankton growth uses an assimilation efficiency (here variable with nutrient status) and mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms. The candidate omits the TRUTH-style mixing relaxation k*(N0 - N) and instead uses a constant N_input source; it also adds explicit seasonal temperature (Q10) modifiers and a seasonal light model. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but differs in functional families for uptake, grazing, and mixing and introduces multiple extra processes (temperature/Q10, seasonal light, variable assimilation efficiency, quadratic Z-mortality, simple external nutrient input).",
