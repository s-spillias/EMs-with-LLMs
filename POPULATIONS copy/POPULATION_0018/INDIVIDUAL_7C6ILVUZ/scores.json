  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core three-compartment structure (N, P, Z) with biologically plausible uptake, growth, grazing, mortality and recycling terms. It uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation to drive phytoplankton growth, Holling-type II grazing with an assimilation efficiency to drive zooplankton growth, and explicit recycling from grazing and mortality. Key departures versus the TRUTH model: (1) no explicit mixing/dilution term of the form k*(N0 - N) or an equivalent entrainment/dilution acting on P and Z, (2) explicit seasonal light forcing and an optical attenuation/depth-average formulation (including I_0_mean, I_0_amplitude, k_w, k_c, z_mix, K_I) that are more mechanistic than the TRUTH a/(b + c*P) light term, and (3) explicit Q10 temperature modifiers on rates and an added quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Overall most canonical ecological roles are present but some are represented by alternate functional forms and environmental drivers are more complex.",
