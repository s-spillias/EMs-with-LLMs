  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the same high-level NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth and mortality) but uses different functional forms for several terms and adds explicit physical/physiological processes absent from the TRUTH code. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times a light limitation (an alternate formulation to TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b+cP)) * P). Grazing is Holling type II (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Phytoplankton non-grazing mortality is a linear term matching TRUTH's linear loss, but physical mixing of P and the TRUTH mixing/dilution term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) are not represented the same way. The candidate also includes extra processes (seasonal light attenuation/self-shading, Q10 temperature scaling, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and a simple constant nutrient input) that are not present in the TRUTH NPZ.",
