  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes but with common alternate functional forms. Phytoplankton growth is modeled as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake times an explicit light-limitation (I_avg/(I_avg+K_I)) derived from exponential attenuation (self-shading via k_c*P) rather than the TRUTH's simple a/(b + c*P) factor. Grazing is Holling type II (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form. Recycling from zooplankton is present (unassimilated fraction + mortality recycling). Phytoplankton linear mortality matches TRUTH exactly. The candidate adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term (m_Z2 * Z^2) that is not in TRUTH. Physical mixing/entrainment terms for P and Z are absent in the candidate, and the candidate uses a simple constant N_input for nutrients instead of TRUTH's restoring mixing k*(N0 - N). Overall, most canonical components are present but in alternate standard forms; mixing terms for P and Z and the TRUTH-style restorative nutrient mixing are missing, and quadratic zooplankton mortality is an extra process.",
