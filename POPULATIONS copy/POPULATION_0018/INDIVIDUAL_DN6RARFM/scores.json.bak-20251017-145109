  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth; grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth; mortality and recycling back to nutrients) but uses different functional forms for several processes. Key differences: explicit light limitation with self\u2011shading is included (not present in the TRUTH code), grazing is Holling Type II rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form, zooplankton mortality includes an added quadratic term, and nutrient mixing/dilution in the TRUTH (k*(N0-N)) is not represented as such in the candidate (the candidate has a simple positive N_input without the complementary dilution term). Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but with alternate mathematical choices for uptake, grazing, recycling and additional density\u2011dependent zooplankton mortality and explicit light attenuation.",
