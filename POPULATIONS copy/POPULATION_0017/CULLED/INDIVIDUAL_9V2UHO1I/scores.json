  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the main NPZ processes (uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) but uses different functional forms in several places and omits physical mixing/entrainment terms present in the TRUTH model. Uptake is implemented as a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient term multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation calculated from Beer\u2011Lambert averaging over a mixed layer (an extra, more mechanistic light submodel). Grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate vs. a sigmoidal/Holling\u2011III type in TRUTH. Phytoplankton non\u2011grazing mortality is the same linear form as TRUTH, but zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density dependent) rather than TRUTH's linear loss. The candidate recycles unassimilated grazing and mortality to nutrients (standard alternate formulation) but does not include the explicit environmental mixing/dilution term (k*(N0-N)) or explicit phytoplankton/zooplankton mixing losses that appear in TRUTH.",
