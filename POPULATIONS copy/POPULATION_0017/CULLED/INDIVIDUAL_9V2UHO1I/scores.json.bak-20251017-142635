  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but uses different mathematical formulations in several places. Phytoplankton uptake/growth is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert mixed\u2011layer average) rather than the TRUTH\u2019s P\u2011dependent photosynthetic factor a/(b + c*P). Grazing is Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) rather than the TRUTH\u2019s sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) term. Phytoplankton linear mortality is present and matches the TRUTH linear loss. Zooplankton growth is assimilation of grazing (matches the ecological role) but uses the Holling II grazing term; zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density\u2011dependent) rather than the TRUTH\u2019s linear mortality. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations that the TRUTH model includes. The candidate also adds an explicit light attenuation / mixed\u2011layer averaging process (I0, k_w, k_p, z_mix) not present in the TRUTH model. Observation/error and soft parameter\u2011penalty machinery are present but are modeling infrastructure, not ecological processes.",
