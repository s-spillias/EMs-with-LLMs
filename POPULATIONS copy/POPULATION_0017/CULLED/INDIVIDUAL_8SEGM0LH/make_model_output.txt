I'll assess the current model and propose a meaningful ecological improvement.

Key Observations:                                                                                                                                                                                                           

 1 Parameter Updates: The maximum phytoplankton growth rate r has been updated from literature (value: 1.0, bounds: 0.8-1.2), suggesting this is a well-constrained parameter.                                              
 2 Missing Ecological Realism: The model uses constant mortality rates (m_P and m_Z), but in real plankton systems, zooplankton mortality often increases with density due to:                                              
    • Increased predation pressure at higher densities (more visible to predators)                                                                                                                                          
    • Cannibalism in some zooplankton species                                                                                                                                                                               
    • Disease transmission (density-dependent)                                                                                                                                                                              
 3 Ecological Gap: The current linear mortality for zooplankton (m_Z * Z) doesn't capture the quadratic (density-dependent) mortality that is commonly observed in marine ecosystems and is critical for preventing         
   unrealistic zooplankton blooms.                                                                                                                                                                                          

Proposed Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Add density-dependent (quadratic) mortality for zooplankton to represent higher trophic level predation and intraspecific interactions. This is a well-established ecological mechanism that:                               

 • Prevents unrealistic zooplankton accumulation                                                                                                                                                                            
 • Creates more realistic predator-prey oscillations                                                                                                                                                                        
 • Represents implicit higher trophic level control                                                                                                                                                                         
 • Is mathematically simple but ecologically meaningful                                                                                                                                                                     

This changes zooplankton mortality from m_Z * Z to m_Z * Z + m_Z2 * Z², where m_Z2 represents the density-dependent mortality coefficient.

 +The model uses linear mortality for zooplankton (m_Z * Z), which is ecologically unrealistic for marine systems. In natural plankton communities, zooplankton mortality typically shows density-dependence due to:        
 +1. Higher trophic level predation (fish, jellyfish) that increases with prey density

 +The new parameter m_Z2 should be small (typically 0.01-0.1 range) as it acts on squared biomass. Lower bound of 0.0 ensures non-negative mortality contribution. Upper bound prevents excessive mortality that would
