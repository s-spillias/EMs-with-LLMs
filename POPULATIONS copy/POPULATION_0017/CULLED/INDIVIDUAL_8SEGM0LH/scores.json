  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard, mechanistic NPZ structure but does not exactly match the TRUTH model. It uses a Monod/Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth and a Holling Type II grazing functional response (both common literature alternates), with assimilation efficiency converting grazed P into Z and recycling via mortality and unassimilated grazing. It omits the TRUTH model's P-dependent light/attenuation factor (a/(b + c*P) or the P^2 Type-III grazing) and also omits an explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term of the form k*(N0-N). The candidate adds an explicit quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term not present in TRUTH. Numerical/implementation differences (discrete forward update, eps lower bounds, observation-likelihood machinery) are present but not ecological processes.",
