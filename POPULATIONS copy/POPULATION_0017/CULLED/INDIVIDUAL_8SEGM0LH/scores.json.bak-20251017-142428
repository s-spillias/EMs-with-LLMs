  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a classic mass-balance NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, mortality returning material to nutrients). However, several functional forms differ from the TRUTH NPZ: the candidate uses standard Michaelis\u2013Menten/Monod nutrient limitation and a Holling Type II grazing (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (a Hill-type / sigmoidal uptake/grazing). The candidate includes explicit quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality (m_Z2 * Z^2) not present in TRUTH, and it omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations. Many ecological roles are present but implemented as common alternates from the literature rather than exact matches to the TRUTH functional forms.",

      "explanation": "Candidate uses Monod/Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation: \"Type growth_rate = r * N_prev / (K_N + N_prev);\" and uptake applied as \"Type P_growth = growth_rate * P_prev * dt;\" which enters nutrients as \"N_pred(i) = N_prev - P_growth + ...\". TRUTH used N/(e+N) multiplied by an additional a/(b + c*P) factor, so the candidate is an alternate (standard Michaelis-Menten) form."

TRUTH has analogous recycling terms (e.g., beta*lambda...*Z and gamma*q*Z) but with different parameterization, so this is an alternate implementation."
