  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same three-state NPZ framework (N, P, Z) and includes uptake, grazing, mortality, and recycling terms, but the functional forms differ in key ways from the TRUTH model. The candidate uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake (no light/self-shading term), a Holling II grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality (matching TRUTH's linear mortality form), and an expanded zooplankton mortality that includes both linear and quadratic terms. Recycling is present for phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton mortality, and unassimilated grazing, but there is no explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for any state (TRUTH contains k*(N0 - N) and (s + k)*P). Overall the candidate matches ecological roles but uses alternate functional families for several components and adds quadratic zooplankton mortality (an extra process relative to TRUTH).",

TRUTH has analogous returns (e.g. \"r * P\", \"(beta * lambda_ * P**2/(mu**2+P**2))*Z\", \"gamma * q * Z\"), but the algebraic forms and coefficient placement differ (candidate recycles from quadratic Z_mortality too).
