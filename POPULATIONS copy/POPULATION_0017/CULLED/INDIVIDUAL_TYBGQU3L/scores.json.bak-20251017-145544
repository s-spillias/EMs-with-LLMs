  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling. Many ecological roles in the TRUTH model are present (uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling, assimilation), but functional forms differ: the candidate uses classic Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake and Holling type II grazing, while the TRUTH uses a more complex product of N/(e+N) and a/(b+cP) for uptake and a Type-III-like grazing term P^2/(mu^2+P^2). The candidate also omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for N and P that the TRUTH contains, and it adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term not present in TRUTH.",
