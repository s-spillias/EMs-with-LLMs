NPZ Model: Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton Dynamics in the Oceanic Mixed Layer

This model simulates the coupled dynamics of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z) in the oceanic mixed layer, representing a fundamental marine food web structure.

ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

1. Nutrient Uptake by Phytoplankton:
   - Phytoplankton take up dissolved nutrients following Michaelis-Menten (Type II functional response) kinetics
   - Maximum uptake rate is modulated by phytoplankton biomass
   - Half-saturation constant represents nutrient limitation threshold

2. Phytoplankton Growth and Losses:
   - Growth is nutrient-limited following Monod kinetics
   - Natural mortality represents respiration, viral lysis, and other non-grazing losses
   - Phytoplankton biomass is removed through zooplankton grazing

3. Zooplankton Grazing:
   - Grazing follows a Type II functional response (Holling disc equation)
   - Represents saturation at high prey densities due to handling time
   - Only a fraction of consumed phytoplankton is assimilated into zooplankton biomass (assimilation efficiency)

4. Zooplankton Mortality:
   - Natural mortality includes respiration, excretion, and predation by higher trophic levels
   - Quadratic mortality term represents density-dependent losses (e.g., cannibalism, disease)

5. Nutrient Recycling:
   - Nutrients are regenerated from phytoplankton mortality
   - Zooplankton excretion and mortality return nutrients to the dissolved pool
   - Inefficient grazing (egestion) also recycles nutrients
   - Recycling efficiencies represent the fraction of organic matter that is remineralized vs. exported

MODEL ASSUMPTIONS:
- Well-mixed surface layer (no spatial structure)
- Constant physical environment (temperature, light, mixing)
- Closed system with respect to nutrients (no external inputs/outputs)
- Phytoplankton are nutrient-limited (light is not explicitly modeled)
- Single phytoplankton and zooplankton functional groups

EXPECTED DYNAMICS:
The model can exhibit various behaviors depending on parameter values:
- Stable equilibrium with coexistence of all three components
- Oscillatory dynamics (predator-prey cycles)
- Nutrient depletion leading to phytoplankton crashes
- Zooplankton-driven top-down control of phytoplankton
