MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing NPZ model includes:
- Nutrient (N), Phytoplankton (P), and Zooplankton (Z) dynamics
- Light limitation with self-shading (Beer-Lambert law)
- Temperature dependence (Q10 formulation)
- Nutrient recycling from mortality
- Density-dependent zooplankton mortality (quadratic)

PARAMETER ANALYSIS:
Key updated parameters from literature:
1. m_Z = 2.426 (tight bounds: 2.276-2.576) - strong empirical support for quadratic mortality
2. r lower bound = 0.28 - suggests slower phytoplankton growth than initially assumed
3. These updates indicate the model structure is appropriate but could benefit from more realistic nutrient-growth coupling

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The current model assumes instantaneous coupling between external nutrient availability and phytoplankton growth (Michaelis-Menten). This oversimplifies phytoplankton physiology, which actually involves:
- Nutrient uptake into cells (luxury uptake possible)
- Internal storage as nutrient quota
- Growth rate dependent on internal quota, not external concentration
- Temporal decoupling between uptake and growth

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT - DROOP QUOTA MODEL:
Implement internal nutrient quota dynamics for phytoplankton:

NEW STATE VARIABLE:
- Q: Internal nutrient quota (g N per g C in phytoplankton)

MODIFIED EQUATIONS:
1. Nutrient uptake (V) now separate from growth:
   V = V_max * (N / (K_N + N)) * P
   where V_max is maximum uptake rate

2. Phytoplankton growth now quota-dependent (Droop equation):
   μ = μ_max * (1 - Q_min/Q) * light_limitation * f_temp_P
   where Q_min is minimum (subsistence) quota

3. Quota dynamics:
   dQ/dt = V/P - μ*Q
   (uptake per biomass minus dilution by growth)

4. Modified nutrient equation:
   dN/dt = -V + recycling terms

5. Modified phytoplankton equation:
   dP/dt = μ*P - grazing - mortality

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Captures luxury uptake and storage (Droop 1968, 1973)
- Explains bloom persistence after nutrient depletion
- Creates realistic time lags in nutrient-phytoplankton dynamics
- Better represents physiological constraints on growth
- Particularly important given updated slower growth rate (r ≥ 0.28)

NEW PARAMETERS NEEDED:
- V_max: Maximum nutrient uptake rate (day^-1)
- Q_min: Minimum (subsistence) quota (g N / g C)
- Q_max: Maximum quota for saturation (g N / g C)
- Initial Q value

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- More realistic temporal dynamics
- Better representation of bloom formation and collapse
- Improved fit during nutrient-depleted periods
- Physiologically grounded phytoplankton response

This represents a well-established ecological refinement that adds mechanistic realism without excessive complexity.
