  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same high-level NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, recycling, zooplankton growth and mortality) but uses different mechanistic choices than the TRUTH Python model. Key differences: the candidate uses an explicit Droop internal-quota state (Q) to regulate uptake/growth, a Holling-II grazing formulation (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form, quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality instead of TRUTH linear mortality, explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation averaged over a mixed layer, and Q10 temperature scaling applied to rates. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (the TRUTH k*(N0 - N) term is not present). Overall, components are present but several are alternate formulations and there are two clear extra ecological components (internal quota state and Q10 temperature scaling).",

TRUTH uses a Monod-like external uptake times a/(b + c*P): \"- (N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P\".

TRUTH recycles via terms like \"(beta * lambda_ * P**2 / (mu**2 + P**2)) * Z + gamma * q * Z\".
