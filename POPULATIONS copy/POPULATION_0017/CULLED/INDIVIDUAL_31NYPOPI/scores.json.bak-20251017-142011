  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but replaces several TRUTH functional forms with common alternates and adds an explicit light/photoacclimation module. Uptake/growth are Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer average), rather than the TRUTH functional form a/(b + c*P) combined with N/(e+N). Grazing is Holling type II (P/(K_P + P)) instead of the TRUTH Hill-like P^2/(mu^2 + P^2). Phytoplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms (candidate) vs linear in TRUTH. Zooplankton growth is from assimilated grazing (candidate) rather than the TRUTH P^2-dependent functional response; zooplankton mortality is quadratic (candidate) vs linear (TRUTH). The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt and dP/dt that exists in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and k*P), and it introduces extra ecological detail: explicit light attenuation with self-shading and a dynamic chlorophyll-to-carbon state (photoacclimation).",
