  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a mechanistic NPZ core with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake co-limited by an explicit light module and Holling-type grazing, plus mortality closures that include quadratic density dependence. Several key ecological processes from the TRUTH model are present but in alternate mathematical forms (e.g., Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake vs TRUTH's N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) structure; Holling II grazing vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Crucially, the candidate omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms for nutrients and phytoplankton that are present in TRUTH. The candidate also adds an explicit light attenuation calculation (Beer\u2013Lambert averaging) and a dynamic chlorophyll-to-carbon (photoacclimation) state variable, which are not present in the TRUTH NPZ.",
