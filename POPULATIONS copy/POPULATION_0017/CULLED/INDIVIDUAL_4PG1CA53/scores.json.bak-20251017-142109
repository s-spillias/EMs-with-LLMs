  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ model that preserves the core three-state structure (N, P, Z) and includes the main ecological fluxes: nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, and recycling from mortality and inefficient assimilation. However, many process formulations differ from the TRUTH model: uptake is split into separate Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation \u00d7 an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert average in the mixed layer) rather than the TRUTH combined N/(e+N) \u00d7 (a/(b + c*P)) form; grazing is a Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form; mortality and sinking are represented differently (candidate includes linear mortality plus a quadratic aggregation/sinking term with partial recycling xi). Several extra ecological modifiers appear (temperature/Q10 scaling, explicit light attenuation, and variable assimilation efficiency that depends on nutrient status). Some canonical TRUTH terms are missing in the candidate (notably the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N) and an explicit linear phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss). Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but often via alternate, literature-recognized formulations and adds several mechanistic components not present in the TRUTH NPZ.",
