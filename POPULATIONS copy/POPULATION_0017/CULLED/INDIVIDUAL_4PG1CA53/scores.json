  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ dynamical model with uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling terms, but it uses different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model for most processes. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation co-limited by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert average light) rather than the TRUTH factor a/(b + c*P). Grazing is Holling type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form. Non\u2011grazing phytoplankton mortality includes a linear term that matches TRUTH, but the candidate also adds a quadratic aggregation/sinking loss and explicit recycling fraction. Zooplankton growth is assimilation\u00d7grazing (with assimilation efficiency variable and dependent on nutrient status) and mortality is quadratic (density-dependent), whereas TRUTH uses a linear zooplankton loss. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in N, P and Z analogous to TRUTH's k*(N0 - N) or (s+k)*P. The candidate also introduces several extra ecological components not present in TRUTH (explicit light attenuation & mixed-layer averaging, Q10 temperature scaling, variable assimilation efficiency, and quadratic aggregation/sinking with an explicit recycling fraction).",
