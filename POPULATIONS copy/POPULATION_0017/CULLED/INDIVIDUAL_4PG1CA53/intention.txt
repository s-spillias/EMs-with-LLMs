MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== Current Model Evaluation ===

The current NPZ model includes several sophisticated features:
1. Light limitation with self-shading (Beer-Lambert law)
2. Temperature effects via Q10 formulation on growth, grazing, and mortality
3. Nutrient recycling from multiple pathways (mortality, sinking, grazing inefficiency)
4. Density-dependent processes (phytoplankton aggregation, zooplankton mortality)

However, the model assumes constant zooplankton assimilation efficiency (e = 0.3), which is ecologically unrealistic.

=== Identified Gap ===

In natural systems, phytoplankton nutritional quality varies with nutrient availability. When nutrients are abundant, phytoplankton have balanced C:N:P ratios and are highly nutritious. Under nutrient limitation, phytoplankton accumulate carbon-rich compounds (lipids, carbohydrates) while protein synthesis is reduced, leading to high C:N ratios and poor food quality for zooplankton.

This stoichiometric effect has major consequences:
- Nutrient-stressed phytoplankton support lower zooplankton growth
- Zooplankton excrete more nutrients when feeding on poor-quality food
- This creates a feedback: nutrient limitation → poor phytoplankton quality → reduced grazing pressure → potential phytoplankton accumulation

=== Proposed Improvement ===

Implement VARIABLE ZOOPLANKTON ASSIMILATION EFFICIENCY based on phytoplankton nutrient status.

Mathematical formulation:
e_effective = e_min + (e_max - e_min) * f_nutrient

where:
- e_min = minimum assimilation efficiency (nutrient-stressed phytoplankton)
- e_max = maximum assimilation efficiency (nutrient-replete phytoplankton)
- f_nutrient = nutrient limitation factor already calculated (N / (K_N + N))

This creates a mechanistic link between nutrient availability and trophic transfer efficiency.

Ecological justification:
1. Well-supported by stoichiometric theory (Sterner & Elser 2002)
2. Observed in laboratory and field studies
3. Creates realistic feedback: nutrient depletion → poor food quality → reduced grazing efficiency → more nutrient excretion
4. Helps explain bloom dynamics and nutrient recycling patterns

Parameter changes:
- Replace single parameter 'e' with 'e_min' and 'e_max'
- e_min: 0.1-0.2 (typical for nutrient-stressed phytoplankton)
- e_max: 0.4-0.6 (typical for nutrient-replete phytoplankton)
- Original e = 0.3 falls within this range, suggesting intermediate quality

Expected model behavior:
- During nutrient-replete conditions: high grazing efficiency, strong top-down control
- During nutrient limitation: reduced grazing efficiency, more nutrient recycling, potential for phytoplankton accumulation despite grazing
- More realistic representation of bloom termination and nutrient cycling

This modification adds ecological realism without excessive complexity, using an existing calculated term (nutrient limitation) to modulate a key process rate.
