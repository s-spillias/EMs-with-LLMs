Key Observation:                                                                                                                                                                                                            

The model uses quadratic (density-dependent) mortality for zooplankton (m_Z * Z_prev * Z_prev) but linear mortality for phytoplankton (m_P * P_prev). This asymmetry may not capture realistic phytoplankton dynamics,      
especially at high densities where:

Ecological Justification for Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                   

Phytoplankton mortality should also exhibit density-dependence. At low densities, mortality is primarily from background processes (senescence, dilution). At high densities, density-dependent processes dominate (viral   
transmission, aggregation-enhanced sinking, nutrient stress in dense patches). This is particularly important for bloom dynamics in the oceanic mixed layer context.                                                        

Proposed Change:                                                                                                                                                                                                            

Add a density-dependent (quadratic) component to phytoplankton mortality while retaining a linear baseline. This creates a more realistic mortality structure: m_P_linear * P + m_P_quad * P^2                              

This improvement:

 • Provides symmetry with zooplankton mortality structure

 +Phytoplankton mortality should include density-dependent processes:                                                                                                                                                       
 +                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 +1. VIRAL LYSIS: Virus-host contact rates increase quadratically with host density, leading to epidemic-style mortality during blooms

 +2. AGGREGATION AND SINKING: At high phytoplankton densities, cells aggregate more frequently, forming larger particles that sink faster out of the mixed layer

 +3. SELF-TOXICITY: Dense phytoplankton populations can experience allelopathic effects and nutrient micro-depletion in patches

 +4. BLOOM COLLAPSE DYNAMICS: Observed phytoplankton blooms often collapse rapidly, which is better captured by density-dependent mortality than linear mortality alone
