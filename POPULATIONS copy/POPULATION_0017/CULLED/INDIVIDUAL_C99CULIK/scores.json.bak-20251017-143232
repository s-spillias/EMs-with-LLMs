  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core ecological roles of the TRUTH NPZ: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from mortalities and unassimilated grazing, phytoplankton growth and grazing losses, phytoplankton mortality, and zooplankton growth and mortality. However, the functional forms differ in many places (candidate uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term co-limited by an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light module and a Holling type II grazer, whereas TRUTH uses a different P-dependent modifier a/(b+cP) and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing kernel). The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/dilution term (k*(N0 - N) present in TRUTH). The candidate also adds an explicit light attenuation / mixed-layer averaging calculation (Beer\u2013Lambert self-shading) which is not present in the TRUTH model.",
