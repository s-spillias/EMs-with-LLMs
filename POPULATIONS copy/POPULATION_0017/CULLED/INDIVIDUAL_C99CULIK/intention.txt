MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system with light limitation and nutrient recycling. It includes:
- Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake with light co-limitation
- Holling Type II grazing response
- Light attenuation with phytoplankton self-shading (Beer-Lambert law)
- Nutrient recycling from mortality

IDENTIFIED ASYMMETRY:
The model currently uses:
- LINEAR mortality for phytoplankton: m_P * P
- QUADRATIC (density-dependent) mortality for zooplankton: m_Z * Z^2

This asymmetry may not adequately capture phytoplankton bloom dynamics, particularly bloom collapse.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Phytoplankton mortality should include density-dependent processes:

1. VIRAL LYSIS: Virus-host contact rates increase quadratically with host density, leading to epidemic-style mortality during blooms

2. AGGREGATION AND SINKING: At high phytoplankton densities, cells aggregate more frequently, forming larger particles that sink faster out of the mixed layer

3. SELF-TOXICITY: Dense phytoplankton populations can experience allelopathic effects and nutrient micro-depletion in patches

4. BLOOM COLLAPSE DYNAMICS: Observed phytoplankton blooms often collapse rapidly, which is better captured by density-dependent mortality than linear mortality alone

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
Replace linear phytoplankton mortality with a mixed linear-quadratic form:
- OLD: m_P * P
- NEW: m_P_linear * P + m_P_quad * P^2

Where:
- m_P_linear: baseline mortality rate (senescence, background viral lysis, dilution) [day^-1]
- m_P_quad: density-dependent mortality coefficient (epidemic viral lysis, aggregation-enhanced sinking) [day^-1 (g C m^-3)^-1]

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Better representation of bloom collapse dynamics
2. More realistic phytoplankton population regulation at high densities
3. Improved symmetry with zooplankton mortality structure
4. Enhanced ability to capture rapid transitions in phytoplankton biomass

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- m_P_linear: 0.05 day^-1 (lower than original m_P to account for separation of processes)
- m_P_quad: 0.1 day^-1 (g C m^-3)^-1 (similar magnitude to m_Z for consistency)

This modification maintains model parsimony (adds only one parameter) while significantly improving ecological realism for the oceanic mixed layer plankton dynamics context.
