  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling, phytoplankton mortality and zooplankton growth) using common alternate functional forms (Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, Monod-style light limitation, Holling Type II grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, and quadratic zooplankton mortality). It does not include an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients or phytoplankton like the TRUTH model's k*(N0 - N) and (s + k)*P. The candidate also adds explicit ecological processes not present in TRUTH: an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation + mixed-layer averaged irradiance calculation and Q10 temperature scaling applied to multiple rates.",
