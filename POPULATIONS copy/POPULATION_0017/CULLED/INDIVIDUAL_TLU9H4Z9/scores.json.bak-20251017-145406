  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the canonical roles present (uptake-driven phytoplankton growth, grazing-mediated transfers, recycling, and zooplankton growth and mortality), but it does not replicate the TRUTH model algebra exactly. The candidate uses Monod/Michaelis-Menten style nutrient uptake combined with an explicit light-limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert averaged over a mixed layer) and Q10 temperature scaling. Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH Holling-Type-III-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2). Recycling is represented via unassimilated grazing (1-e)*grazing and mortality-dependent recycling, rather than the TRUTH's specific beta*lambda_*predation and gamma*q*Z terms. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations that exists in TRUTH.",
