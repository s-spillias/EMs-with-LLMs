  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard discrete-time NPZ with Monod nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling type II grazing, assimilation efficiency, linear zooplankton mortality, and an explicit quadratic (density-dependent) phytoplankton mortality term. It differs from the TRUTH NPZ which uses a more complex phytoplankton growth term (nutrient Monod times a P-dependent light/shading factor), Holling type III (sigmoidal) grazing, explicit mixing/entrainment for N and P, and separate recycling fractions (alpha, beta, gamma). The candidate therefore matches many ecological roles but uses alternate functional forms (Monod uptake, Holling II grazing, quadratic mortality) and omits mixing terms present in TRUTH.",
