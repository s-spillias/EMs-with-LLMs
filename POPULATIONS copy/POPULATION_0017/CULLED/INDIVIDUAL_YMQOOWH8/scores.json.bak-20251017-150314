  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth with assimilation efficiency, recycling from mortality and unassimilated grazing, and linear zooplankton mortality). However, the functional forms differ from the TRUTH model in several places: the candidate uses Monod/Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake and Holling Type II grazing (vs. TRUTH's Hill-type grazing P^2/(mu^2+P^2) and a more complex uptake factor), and it omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH. The candidate also includes an explicit density-dependent quadratic phytoplankton mortality term not present in TRUTH. Numerically, the candidate uses a discrete-time Euler-style update rather than continuous ODEs.",
