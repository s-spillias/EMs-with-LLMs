  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a classic discrete-time NPZ with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Michaelis-Menten on N), Holling type-II grazing, linear mortalities, and immediate recycling of mortality and unassimilated grazing back to the nutrient pool. Compared with the TRUTH model, the candidate omits the TRUTH's second limitation term on phytoplankton growth (a/(b + c*P) \u2014 a light or self-shading term), uses a Holling II grazing function instead of the TRUTH's sigmoidal (P^2/(mu^2+P^2), i.e. type-III) grazing, and it does not include the TRUTH environmental mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N) for nutrients (nor an explicit mixing loss for P). The candidate uses an Euler-style discrete update (dt factors) and contains an observation model (likelihood) and numerical safeguards, which are modelling/estimation implementation details rather than new ecological processes.",
