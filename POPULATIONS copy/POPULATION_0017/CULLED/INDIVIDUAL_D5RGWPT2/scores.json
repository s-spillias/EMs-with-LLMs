  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same three-state NPZ structure (N, P, Z) and includes uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling terms, but many functional forms differ from the TRUTH reference. Uptake and growth are implemented as Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert average over mixed layer) and temperature scaling (Q10). Grazing is Holling type\u2011II and zooplankton growth uses a food\u2011dependent assimilation efficiency (variable e), whereas TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Holling\u2011III / sigmoidal) predation kernel and constant assimilation. The candidate also lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients of the form k*(N0-N) and lacks explicit mixing terms for P and Z. Several extra ecological processes appear (temperature/Q10 scaling, explicit light attenuation & mixed layer averaging, food\u2011dependent assimilation efficiency, substrate\u2011dependent recycling efficiency, explicit partial recycling from sinking aggregates).",
