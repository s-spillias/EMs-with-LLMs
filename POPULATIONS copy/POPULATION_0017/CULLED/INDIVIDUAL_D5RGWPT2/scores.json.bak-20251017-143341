  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ-style model with the same core trophic flows (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth; grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth; recycling from mortality/excretion). However the functional forms differ in many places: the candidate uses an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light module and a Monod nutrient term multiplied by an explicit light limitation (rather than TRUTH's simple P-dependent term a/(b + c*P)). The candidate also adds temperature (Q10) scaling, food-dependent assimilation efficiency, substrate-dependent recycling efficiency, and quadratic aggregation / quadratic zooplankton mortality. The candidate therefore matches the ecological roles but in alternate mathematical forms for most canonical components; it omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and the (s+k)*P mixing loss).",
