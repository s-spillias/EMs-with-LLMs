  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, recycling, and zooplankton growth/mortality) but uses different mathematical choices than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited multiplied by an explicit Steele light limitation (photo\u2011inhibition) rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N) times a P-dependent denominator. Grazing is implemented as Holling type II (P/(K_P+P)) instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form. Recycling is present (from phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton mortality and unassimilated grazing) but there is no explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the candidate (TRUTH had k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P). The candidate adds explicit light physics (Beer\u2013Lambert self-shading, mixed-layer averaging and Steele photoinhibition) and quadratic mortality terms that are not in TRUTH. Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and maps to standard alternates in the literature, but it is not a line-by-line algebraic match to the TRUTH NPZ.",
