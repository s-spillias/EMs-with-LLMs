Key Observation:                                                                                                                                                                                                            

The model includes light limitation through average light in the mixed layer, but this is calculated using a relatively simple approach. The current implementation uses Beer-Lambert attenuation but doesn't account for   
photoinhibition at high light intensities, which is a well-documented phenomenon in phytoplankton ecology.                                                                                                                  

Proposed Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                       

Add photoinhibition to the light limitation term. At very high light intensities (especially near the surface), phytoplankton can experience photodamage that reduces growth rates. This is particularly important in       
shallow mixed layers or high-light conditions. The current model uses a simple Michaelis-Menten saturation curve for light, but a more realistic formulation would include both light limitation at low intensities AND     
photoinhibition at high intensities.                                                                                                                                                                                        

I'll implement a Steele (1962) or Platt et al. (1980) photosynthesis-irradiance curve that captures both light limitation and photoinhibition. This uses an exponential formulation that peaks at an optimal light intensity
and decreases at higher intensities.
