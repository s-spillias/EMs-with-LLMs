  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth -> grazing -> zooplankton growth -> recycling) but uses different functional forms in several places compared with the TRUTH Python model. Uptake is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation computed from Beer\u2013Lambert self\u2011shading (an alternate to TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) factor). Grazing is Holling Type II (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Phytoplankton mortality is linear (matches TRUTH), but zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density dependent) rather than TRUTH's linear loss. The candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (TRUTH has k*(N0-N) and -(s+k)*P). The candidate also includes an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert mixed\u2011layer light attenuation calculation (extra ecological process relative to TRUTH) and modeling-related extras (observation errors and soft parameter penalties). Overall many ecological roles are present and map to TRUTH or known alternates, but mixing losses are missing and some functional forms differ.",
