  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a biologically plausible NPZ with the same three state variables (N, P, Z) and includes core processes: nutrient-limited phytoplankton uptake, grazing-driven zooplankton growth with assimilation efficiency, mortality terms and recycling. However the functional forms differ in several places from the TRUTH model. The candidate uses a classical Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation computed from a Beer\u2013Lambert mixed\u2011layer integral (an ecological process not present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling type II (candidate) versus a saturating P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form (TRUTH). Zooplankton mortality is density\u2011dependent (quadratic) in the candidate rather than linear in the TRUTH. The candidate also omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and the P mixing/sinking term that exist in TRUTH.",
