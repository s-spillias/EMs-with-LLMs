  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the core trophic flows (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton \u2192 zooplankton) and nutrient recycling, but it differs in functional choices and omits physical mixing. Uptake/growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit light limitation (an explicit f(I) not present in TRUTH). Grazing is a Holling Type II (candidate) vs a Type-III-like / quadratic-saturating predation in TRUTH. Phytoplankton non\u2011grazing mortality is present as linear in both models, but the candidate lacks the TRUTH mixing/entrainment terms for N and P and adds a quadratic, density\u2011dependent zooplankton mortality term as an extra ecological process. The candidate also parameterizes recycling from grazing explicitly via assimilation efficiency and uses recycling from both grazing inefficiency and zooplankton mortality.",
