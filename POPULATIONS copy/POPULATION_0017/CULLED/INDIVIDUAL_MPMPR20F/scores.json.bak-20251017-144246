  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-mediated zooplankton growth with assimilation efficiency, recycling from mortality/excretion, and phytoplankton mortality) but it uses alternate functional forms relative to the TRUTH Python NPZ. Specifically: nutrient uptake/growth is a standard Monod/ Michaelis\u2013Menten form (r * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the two-factor form used in TRUTH (N/(e+N) * a/(b+cP) * P); grazing is Holling type II (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) rather than the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH; zooplankton mortality is density-dependent quadratic (m_Z * Z^2) rather than linear (q * Z) in TRUTH; the candidate explicitly includes recycling from unassimilated grazing (1-e)*grazing and from zooplankton mortality, but it omits an environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and mixing losses for P). The candidate also adds non-ecological modeling components (soft parameter constraints/penalties and numerical safeguards). Overall the model is ecologically plausible and matches many canonical alternatives from the literature, but it is not a direct structural match to the TRUTH equations and it is missing the mixing/entrainment term.",
