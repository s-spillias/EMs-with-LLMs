NPZ Plankton Ecosystem Model

This model simulates the coupled dynamics of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z) in the oceanic mixed layer. The model captures the following ecological processes:

1. NUTRIENT DYNAMICS: Nutrients are depleted by phytoplankton uptake and replenished through remineralization of dead organic matter and zooplankton excretion. Nutrient limitation follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics to represent saturation at high nutrient concentrations.

2. PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMICS: Phytoplankton grow through photosynthesis using available nutrients, with growth limited by nutrient availability via a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) function. Phytoplankton experience natural mortality and are consumed by zooplankton through a Type II functional response (Holling disc equation), which accounts for handling time and saturation at high prey densities.

3. ZOOPLANKTON DYNAMICS: Zooplankton grow by consuming phytoplankton with a conversion efficiency less than 1 (accounting for metabolic costs and incomplete assimilation). They experience density-dependent mortality that increases quadratically with zooplankton biomass, representing predation by higher trophic levels and intraspecific competition.

4. NUTRIENT RECYCLING: The model includes closed nutrient cycling where a fraction of phytoplankton mortality and zooplankton losses return nutrients to the dissolved pool, maintaining ecosystem productivity.

The model uses biologically realistic functional forms including saturating uptake kinetics, Type II functional responses for grazing, and density-dependent mortality. Small constants are added to prevent numerical instabilities, and the model is designed to capture oscillatory dynamics commonly observed in plankton systems.
