  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Michaelis\u2013Menten), a Holling-type II grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and recycling of mortality back to nutrients via a single recycling fraction. It therefore contains the main ecological roles (uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling, zooplankton growth via assimilation), but several structural differences from the TRUTH model are important: (1) uptake lacks the TRUTH model's second limitation factor (the a/(b + c*P) term), (2) grazing functional form differs (candidate: P/(K_P + P) vs TRUTH: P^2/(mu^2 + P^2)), (3) recycling in the candidate is only from explicit mortalities (gamma*(P_mortality + Z_mortality)) and does not include explicit recycling from grazing or a separate mixing/enrichment term, and (4) the candidate omits the environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N)) present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate maps to recognized alternate formulations (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling II grazing, linear P mortality, quadratic Z mortality, recycling from mortality) but is not a term-by-term match to the TRUTH NPZ.",

TRUTH: \"(N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P\" includes an additional P-dependent factor (a/(b + c*P)) that the candidate omits, so it is an alternate Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake rather than a TRUTH match."
