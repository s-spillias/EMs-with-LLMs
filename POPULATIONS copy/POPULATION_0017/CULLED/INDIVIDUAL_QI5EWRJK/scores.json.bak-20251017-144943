  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements all three state derivatives (N,P,Z) and the standard ecological roles (uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) but many terms are implemented with alternate functional forms. Uptake is a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term combined with an explicit light limitation (averaged Beer\u2013Lambert) via a flexible power-mean co-limitation (theta) rather than the exact multiplicative form in TRUTH. Grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturation. Recycling is present but formulated as (1 - e_effective)*grazing + delta*Z_mortality plus separate recycling from sinking and mortality, rather than the exact beta/lambda/q terms in TRUTH. Importantly, the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (no k*(N0 - N) analogue). The candidate also adds several processes not in TRUTH (temperature Q10 scaling, explicit light attenuation and mixed-layer averaging, flexible co-limitation exponent, food-dependent assimilation efficiency, explicit fraction recycled from sinking aggregates). Overall, the candidate is ecologically plausible and matches many alternate formulations in the literature, but it is not a one-to-one match with the TRUTH equations.",
