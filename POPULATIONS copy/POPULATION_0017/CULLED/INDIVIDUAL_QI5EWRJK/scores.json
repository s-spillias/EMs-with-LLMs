  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ dynamics core with all three state variables and plausible uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling pathways, but uses different mathematical choices than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake/growth is implemented as Monod/Michaelis-Menten style nutrient and light limitation combined with a flexible power-mean co-limitation (theta) rather than the TRUTH-specific (N/(e+N)) * (a/(b + c*P)) form. Grazing is Holling type II in the candidate (g_max * P/(K_P + P)) while TRUTH uses a saturating Type-III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). Recycling from zooplankton appears (mortality + assimilation inefficiency) but there is no environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients or plankton in the candidate (TRUTH had k*(N0 - N) and k in P losses). The candidate also adds several extra processes not present in TRUTH: explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation with self-shading and mixed-layer averaging, temperature scaling via Q10 on rates, a food-dependent (P-dependent) assimilation efficiency, and quadratic aggregation and quadratic zooplankton mortality formulations. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles in TRUTH but via alternate, literature-supported formulations in most cases; environmental mixing present in TRUTH is missing in the candidate.",
