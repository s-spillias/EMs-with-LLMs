  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, recycling, zooplankton growth and losses) but uses different functional forms and adds several processes not present in the TRUTH reference. Uptake/growth are implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert average light), rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b+cP)) * P factor. Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P))*Z rather than the TRUTH Type-III P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z. Recycling from grazing, respiration and mortality is explicitly partitioned (e, 1-e, beta, delta, xi). The candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N) and replaces TRUTH's linear sinking (s*P) with a quadratic aggregation/sinking P^2 term. The candidate also explicitly includes temperature scaling (Q10) and light attenuation (Beer\u2013Lambert average over mixed layer) as ecological modifiers.",
