  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure but uses different functional forms for several processes. Phytoplankton uptake/growth is formulated as Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicitly computed light limitation (depth-averaged irradiance with self-shading). Grazing is Holling type II; phytoplankton mortality is linear (matches TRUTH), but zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) rather than linear. Nutrient recycling is present via recycling fractions, excretion (1 - e) * grazing, and mortality recycling, but the candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but uses alternates for uptake, light limitation and grazing, and omits mixing in N and P. A notable extra ecological component is the explicit mixed-layer light attenuation / depth-averaged irradiance calculation (self-shading by P), which is not present in the TRUTH NPZ code.",
