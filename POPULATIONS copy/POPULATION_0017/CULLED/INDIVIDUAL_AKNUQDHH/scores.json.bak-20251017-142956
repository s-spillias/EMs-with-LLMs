  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth -> grazing -> zooplankton growth -> recycling) but uses simpler/alternate functional forms in several places compared to the TRUTH model. Uptake is a single Monod/Michaelis-Menten term (no explicit light-dependent denominator term present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling type II (saturating in P) rather than the TRUTH model's sigmoidal (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) Type-III form. The candidate explicitly splits recycling into a fast excretion term (fraction of grazing) and slower recycling from mortality, similar in role to TRUTH's beta/gamma terms but implemented differently. The candidate lacks an environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (no k*(N0-N) analog) and also omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking loss term. Zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density dependent) rather than the TRUTH linear loss. Overall: same ecological roles are present, but several terms are alternate formulations and the mixing term present in TRUTH is missing in the candidate.",
