  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ structure with the main ecological roles present (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling/excretion, and mortality). However the functional forms differ from the TRUTH model in important ways: the candidate uses a simple Michaelis-Menten (Monod) nutrient limitation and a Holling type-II grazing (g*P/(K_P+P)) while TRUTH uses a compound nutrient+light limitation for uptake (N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) * P) and a Holling-type III grazing (P^2/(mu^2 + P^2)). The candidate includes an explicit fast excretion term (fraction of grazing) and an explicit quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality, which is not present in TRUTH. Crucially, the candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and for P and Z (mixing/entrainment terms in TRUTH), so physical mixing is not represented in the candidate model.",
