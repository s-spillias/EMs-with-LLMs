  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ-like closure but departs from the TRUTH NPZ in key mechanistic choices. Both models have nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth and grazing-driven zooplankton growth plus recycling, but the candidate uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit light limitation and Q10 temperature scaling (TRUTH used a different P-dependent inhibition term a/(b + c*P) and no explicit light or Q10). Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II with a food-dependent assimilation efficiency, whereas TRUTH uses a Type-III (P^2/(mu^2 + P^2)) functional response. The candidate also adds explicit photoacclimation (light-dependent K_N), light attenuation / self-shading, Q10 temperature modifiers, food-dependent assimilation efficiency, and quadratic aggregation and zooplankton mortality terms that are not present in the TRUTH code. Several TRUTH terms are absent (notably the explicit mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N) for nutrients and the linear mixing loss on P).",
