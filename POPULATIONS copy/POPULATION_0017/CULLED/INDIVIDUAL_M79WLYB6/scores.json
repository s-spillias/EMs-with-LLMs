  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ-style model that contains the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth and grazing, zooplankton growth and mortality, recycling) but uses different mathematical forms and many additional processes compared with the TRUTH Python NPZ. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are written as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert averaged over a mixed layer) and temperature Q10 scaling (alternate forms relative to TRUTH). Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH quadratic/P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form; zooplankton growth uses a food-dependent assimilation efficiency (variable e_effective) rather than a constant fraction. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH's nutrient equation (k*(N0 - N)) and omits physical mixing losses in the P and Z equations. The candidate adds multiple extra ecological mechanisms (temperature Q10 scaling, explicit light attenuation & photoacclimation, food-dependent assimilation efficiency, quadratic aggregation/sinking with partial recycling, quadratic zooplankton mortality).",
