  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ ecological roles but uses different mathematical choices in several places. Phytoplankton growth is represented as a product of a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (N/(K_N+N)), an explicit light-limitation factor computed from depth-averaged irradiance, and biomass (r_T * N_limitation * L * P). Grazing and zooplankton growth are present as a Holling type II functional response (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) with assimilation efficiency e feeding zooplankton growth. Phytoplankton mortality is linear (m_P * P) matching the TRUTH structure, but zooplankton mortality is implemented as density-dependent quadratic mortality (m_Z * Z^2) rather than the TRUTH linear loss. Important omissions relative to TRUTH: there is no explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the candidate dN/dt or dP/dt (TRUTH had k*(N0 - N) and a mixing contribution to phytoplankton loss). Extra processes in the candidate that are not in TRUTH include explicit temperature dependence (Q10 scaling of rates) and an explicit light attenuation / mixed-layer averaging calculation producing the light-limitation factor (I_0, k_w, k_c, H, I_k).",
