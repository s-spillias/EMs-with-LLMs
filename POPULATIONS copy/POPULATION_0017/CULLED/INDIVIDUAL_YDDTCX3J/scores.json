  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard Monod/Holling-II NPZ structure with explicit light attenuation and temperature (Q10) scaling. Key ecological processes are present (nutrient-limited growth, grazing, mortality, recycling), but several formulations differ from the TRUTH model: nutrient uptake is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) multiplied by an explicit light-saturation factor (candidate) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) form; grazing is Holling type II in the candidate versus the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form; zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) here versus linear in TRUTH. Critically, the candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient equation (k*(N0 - N)) and physical mixing losses in the P and Z equations. The candidate also includes two clear additional ecological mechanisms not in TRUTH: explicit light attenuation / depth-averaged irradiance (self-shading) and temperature dependence via Q10 scaling of rates.",
