MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing NPZ model captures the basic trophic interactions in the oceanic mixed layer:
- Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton (Michaelis-Menten kinetics)
- Zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II functional response)
- Nutrient recycling from mortality
- Density-dependent zooplankton mortality

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The model lacks light limitation, which is a critical factor in oceanic mixed layer dynamics. 
Phytoplankton growth in surface waters is typically co-limited by both nutrients AND light.
The current formulation (uptake = r * N/(K_N + N) * P) only considers nutrient limitation.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
In the oceanic mixed layer, light availability decreases with depth due to:
1. Absorption and scattering by water molecules
2. Self-shading by phytoplankton biomass (Beer-Lambert law)

At high phytoplankton densities, self-shading becomes significant and limits further growth,
creating a natural carrying capacity effect. This is especially important given the updated
literature value for r (1.0 day⁻¹), which represents fast-growing phytoplankton that can
quickly deplete light in the mixed layer.

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Added a light limitation factor: L = exp(-k_w * z - k_c * P * z)
where:
- k_w = background light attenuation by water (m⁻¹)
- k_c = specific light attenuation by phytoplankton (m² (g C)⁻¹)
- z = mixed layer depth (m)
- P = phytoplankton concentration (g C m⁻³)

The phytoplankton growth term becomes:
uptake = r * [N/(K_N + N)] * L * P

This creates a multiplicative limitation where growth requires BOTH nutrients and light.

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
1. More realistic bloom dynamics with self-limiting growth
2. Prevention of unrealistic exponential phytoplankton growth
3. Emergence of optimal phytoplankton density balancing nutrient uptake and light availability
4. Better representation of seasonal and depth-dependent productivity patterns
5. Improved model stability and realism for oceanic mixed layer conditions

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- k_w: Background water light attenuation (typical range: 0.02-0.2 m⁻¹)
- k_c: Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (typical range: 0.01-0.1 m² (g C)⁻¹)
- z: Mixed layer depth (typical range: 10-100 m, often 20-50 m)

These parameters are well-constrained in oceanographic literature and add minimal complexity
while significantly improving ecological realism.
