  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the major ecological roles present in the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton with nutrient and light limitation, grazing-driven zooplankton growth with assimilation, recycling to nutrients, and phytoplankton non-grazing mortality). However the functional forms differ in several places: nutrient and light limitation use Michaelis\u2013Menten \u00d7 Beer\u2013Lambert (candidate) versus TRUTH's N/(e+N) \u00d7 a/(b + c P) form; grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate vs a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form in TRUTH; zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) in the candidate vs linear in TRUTH. Critically, the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton present in the TRUTH model (k*(N0 - N) and the mixing loss for P). The candidate also contains practical modeling extras (observation-error likelihood, soft parameter penalties, Euler forward integration) that are not ecological processes.",
