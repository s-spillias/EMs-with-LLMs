  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the same high-level compartments (N, P, Z) and the same broad set of processes (uptake-driven phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, recycling from mortality and unassimilated grazing). However the mathematical formulations differ in many places: uptake is a product of Monod-type nutrient limitation and an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer average) rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N) \u00d7 (a/(b + c P)) \u00d7 P form; grazing is Holling type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) (type-III-like); zooplankton assimilation efficiency is dynamic (depends on food quality and specific feeding rate) vs. constant alpha in TRUTH; zooplankton mortality and phytoplankton aggregation are quadratic density-dependent rather than linear terms in TRUTH; and the candidate omits an explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term analogous to TRUTH's k*(N0 - N). The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) scaling and an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light module \u2014 both absent in TRUTH.",

TRUTH uses a similar nutrient Monod factor N/(e+N) but multiplies by a different P-dependent term (a/(b + c*P) * P). The candidate is therefore an alternate (Monod \u00d7 explicit light) formulation rather than exact TRUTH match."
