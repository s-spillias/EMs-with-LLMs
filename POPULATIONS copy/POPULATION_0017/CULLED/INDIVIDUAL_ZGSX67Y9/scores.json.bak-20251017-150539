  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure but uses different functional forms and adds environmental modifiers. Phytoplankton growth is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation term (Beer\u2013Lambert averaged over the mixed layer). Grazing is Holling type II and zooplankton growth is proportional to assimilated grazing. Recycling is present from phytoplankton mortality and from zooplankton (mortality + unassimilated grazing). The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing (entrainment/dilution) term present in TRUTH and replaces TRUTH's linear zooplankton mortality with a quadratic density\u2011dependent mortality. The candidate also adds explicit light attenuation/self\u2011shading and temperature (Q10) scaling \u2014 processes not present in the TRUTH NPZ formulation.",
