MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system with light and nutrient co-limitation, 
Holling Type II grazing, mixed linear-quadratic phytoplankton mortality, and nutrient recycling. The light 
limitation includes self-shading effects through the Beer-Lambert law.

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The model lacks temperature dependence of biological rates. Temperature is a fundamental driver of metabolic 
processes in marine ecosystems and affects:
1. Phytoplankton photosynthesis and growth rates
2. Zooplankton grazing and metabolic rates
3. Mortality and decomposition rates
4. Nutrient remineralization rates

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Temperature controls enzymatic reaction rates and metabolic processes across all trophic levels. In oceanic 
systems, seasonal temperature variations (5-25째C typical range) can cause 2-4 fold changes in biological 
rates. Different processes have different temperature sensitivities (Q10 values):
- Phytoplankton growth: Q10 ~ 1.5-2.5 (moderate sensitivity)
- Zooplankton grazing: Q10 ~ 2.0-3.0 (higher sensitivity, metabolic process)
- Mortality/decomposition: Q10 ~ 2.0-2.5 (moderate-high sensitivity)

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
Add temperature-dependent rate modulation using Q10 formulation:
  rate(T) = rate(T_ref) * Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)

Where:
- T is the current temperature (째C)
- T_ref is the reference temperature where base rates are defined (typically 15-20째C)
- Q10 is the factor by which rate changes with 10째C temperature increase

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
1. Add temperature as a time-varying environmental driver (DATA_VECTOR)
2. Add Q10 parameters for different process groups:
   - Q10_growth: for phytoplankton growth rate (r)
   - Q10_grazing: for zooplankton grazing rate (g_max)
   - Q10_mortality: for mortality rates (m_P, m_P2, m_Z)
3. Add reference temperature parameter (T_ref)
4. Apply temperature scaling to relevant rate parameters before calculating process rates

EXPECTED BENEFITS:
- Captures seasonal dynamics driven by temperature variation
- Allows model to represent different thermal regimes (polar, temperate, tropical)
- Improves realism without adding excessive complexity
- Maintains interpretability (Q10 values have clear biological meaning)
- Can be validated against temperature-dependent rate measurements from literature

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
For each temperature-sensitive process, multiply the base rate by the temperature factor:
  r_effective = r * Q10_growth^((T - T_ref)/10)
  g_max_effective = g_max * Q10_grazing^((T - T_ref)/10)
  m_P_effective = m_P * Q10_mortality^((T - T_ref)/10)
  m_P2_effective = m_P2 * Q10_mortality^((T - T_ref)/10)
  m_Z_effective = m_Z * Q10_mortality^((T - T_ref)/10)

This maintains the existing model structure while adding environmental realism.
