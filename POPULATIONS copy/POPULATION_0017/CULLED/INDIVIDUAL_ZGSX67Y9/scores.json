  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth and mortality) but uses different functional forms for several processes and adds explicit temperature and light modules. Uptake and growth are multiplicative nutrient-Michaelis-Menten \u00d7 light-saturation (an alternate to the TRUTH's N/(e+N) \u00d7 a/(b + cP) form). Grazing is Holling Type II (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response). Recycling is present but partitioned differently (grazing inefficiency + mortality recycling). Important omissions relative to TRUTH: an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and for phytoplankton is absent. Extra ecological structure includes an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer light calculation and Q10 temperature scaling on rates (neither present in TRUTH). Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and matches the roles in TRUTH, but several functional forms differ (mostly ALTERNATE) and mixing is missing for N and P.",
