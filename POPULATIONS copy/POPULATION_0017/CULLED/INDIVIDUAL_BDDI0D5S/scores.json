  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ forward model with the same three state variables (N, P, Z) and the same high-level processes (uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality), but it uses different functional forms and adds several processes not present in the TRUTH script. Uptake/growth in the candidate is implemented as a classical Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient term multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert averaged over a mixed layer) and a Q10 temperature modifier \u2014 this differs from the TRUTH nutrient-limited uptake (N/(e+N) \u00d7 a/(b + c P) \u00d7 P). Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) and zooplankton growth is e*grazing, while TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Hill coefficient 2 / Type-III-like) functional form. The candidate adds explicit temperature (Q10) scaling, explicit light attenuation and mixing-depth averaging, a food-dependent starvation mortality for zooplankton, an explicit quadratic aggregation term for phytoplankton (and an explicit fraction xi for recycling from sinking), and soft-constraints/likelihood machinery for parameter estimation. In short: same roles are present but many functional forms are ALTERNATE; mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH are missing in the candidate; several extra ecological process parameterizations are added (temperature, explicit light attenuation, food-dependent starvation, sinking-recycling xi).",
