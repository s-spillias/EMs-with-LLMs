  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements the canonical NPZ processes (uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality) but with several alternate mathematical choices and some omissions relative to the TRUTH Python NPZ. Uptake in the candidate is a standard Michaelis-Menten (Monod) nutrient term multiplied by an explicit light-limitation factor (Beer\u2013Lambert averaged over a mixed layer), whereas the TRUTH uptake uses N/(e+N) times a/(b + c*P) (a different co-limitation/shading factor). Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)), while TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. Recycling is present but structured differently (unassimilated grazing + mortality-based recycling vs TRUTH's predation-return and mortality recycling terms). Important omissions: the candidate does not include an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt (TRUTH had k*(N0 - N)) and does not include the (s + k) mixing loss in dP/dt. Extra processes in the candidate include an explicit light module (Beer\u2013Lambert + mixed layer averaging) and density-dependent quadratic mortality terms for P and Z. Also note possible parameter-name collisions (e.g., 'r' and 'e' mean different things between models) which complicate 1:1 mapping.",
