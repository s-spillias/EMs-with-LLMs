  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling back to nutrients, and mortality closures) but uses alternate functional forms relative to the TRUTH Python model. Most ecological roles are present but realized with different families: Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake with an explicit light co-limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer averaging) instead of the TRUTH\u2019s N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) form; Holling Type II grazing instead of the TRUTH\u2019s P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating grazing; density-dependent quadratic zooplankton mortality instead of linear zooplankton loss in TRUTH. Crucially, the candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing (entrainment/dilution) term present in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and k*P in P equation). The candidate also introduces an explicit light-attenuation / mixed-layer averaging process (Beer\u2013Lambert self-shading) that is not present in TRUTH.",
