  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ system with more mechanistic detail than the TRUTH Python NPZ. Core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) are present but many are implemented using alternate formulations from the literature: uptake uses Michaelis\u2013Menten modulated by a Droop quota, growth is Droop + explicit light limitation, grazing is Holling Type II with a food-dependent assimilation efficiency, and zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent). A clear mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (k*(N0-N) or -k*P in TRUTH) is missing. The candidate also adds several processes not present in TRUTH (internal quota state Q and dynamics, explicit light attenuation/self-shading, Q10 temperature scaling, food-dependent assimilation efficiency, explicit partial recycling from sinking aggregates).",
