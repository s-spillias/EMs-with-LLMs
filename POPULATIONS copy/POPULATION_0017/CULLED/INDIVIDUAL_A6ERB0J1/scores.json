  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a richer NPZ model with Droop quota dynamics, explicit light attenuation, temperature (Q10) scaling, and dynamic assimilation efficiency. Core ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ are present but often as alternate formulations: nutrient uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten-style but embedded in a Droop quota framework; grazing is Holling-type rather than the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH; phytoplankton mortality and aggregation/losses are included but with both linear and quadratic forms; zooplankton growth is via assimilation of grazing but mortality is quadratic rather than TRUTH's linear term. Importantly, the candidate omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients, phytoplankton, and zooplankton (the TRUTH model includes k*(N0 - N) in dN/dt and linear mixing losses for P). Several additional processes (internal quota state, explicit light/mixed-layer averaging, Q10 temperature scaling, dynamic assimilation efficiency and quota-limited uptake) are introduced that are not in the TRUTH NPZ.",
