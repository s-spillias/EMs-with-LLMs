ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:

The current NPZ model includes sophisticated features:
- Light limitation with phytoplankton self-shading (Beer-Lambert law)
- Temperature dependencies via Q10 formulation for all major processes
- Food-dependent zooplankton assimilation efficiency (e_min to e_max)
- Multiple nutrient recycling pathways (mortality, sinking, excretion)
- Density-dependent processes (aggregation, zooplankton mortality)

IDENTIFIED GAP:

The model assumes instantaneous coupling between external nutrient availability and phytoplankton growth. This is a simplification that misses important phytoplankton physiology:

1. Phytoplankton can take up nutrients in excess of immediate needs (luxury uptake)
2. Internal nutrient storage allows growth to continue after external depletion
3. Time lags exist between nutrient uptake and growth responses

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Droop Internal Quota Model

Adding phytoplankton internal nutrient quota (Q, units: g N / g C) as a fourth state variable.

Key changes:
- Growth rate now depends on internal quota: μ = r * (1 - Q_min/Q) * light_limitation
- Nutrient uptake (V) follows Michaelis-Menten but is decoupled from growth
- Uptake rate: V = V_max * N/(K_N + N) when Q < Q_max (storage capacity limit)
- Internal quota changes via: dQ/dt = V - μ*Q (uptake minus dilution by growth)

New parameters:
- Q_min: Minimum cell quota (subsistence quota, below which growth = 0)
- Q_max: Maximum cell quota (storage capacity)
- V_max: Maximum nutrient uptake rate (can exceed growth rate, enabling luxury uptake)

Ecological benefits:
- Phytoplankton blooms can persist after nutrient drawdown
- More realistic nutrient-phytoplankton phase relationships
- Captures luxury uptake phenomenon observed in nature
- Better representation of bloom initiation and termination dynamics
- Allows for nutrient pulses to have delayed effects on biomass

This modification maintains all existing processes (grazing, mortality, recycling, light, temperature) while adding a more mechanistic representation of phytoplankton nutrient physiology that is well-supported by laboratory and field observations.
