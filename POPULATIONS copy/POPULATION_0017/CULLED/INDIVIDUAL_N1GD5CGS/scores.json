  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the same high-level compartments (N, P, Z) and the canonical flows: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling to nutrients, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and mortality terms. However the functional forms differ in many places from the TRUTH Python model. The candidate uses multiplicative Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation \u00d7 a saturating light term for uptake, Holling type II grazing, temperature (Q10) scaling, stress-modulated sinking and food-quality effects, and quadratic (density-dependent) aggregation and zooplankton mortality. Crucially, the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N) in TRUTH) and an explicit mixing loss for P and Z, replacing linear sinks in TRUTH with different forms (e.g., quadratic aggregation). Many candidate terms therefore match literature alternates rather than being exact matches to TRUTH.",
