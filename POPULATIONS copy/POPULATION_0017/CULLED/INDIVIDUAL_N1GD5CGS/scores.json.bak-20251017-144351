  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles of the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from predators, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and mortality terms) but uses different mathematical forms in many cases and also adds multiple processes not present in the TRUTH code. Uptake and growth are implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer average) and Q10 temperature scaling, rather than the TRUTH's single compound nutrient-limited growth term. Grazing and zooplankton growth are present but use a Holling II P/(K+P) form (candidate) vs the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient equation that appears in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N)), and it adds extra processes (temperature/Q10 scaling, explicit light attenuation and mixed-layer averaging, nutrient-stress-modulated sinking and food-quality effects, quadratic aggregation and quadratic zooplankton mortality). Many of these extra processes are plausible and found in the literature but are not present in the TRUTH NPZ formulation.",
