  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same three state variables (N, P, Z) and includes uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality and aggregation processes. However, many functional forms differ from the TRUTH Python model: uptake is implemented as a Michaelis-Menten nutrient term multiplied by explicit light limitation and a density/carrying-capacity factor (TRUTH uses N/(e+N) * a/(b+cP) * P). Grazing is Holling type II here (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) vs. the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form. Zooplankton growth uses a food-dependent assimilation efficiency (e_effective) and temperature/Q10 scaling is applied to multiple rates \u2014 both absent from TRUTH. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients of the form k*(N0 - N) that appears in TRUTH. Overall the candidate uses plausible alternate ecological formulations (Michaelis-Menten uptake, Holling-II grazing, quadratic aggregation, quadratic Z mortality, food-dependent assimilation, Q10 temperature scaling, explicit Beer-Lambert light limitation), and adds extra process detail (light field, temperature scaling, variable assimilation efficiency) not present in the TRUTH NPZ.",
