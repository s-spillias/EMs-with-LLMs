  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, and mortality terms) but uses different mathematical choices and several additional processes. Uptake is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light-limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert / Monod) and modulated by temperature (Q10). Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form, and zooplankton mortality is a composite of food-dependent starvation (linear, scaled by a starvation factor) plus quadratic density-dependent mortality rather than the single linear loss in TRUTH. The candidate also omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0 - N) in TRUTH) and for phytoplankton, and it introduces explicit temperature (Q10) scaling, Beer\u2013Lambert light self-shading, egestion ((1-e)*grazing), and a separate quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Overall: matches ecological roles but often as alternates from the literature; some TRUTH terms (mixing) are missing and several new processes are present.",
