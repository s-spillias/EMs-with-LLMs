  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (uptake-driven phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, mortality/recycling) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH reference and omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH. Key differences: nutrient uptake is a Michaelis-Menten (Monod) N-limitation multiplied by an explicit light-limitation (depth-averaged Beer\u2013Lambert) and a dynamic photoacclimation state (theta). Grazing is Holling type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) hill-form. Recycling is represented by (1-e)*grazing and mortality recycling rather than TRUTH's specific lambda_/beta-style terms. The candidate also adds an explicit chlorophyll:carbon state (theta) with Geider-style dynamics and chlorophyll-dependent self-shading \u2014 processes not present in the TRUTH code. The candidate also lacks the explicit mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt and mixing losses for P and Z that the TRUTH model includes.",
