  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) but uses different functional forms and adds explicit photoacclimation and chlorophyll-based light attenuation. Uptake and growth are represented as Michaelis-Menten (Monod) nutrient limitation multiplied by a Monod-like light limitation (avg_light/(K_I+avg_light)), grazing is Holling type II, and recycling is represented as unassimilated grazing + mortality recycling. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton that exists in the TRUTH model. Several extra ecological components are present (explicit Chl:C state with Geider-style dynamics; chlorophyll-dependent light attenuation; explicit quadratic (density-dependent) mortalities).",
