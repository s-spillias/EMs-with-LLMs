  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ with explicit nutrient uptake (Michaelis\u2013Menten) co-limited by an explicit light limitation computed from Beer\u2013Lambert averaging in the mixed layer, Holling-Type II grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, and quadratic zooplankton mortality. It therefore differs from the TRUTH model in mechanistic detail: uptake/grazing functional forms are alternate (TRUTH uses a P-dependent denominator and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form), and the candidate omits the TRUTH environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton. The candidate adds an explicit light attenuation / mixed-layer averaging component (Beer\u2013Lambert based), which is not present in TRUTH.",
