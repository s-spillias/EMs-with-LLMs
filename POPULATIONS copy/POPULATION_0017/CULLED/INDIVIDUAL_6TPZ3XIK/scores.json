  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) but uses different mathematical choices than the TRUTH NPZ in several key places. Phytoplankton growth is modelled as multiplicative nutrient Michaelis-Menten \u00d7 light Michaelis-Menten with an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer average (an extra explicit light/attenuation process). Grazing is Holling type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response. Phytoplankton non-grazing mortality is linear (matching TRUTH's linear loss term), while zooplankton mortality is density-dependent (quadratic) rather than the TRUTH linear loss. The candidate omits the TRUTH nutrient mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N)) and also omits explicit mixing/entrainment terms for P and Z. Recycling from grazing and mortality is present in the candidate but parameterized differently (e.g., (1-e)*grazing and delta*Z_mortality). Overall: most ecological roles are present, many as acceptable alternates; nutrient mixing and P/Z mixing in the TRUTH are missing, and explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation + mixed-layer averaging is an extra component.",
