  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, recycling) but uses different functional forms for several processes and omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms present in the TRUTH model. The candidate adds an explicit dynamic Chl:C state (photoacclimation) and an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation formulation (with chlorophyll-specific self-shading), both not present in the TRUTH code. Many matching pieces fall into standard alternates from the literature (Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, Holling Type II grazing, linear+quadratic mortalities, recycling as fraction of mortality/excretion).",
