  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the same NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) but uses different mathematical formulations for many terms and omits an explicit mixing/entrainment term present in the TRUTH model. The candidate follows common literature alternates: Michaelis-Menten/Monod nutrient uptake co-limited by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert average light + Monod light term), Holling type II grazing, linear+quadratic phytoplankton mortality, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and recycling via excretion/inefficient assimilation and mortality fractions. The candidate adds explicit radiative transfer/self-shading and a dynamic photoacclimation state (theta \u2014 Chl:C), both absent in the TRUTH implementation.",
