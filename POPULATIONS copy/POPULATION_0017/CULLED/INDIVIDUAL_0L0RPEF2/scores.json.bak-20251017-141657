  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ with nutrient-limited, light-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling-II grazing, assimilation-based zooplankton growth, and multiple mortality/recycling pathways. Many canonical roles in TRUTH are present but represented with different mathematical choices: the candidate uses Michaelis\u2013Menten style nutrient uptake combined multiplicatively with an explicit light-limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert averaged over a mixed layer) and a Holling Type II grazing term, whereas TRUTH uses a nutrient term N/(e+N) multiplied by aP/(b + cP) and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing (Type III-like). The candidate adds several ecological processes not in TRUTH (temperature Q10 scaling, explicit light attenuation/self-shading, variable assimilation efficiency tied to nutrient quality, food-dependent starvation mortality, quadratic aggregation and quadratic zooplankton mortality, explicit recycling from sinking aggregates). Mixing/entrainment of nutrients and a P mixing loss present in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and -(s+k)*P) is not implemented in the candidate.",
