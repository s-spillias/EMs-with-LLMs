ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:

The current NPZ model includes comprehensive physical and biological processes:
- Light limitation with self-shading (Beer-Lambert law)
- Temperature effects via Q10 formulation
- Multiple nutrient recycling pathways
- Density-dependent and food-dependent mortality
- Phytoplankton aggregation and sinking

IDENTIFIED LIMITATION:

The model assumes constant zooplankton assimilation efficiency (e = 0.3), which oversimplifies 
the ecological reality that phytoplankton nutritional quality varies with environmental conditions.

ECOLOGICAL REASONING FOR IMPROVEMENT:

In natural systems, phytoplankton growing under nutrient limitation accumulate carbon-rich storage 
compounds (lipids, carbohydrates) but remain nutrient-poor, resulting in high C:N ratios. This 
affects the food web in two ways:

1. Low-quality (nutrient-poor) phytoplankton are less efficiently assimilated by zooplankton
2. Zooplankton may exhibit reduced grazing rates on poor-quality food

This creates an important feedback mechanism: when nutrients become scarce, phytoplankton quality 
decreases, which reduces grazing pressure, allowing phytoplankton to persist at lower nutrient 
concentrations than would be predicted with constant food quality.

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:

Implement variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency as a function of phytoplankton nutritional 
status (nutrient quota). The phytoplankton quota is represented by the nutrient limitation term 
(N/(K_N + N)), which ranges from 0 (severe limitation) to 1 (nutrient replete).

Mathematical formulation:
- e_variable = e_min + (e_max - e_min) * (N/(K_N + N))

Where:
- e_min = minimum assimilation efficiency under severe nutrient limitation (low phytoplankton quality)
- e_max = maximum assimilation efficiency under nutrient-replete conditions (high phytoplankton quality)
- N/(K_N + N) = phytoplankton nutrient quota proxy (0 to 1)

This approach:
- Captures the key ecological process without requiring a full quota model
- Uses existing state variables (no new differential equations)
- Maintains model parsimony while adding ecological realism
- Creates a stabilizing feedback that can explain phytoplankton persistence under low nutrients

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:

1. Under high nutrients: High phytoplankton quality → high assimilation efficiency → strong top-down control
2. Under low nutrients: Low phytoplankton quality → low assimilation efficiency → reduced top-down control
3. More realistic nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics with quality-mediated interactions
4. Potential for more stable coexistence at intermediate nutrient levels

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

- Replace constant parameter 'e' with two parameters: 'e_min' and 'e_max'
- Calculate variable efficiency in each time step based on current nutrient limitation
- Maintain all other model components unchanged
- Add appropriate bounds: e_min (0.1-0.3), e_max (0.3-0.7)
