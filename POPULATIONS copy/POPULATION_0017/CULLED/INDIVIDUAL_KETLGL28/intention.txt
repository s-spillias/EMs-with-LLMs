ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:

The current NPZ model implements standard plankton dynamics with nutrient limitation, grazing, and dual nutrient recycling pathways (fast excretion and slow remineralization). However, it is missing a critical process for oceanic mixed layer dynamics: LIGHT LIMITATION.

KEY ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. Phytoplankton growth is only nutrient-limited, ignoring light availability
2. No representation of self-shading effects that regulate bloom dynamics
3. For oceanic mixed layer context, light is as important as nutrients in controlling primary production

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:

Added LIGHT LIMITATION WITH SELF-SHADING to phytoplankton growth:

1. Light attenuation follows Beer-Lambert law:
   - Background attenuation (water + dissolved matter)
   - Self-shading by phytoplankton biomass
   - Average light in mixed layer calculated analytically

2. Light limitation function:
   - Photosynthesis-irradiance relationship (hyperbolic tangent or Monod-type)
   - Multiplicative interaction with nutrient limitation (Liebig's law of minimum)

3. New parameters added:
   - I_0: Surface light intensity (W m^-2 or Î¼mol photons m^-2 s^-1)
   - k_w: Background light attenuation coefficient (m^-1)
   - k_c: Specific attenuation by phytoplankton (m^2 g C^-1)
   - K_I: Half-saturation constant for light limitation (W m^-2)
   - H: Mixed layer depth (m)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:

1. Light is a fundamental resource for photosynthesis in aquatic systems
2. Self-shading creates negative feedback preventing unlimited phytoplankton growth
3. Explains seasonal bloom patterns and depth-dependent productivity
4. Well-established in marine ecology literature (e.g., Riley 1946, Steele 1962, Evans & Parslow 1985)
5. Critical for realistic mixed layer dynamics where light varies with depth and season

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

- Average light in mixed layer: I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-k_total * H)) / (k_total * H)
  where k_total = k_w + k_c * P
- Light limitation: f_I = I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)
- Modified growth: uptake = r * f_N * f_I * P (both nutrients AND light limit growth)

This represents a well-justified ecological enhancement that captures fundamental mixed layer physics without excessive complexity.
