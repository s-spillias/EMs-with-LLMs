  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same basic NPZ roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, recycling/excretion, and zooplankton growth) but uses alternative mathematical forms for many terms and omits the explicit environmental mixing/dilution term present in the TRUTH model. Uptake in the candidate is multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten in N and a separate light limitation f_I computed from an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer integral (an extra component relative to TRUTH). Grazing is Holling type II (alternates) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. Phytoplankton mortality is linear in the candidate (alternate) and zooplankton mortality is quadratic (alternate). The candidate explicitly separates fast excretion (delta * grazing) and slow recycling (gamma * mortality), whereas TRUTH uses different parameterizations of recycling; the candidate lacks the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N). Overall most components match literature alternates rather than being exact algebraic matches to TRUTH.",
