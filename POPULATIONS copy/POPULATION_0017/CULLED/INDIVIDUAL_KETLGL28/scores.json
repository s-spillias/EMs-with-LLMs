  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, recycling, zooplankton growth and mortality) but using alternative functional forms and some missing terms relative to the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten (N) \u00d7 light limitation (I) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) form. Grazing is a Holling-II (P/(K_P+P) * Z) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) formulation. Zooplankton mortality is quadratic in the candidate (m_Z Z^2) while TRUTH uses linear (q Z). Importantly, the candidate omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for N, P and Z (TRUTH had k*(N0 - N) and linear P mixing/loss terms). The candidate introduces an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation + mixed-layer averaged irradiance (I_0, k_w, k_c, H, K_I) that is not present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and maps to known alternate formulations in the literature but is not a term-by-term match to the TRUTH model.",
