  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth and grazing losses, zooplankton growth and mortality, nutrient recycling) but uses different mathematical choices and adds ecological processes not present in the TRUTH reference. Uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten-like but multiplied by an explicit light limitation and temperature Q10 scaling (TRUTH had no light or temperature). Grazing is Holling Type II (TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form). Zooplankton growth appears via assimilation of grazing with a food-dependent assimilation efficiency (variable e_effective) rather than a fixed alpha. The candidate lacks an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N) in TRUTH) and for phytoplankton (no -k*P term), and it adds aggregation (quadratic P^2 loss) plus explicit recycling fraction from aggregates. Overall many canonical roles are present but several are implemented as alternates (Holling II, Michaelis\u2013Menten with light/temperature) and a few TRUTH terms (mixing) are missing.",
