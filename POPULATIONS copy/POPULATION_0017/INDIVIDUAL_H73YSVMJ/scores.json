  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the three-state NPZ roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing-driven transfer to zooplankton, and mortality/recycling) but uses different mechanistic forms from the TRUTH Python model. Key differences: uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) nutrient term multiplied by an explicit saturating light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer average), grazing is Holling Type II rather than the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form in TRUTH, and zooplankton mortality is quadratic rather than linear. The candidate also omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients present in TRUTH. Several extra process-level modifiers (temperature Q10 scaling, explicit light attenuation/mixed-layer averaging, and explicit recycling from aggregation/sinking) appear in the candidate but are absent from the TRUTH code.",
