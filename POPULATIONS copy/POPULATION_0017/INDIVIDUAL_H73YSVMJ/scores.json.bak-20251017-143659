Uptake in the candidate is multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten (nutrient) \u00d7 Monod (light) with explicit Beer\u2013Lambert self-shading and a light half-saturation, whereas TRUTH uses N/(e+N) \u00d7 (a/(b + c*P)) * P (a different P-dependent factor). Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) while TRUTH uses a Hill/Holling-type III form (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). The candidate includes explicit temperature scaling (Q10) on many rates, explicit light attenuation/average-light calculation, and quadratic aggregation and quadratic zooplankton mortality \u2014 processes or modifiers not present in TRUTH. Several canonical roles are present but often as alternates from the literature rather than exact matches to TRUTH.",
