MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with light limitation and nutrient recycling. It includes:
- Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake with light co-limitation
- Holling Type II grazing functional response
- Light attenuation with phytoplankton self-shading (Beer-Lambert law)
- Nutrient recycling from mortality

IDENTIFIED ASYMMETRY:
The model currently uses density-dependent (quadratic) mortality for zooplankton but linear mortality for phytoplankton. This creates an ecological inconsistency, as phytoplankton populations in nature also exhibit strong density-dependent mortality processes.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Phytoplankton mortality in oceanic systems is not constant but increases with cell density due to:

1. VIRAL LYSIS: Virus-host contact rates increase quadratically with host density, leading to epidemic dynamics during blooms. This is a major loss term for phytoplankton, often exceeding grazing losses.

2. ALLELOPATHY: Many phytoplankton species produce allelopathic compounds that accumulate at high densities, causing self-toxicity and increased mortality.

3. AGGREGATION AND SINKING: At high cell densities, phytoplankton cells aggregate more readily, leading to enhanced sinking losses from the mixed layer.

4. NUTRIENT MICRO-DEPLETION: Even with adequate bulk nutrients, high local cell densities can create microscale nutrient depletion zones, increasing stress-related mortality.

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
Implement mixed linear-quadratic phytoplankton mortality:

P_mortality = m_P * P + m_P2 * P^2

Where:
- m_P (linear term): Baseline mortality from senescence, background viral activity, and constant sinking
- m_P2 (quadratic term): Density-dependent mortality from epidemic viral lysis, allelopathy, and aggregation

This formulation:
- Maintains low mortality at low phytoplankton densities (allowing population recovery)
- Increases mortality disproportionately during blooms (capturing bloom crash dynamics)
- Provides symmetry with zooplankton mortality structure
- Better represents the non-linear nature of phytoplankton loss processes
- May improve model fit during bloom peak and decline phases

PARAMETER CONSIDERATIONS:
- m_P: Retain current value (0.1 day^-1) as baseline linear mortality
- m_P2: New parameter for density-dependent mortality (estimated range: 0.01-0.5 day^-1 (g C m^-3)^-1)
  * Lower bound: 0.01 to allow weak density dependence
  * Upper bound: 0.5 to prevent unrealistic mortality at moderate densities
  * Initial value: 0.1 as a moderate starting point

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- More realistic bloom dynamics with sharper peaks and faster crashes
- Improved representation of phytoplankton-virus interactions
- Better model fit during high phytoplankton concentration periods
- Enhanced ecological realism through symmetric treatment of trophic level mortality
