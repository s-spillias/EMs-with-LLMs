  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake/growth in the candidate is a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert average-light -> Monod f(I)), whereas TRUTH uses a nutrient Monod times a P-dependent factor (a/(b + c*P)) and no explicit light attenuation. Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) while TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (sigmoidal/Type III-like) functional. The candidate includes density-dependent quadratic mortality for both P and Z and explicit light attenuation/self-shading over a mixed layer \u2014 processes/formulations not present in TRUTH. The candidate also omits the explicit environmental mixing/dilution term (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P) that appears in the TRUTH model. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles (uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, assimilation) but uses alternate, commonly used mathematical forms (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake with multiplicative light limitation; Holling II grazing; quadratic mortality), and it adds explicit light attenuation and quadratic mortalities which are extra relative to TRUTH.",
