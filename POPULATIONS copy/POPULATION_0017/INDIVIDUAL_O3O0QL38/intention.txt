MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The NPZ model includes comprehensive representations of:
- Nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth with light co-limitation
- Temperature effects on all biological rates via Q10 formulation
- Zooplankton grazing with Type II functional response
- Nutrient recycling pathways from mortality and inefficient feeding
- Phytoplankton aggregation/sinking with partial nutrient recovery
- Self-shading effects on light availability

PARAMETER ANALYSIS:
The zooplankton mortality coefficient (m_Z = 2.426, bounds: 2.276-2.576) has been updated from literature with tight constraints, indicating a well-established quadratic mortality term representing predation or density-dependent effects.

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The model currently lacks a density-independent starvation mortality term for zooplankton. The existing quadratic mortality (m_Z * Z^2) only represents density-dependent processes (predation, crowding), but zooplankton also experience baseline physiological mortality that increases under food limitation.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
In natural plankton systems, zooplankton cannot persist indefinitely at very low phytoplankton concentrations. They experience:
1. Metabolic costs that must be met regardless of food availability
2. Increased mortality from starvation stress
3. Reduced reproductive success and survival under food limitation

This food-dependent mortality is critical for:
- Preventing unrealistic zooplankton persistence during phytoplankton crashes
- Creating more realistic predator-prey oscillations
- Representing the energetic constraints on zooplankton populations
- Improving model realism during bloom initiation and termination phases

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
Add a food-dependent baseline mortality term for zooplankton:

m_Z_baseline * (K_starvation / (K_starvation + P)) * Z

Where:
- m_Z_baseline: baseline zooplankton mortality rate at zero food (day^-1)
- K_starvation: half-saturation constant for starvation mortality (g C m^-3)
- This term is HIGH when P is low (starvation conditions)
- This term is LOW when P is high (food available)

The total zooplankton mortality becomes:
Z_mortality = m_Z_baseline * (K_starvation / (K_starvation + P)) * Z + m_Z * Z^2

This combines:
1. Food-dependent baseline mortality (density-independent, food-limited)
2. Density-dependent mortality (predation, crowding)

MATHEMATICAL FORM:
The reverse Michaelis-Menten formulation ensures:
- Smooth transition between high and low mortality states
- Asymptotic behavior (approaches m_Z_baseline as P → 0)
- Minimal impact when food is abundant (approaches 0 as P → ∞)
- Biologically interpretable parameters

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
1. More realistic zooplankton crashes when phytoplankton are depleted
2. Improved representation of bloom dynamics
3. Better capture of the energetic constraints on zooplankton
4. More realistic minimum viable phytoplankton concentrations for zooplankton persistence
5. Enhanced predator-prey oscillations with appropriate lag times

This modification maintains the existing well-constrained quadratic mortality while adding a complementary process that represents a different ecological mechanism (starvation vs. predation/crowding).
