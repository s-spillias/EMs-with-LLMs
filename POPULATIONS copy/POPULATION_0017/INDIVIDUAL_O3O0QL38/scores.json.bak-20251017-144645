  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (uptake \u2192 P growth; grazing \u2192 Z growth; recycling to N; mortality terms) but uses different functional forms and several additional processes. Phytoplankton growth is implemented as a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit saturating light limitation (averaged Beer\u2013Lambert), rather than the TRUTH model's N/(e+N) \u00d7 (a/(b + c P)) \u00d7 P. Grazing is Holling-type II in the candidate (P/(K_P+P) \u00d7 Z) while TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Hill/type-III) form. The candidate adds temperature/Q10 scaling, explicit mixed-layer light attenuation with self-shading, food-dependent (starvation) zooplankton mortality, quadratic aggregation for P, and quadratic density-dependent zooplankton mortality; it also omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients that TRUTH has (k*(N0-N)).",
