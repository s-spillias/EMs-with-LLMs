  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical trophic interactions (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 zooplankton grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) and nutrient recycling, but with different functional choices and extra processes compared with the TRUTH Python NPZ. Uptake and growth are multiplicative nutrient \u00d7 light terms (candidate: Monod on N \u00d7 explicit Beer\u2013Lambert averaged light), grazing is implemented as Holling type II (candidate) rather than the TRUTH's P^2-saturating form, and zooplankton dynamics include both food-dependent (starvation) mortality and quadratic density-dependent mortality rather than the TRUTH's simple linear loss. Important omissions relative to TRUTH: the candidate does not include an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt, dP/dt or dZ/dt analogous to TRUTH's k*(N0 - N) or (s + k)*P. The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) scaling and a mechanistic mixed-layer light averaging, which are not present in TRUTH.",
