  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality and mixing flows. Many functional roles in the TRUTH model are present but some are implemented with different mathematical choices: uptake is multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit light saturation (f_I) and a mu_max term, whereas TRUTH used N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) * P. Grazing is a Holling-type saturating function and matches the TRUTH Holling-III form (generalised by exponent h). Recycling (unassimilated grazing, mortality remineralization, excretion) and a mixing supply to nutrients are present and correspond closely to TRUTH. Differences / extras include explicit temperature (Q10) modifiers on production and loss rates, an explicit irradiance/ light limitation term, and an added quadratic self-limitation term for zooplankton (Z^2) that is not in TRUTH.",
