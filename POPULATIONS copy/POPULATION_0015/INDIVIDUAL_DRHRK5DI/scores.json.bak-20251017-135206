  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements all major NPZ flows (nutrient uptake by P, grazing, recycling to N, and mixing supply) but using different mechanistic choices and extra process terms. Uptake/growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by explicit light (f_I) and temperature (f_T) modifiers (i.e., multiplicative limitation) rather than the exact N*(a/(b + c P)) form in TRUTH. Grazing is a Holling-type saturating functional response (P^h/(K_G^h+P^h)), comparable to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) family when h=2 but with explicit assimilation efficiency and temperature scaling. Recycling to N is explicit (unassimilated fraction, mortality remineralization, excretion). Physical mixing for N is the same linear entrainment term as TRUTH. The candidate adds explicit temperature (Q10) modifiers, an explicit light term, and a quadratic zooplankton self-limitation not present in TRUTH. Phytoplankton physical mixing/loss as a distinct mixing term (separate from mortality) present in TRUTH is not represented as a separate P loss in the candidate (mixing only applied to N). Overall the candidate is mechanistically plausible and maps closely to canonical alternate formulations but is not identical to the TRUTH implementation.",
