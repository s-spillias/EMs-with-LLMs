  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling-style grazing, recycling of unassimilated ingestion and mortality back to nutrients, and physical mixing of nutrients. Many ecological roles from the TRUTH model are present but parameterized differently: nutrient uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten style multiplied by separate temperature (Q10) and light limitation factors (not in TRUTH); grazing uses a generalized Holling form (TRUTH used P^2/(mu^2+P^2), here P^h/(K_G^h+P^h)); phytoplankton mortality is linear as in TRUTH but mixing is only applied to nutrients (TRUTH applied a mixing-like term to P as a loss). The candidate also adds explicit temperature and light modifiers, an explicit excretion flux, and a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton self-limitation that are not present in the TRUTH NPZ.",
