  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake, grazing-mediated recycling, and mixing. Many ecological roles from the TRUTH model are present but implemented with different functional forms or added complexity: uptake is multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation times an explicit light-saturation (with self-shading) and a mu_max prefactor (an alternate formulation vs TRUTH); grazing is a Holling-type functional response (Holling III generalised with exponent h) with explicit assimilation efficiency, matching the TRUTH role but as an alternate parameterisation; mixing is structurally identical to TRUTH. The candidate also introduces explicit temperature (Q10) modifiers on rates, separate remineralization/excretion pathways, and an extra quadratic density-dependent zooplankton loss, which are not in the TRUTH code. Overall the model is ecologically complete relative to the canonical components but uses several alternate formulations and adds realistic extra processes (temperature dependence, quadratic Z self-limitation, explicit excretion/remineralization bookkeeping).",
