Assessment of current model and chosen improvement

1) Fit to data
- The residuals file was not provided, so a quantitative assessment of fit quality (bias, autocorrelation, amplitude/timing mismatches) cannot be performed here.
- Based on typical NPZ behavior without optical feedback, common residual issues include:
  - Over-predicted bloom amplitude
  - Bloom initiation too early under high constant light
  - Insufficient bloom decay after peak

2) Alignment with project context
- The model captures core mixed-layer NPZ processes:
  - Phytoplankton growth limited by nutrient and light (saturating forms)
  - Zooplankton grazing (Holling type III)
  - Temperature scaling via Q10 for growth and losses
  - Linear and quadratic loss terms for P and Z (Z has quadratic; P has linear)
  - Mixing-driven nutrient supply to a deep value N_star
- These processes match the stated context (N, P, Z in the mixed layer). However, optical feedback of biomass on light is missing.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Optical feedback/self-shading: In the ocean mixed layer, phytoplankton biomass attenuates available light (Beer–Lambert law). Without this, light limitation remains too permissive at high P, often causing overly large or premature blooms.
- Detritus and remineralization lags: All mortality is instantly remineralized to N; no detrital pool delays that can improve phase lags. This is a reasonable omission for parsimony but can bias timing.
- Variable assimilation efficiency: e_Z is fixed, whereas in reality it varies with food quality/availability. This could be addressed later if needed.
- Environmental variability: I and T are constant; seasonal or event-scale variability could improve realism if data support it.

4) Parameter review
- log_q10 has updated literature-informed value and bounds (value ~0.659, q10≈1.93). This remains compatible with the present Q10 structure; no structural change required.
- Other parameters are within plausible ecological ranges. The light half-saturation K_I is moderate (~75 W m^-2), which is reasonable given the current formulation but becomes more realistic when combined with optical feedback.

5) Chosen improvement: biomass-dependent light limitation (self-shading)
- Approach: Environmental modifier and indirect feedback mechanism.
- Change: Replace constant-light limitation with light attenuated by phytoplankton biomass:
    I_eff = I * exp(-k_shade * P)
    f_I = I_eff / (K_I + I_eff)
  The attenuation coefficient k_shade (>0) is new. This introduces a negative feedback where high P reduces light, damping peaks and delaying bloom onset—common residual issues.
- Justification:
  - Ecologically realistic: Mixed-layer average light availability declines as biomass increases.
  - Minimal added complexity: Only one new parameter; no new state variables.
  - No data leakage: Uses previous-step predicted P only.
- Parameterization:
  - New parameter: log_k_shade (log-transformed for positivity).
  - Suggested prior/penalty bounds on natural scale for k_shade: [1e-3, 5] per (g C m^-3).
    - Lower end avoids effectively zero attenuation; upper end allows strong shading when P is high but typical P (0.01–0.5 g C m^-3) yields realistic reductions: exp(-k_shade*P) ~ exp(-0.005 to -2.5).

6) Notes for future iterations (if residuals show remaining issues)
- If peaks remain too high, consider quadratic phytoplankton mortality (self-crowding) or variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency e_Z(P).
- If timing lags are off, consider a simple detritus pool to delay remineralization.
- If seasonal patterns are present in data, consider time-varying I and T or mixed-layer depth effects.

Summary
- Implemented self-shading in light limitation via a new parameter k_shade to improve ecological realism and likely resolve common residual patterns in bloom dynamics.
