  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the main ecological roles of a NPZ model: nutrient-limited phytoplankton uptake, light/self-shading limitation, grazing-driven transfers with an assimilation efficiency, and both linear and quadratic zooplankton mortality. Uptake and growth are Monod-like with a self-shading light proxy; grazing is a Hill/Holling-type functional response with an additional smooth threshold. However the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton that exists in the TRUTH model. The candidate also adds time-varying seasonality on growth and grazing, an explicit exudation/unassimilated fraction of uptake, and a quadratic Z mortality term that are not present in TRUTH.",
