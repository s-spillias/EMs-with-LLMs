  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing-mediated zooplankton growth, and mortalities) using common alternate functional forms relative to the TRUTH model. Uptake is a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term multiplied by a self-shading light proxy and seasonal modulation (mu_max * fN * fL * P), grazing is a Hill/Holling-type response with an added smooth threshold and seasonal modulation, and zooplankton growth uses an explicit assimilation efficiency. Important TRUTH processes that are missing in the candidate are explicit mixing/entrainment terms for N/P/Z (the TRUTH k*(N0 - N) term is not present, and P and Z have no mixing term). The candidate also introduces extra processes not present in TRUTH: seasonal modulation of rates, an explicit fraction of phytoplankton uptake returned to nutrients (exudation/non-conversion), and a quadratic zooplankton mortality (density-dependent closure).",
