  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (N uptake by P, grazing P->Z, recycling, mixing) but parameterizes those processes differently from the TRUTH script. Uptake/growth are implemented as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by a seasonal light proxy (f_L) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) combined term. Grazing is a flexible Holling-type P^q/(K_G^q+P^q) formulation that can reproduce the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) when q=2. Recycling is aggregated as a single fraction phi_rec of all non-growth losses (exudation + mortality + unassimilated ingestion) rather than the TRUTH's separate explicit recycling coefficients/terms. Physical mixing is present and matches TRUTH for nutrients, but the candidate omits an explicit mixing loss term on P (TRUTH had k*P as part of P loss). The candidate also adds explicit seasonal forcing (f_L), a flexible switching exponent (nu -> q), and an explicit recycling fraction (phi_rec) that are not present in the TRUTH code. Numerical/estimation machinery (bound penalties, positivity smoothing, observation likelihood) are present but are not ecological processes.",
