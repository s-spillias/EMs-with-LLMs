  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with the same high-level compartments (N, P, Z) and Holling\u2011III grazing as in the TRUTH model, but several functional forms differ. Nutrient uptake/growth in the candidate is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit seasonal light modifier and a separate yield parameter, whereas the TRUTH model uses a different P-dependent modulation (a/(b + c P)) together with N/(e+N). Grazing-driven zooplankton growth is present and equivalent in form (Holling\u2011III \u00d7 efficiency \u00d7 Z). The candidate adds a density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality, and it parameterizes recycling and excretion differently (explicit assimilation efficiency, excretion fraction, and mortality remineralization fractions). Mixing appears for nutrients in both (same functional form) but the candidate does not include an explicit phytoplankton mixing loss term. Overall, most canonical processes are present but some are alternate formulations and there are a few extra ecological mechanisms (seasonal light forcing, explicit biomass yield, quadratic Z mortality).",
