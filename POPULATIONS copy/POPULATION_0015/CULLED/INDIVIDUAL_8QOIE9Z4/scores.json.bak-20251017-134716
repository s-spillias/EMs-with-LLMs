  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) with mass-balanced recycling and linear mortalities, but parameterizes several processes differently from the TRUTH model. Uptake is a classic Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) form with an explicit self-shading light term and an explicit retention efficiency (epsilon_P). Grazing is a generalized Holling form with a tunable exponent and an additional smooth threshold and seasonal modulation\u2014both not present in TRUTH. Mixing/entrainment of nutrients and physical loss of phytoplankton present in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P) are absent in the candidate. Several numerical/implementation features (forward Euler time stepping, smooth non-negativity enforcement, seasonal modifiers) are included but are implementation choices rather than new ecological state variables.",
