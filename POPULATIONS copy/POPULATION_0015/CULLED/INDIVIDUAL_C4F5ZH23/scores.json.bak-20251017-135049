  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Michaelis\u2013Menten style) multiplied by an explicit seasonal light modifier, Holling type\u2011III grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton growth proportional to assimilated grazing, and nutrient recycling plus mixing back to the nutrient pool. It departs from the TRUTH model in a few important ways: phytoplankton growth uses a g_max * f_nut * f_light formulation (TRUTH used a different P-dependent factor a/(b + c P) in the growth term), phytoplankton mixing/loss present in TRUTH (-(s+k)P) is not implemented for P in the candidate, and the candidate adds explicit yield (y_P) in the uptake term, explicit seasonal light forcing, and an extra quadratic zooplankton mortality term (\u03b3_Z Z^2). Nutrient mixing (exchange with deep water), Holling\u2011III grazing, linear mortality terms, and recycling from grazing/mortality are present (though parameterized somewhat differently).",
