  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient-limited phytoplankton uptake, light/self-shading limitation, grazing-mediated transfer with an assimilation fraction, and linear mortalities) but using different mathematical choices and extras. Uptake is implemented as a Monod-type N limitation multiplied by a self-shading light factor and a mu_max so it is an alternate (but ecologically equivalent) formulation to TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) * P. Grazing is a generalized Holling saturation with an added smooth threshold and seasonal modulation in the candidate, whereas TRUTH uses a fixed P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Holling form and explicit grazing-related recycling terms. The candidate omits the explicit nutrient mixing/dilution term (k*(N0-N)) present in TRUTH and does not include an explicit P mixing/sinking term matching TRUTH's (s+k)*P; it does include explicit seasonality modifiers (growth and grazing) and a smooth grazing threshold which are ecological components not present in TRUTH. Numerical integration and observation/likelihood machinery are additional modelling layers in the candidate but are not ecological processes.",
