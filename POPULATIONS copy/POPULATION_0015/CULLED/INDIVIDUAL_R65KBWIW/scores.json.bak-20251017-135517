  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven transfers, recycling, and linear mortalities. However it differs from the TRUTH formulation in functional choices: uptake is implemented as a Monod (N/(K+N)) times a self-shading factor 1/(1+alpha_sh*P) (instead of TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) and N/(e+N) form), grazing is a generalized Holling (P^h/(K_P^h+P^h)) multiplied by a smooth threshold and seasonality (instead of TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) with constant coefficients), and the candidate explicitly includes phytoplankton assimilation/respiration (epsilon_P) and time-varying seasonality for growth and grazing. The candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0 - N)) present in TRUTH and does not apply an explicit mixing loss to phytoplankton. Overall most canonical roles are present but realized with alternate functional forms and with added seasonal and retention processes.",
