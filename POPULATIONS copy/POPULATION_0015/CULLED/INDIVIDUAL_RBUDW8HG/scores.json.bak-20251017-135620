  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZD-like model that contains the core ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ (nutrient uptake by P, recycling to N, mixing, P growth and grazing losses, Z growth and mortality). Mechanistically it uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit seasonal light proxy for phytoplankton growth, a generalized Holling-type grazing with a tunable switching exponent, and an explicit detritus pool with partitioning of non-growth losses into immediate recycling and detritus (with remineralization and export). Thus many functions are ecologically equivalent to TRUTH but implemented with alternate (and more general) functional forms and additional processes (seasonality, detritus, explicit recycling fraction).",
