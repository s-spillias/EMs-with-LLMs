  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ ecology but uses different parameterizations and extra pathways compared to the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by explicit light and temperature modifiers (not present in TRUTH). Grazing is a Holling-type (P^h/(K_G^h+P^h)) formulation (TRUTH used a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing \u2014 same family but different parameterization and with a free exponent h). Recycling appears through explicit excretion, direct mortality-to-N fractions and an added detritus pool with remineralization and sinking. Mixing of nutrients is implemented identically to TRUTH. Non-grazing phytoplankton mortality is linear (matching TRUTH), but the candidate lacks an explicit phytoplankton mixing loss term. Zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic density dependence (TRUTH had only linear). Overall: most canonical processes are present but several are alternate formulations; several extra components (detritus, Q10 temperature modifier, explicit light limitation, quadratic Z self-limitation) are added.",
