MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model includes comprehensive COTS-coral dynamics with:
- COTS population growth with Allee effects and density dependence
- Type II functional responses for selective coral predation
- Temperature modulation of recruitment
- Larval immigration forcing
- Competition between fast and slow-growing coral types

However, the model CANNOT generate the episodic outbreak dynamics described in the PROJECT CONTEXT because:
1. Nutrient outbreak mechanism is completely inactive (nutrient_effect = 1.0 always)
2. No threshold-based switching between outbreak and non-outbreak states
3. Carrying capacity scales linearly with coral - no explosive growth potential
4. Missing positive feedback mechanisms that drive rapid population explosions

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: CORAL-MEDIATED OUTBREAK THRESHOLD ===

RATIONALE:
Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks are characterized by rapid population explosions when conditions are favorable, followed by crashes when resources are depleted. The key insight is that HIGH CORAL COVER itself provides the resource base that enables outbreaks through enhanced larval survival and settlement success.

MECHANISM:
Replace the inactive nutrient-based outbreak mechanism with a coral availability threshold:

1. THRESHOLD CONCEPT: When total coral cover exceeds a critical threshold, larval survival is dramatically enhanced through:
   - Abundant food resources for newly settled juveniles
   - Reduced competition for settlement space
   - Better microhabitat quality in healthy reef systems

2. SIGMOID RESPONSE: Use existing parameters (nutrient_outbreak_threshold, nutrient_response_steepness, nutrient_outbreak_multiplier) but apply them to TOTAL CORAL COVER instead of nutrients:
   
   coral_outbreak_effect = 1 + (outbreak_multiplier - 1) × sigmoid(total_coral, threshold, steepness)
   
   Where sigmoid creates sharp transition from baseline (1.0) to enhanced (outbreak_multiplier) survival

3. POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP:
   High coral → Enhanced larval survival → More COTS → Increased predation → Coral depletion → Reduced larval survival → Population crash → Coral recovery → Cycle repeats

4. PARAMETER REINTERPRETATION:
   - log_nutrient_outbreak_threshold → log_coral_outbreak_threshold (% coral cover)
   - nutrient_outbreak_multiplier → coral_outbreak_multiplier (fold-increase in larval survival)
   - nutrient_response_steepness → remains as steepness of sigmoid transition
   - log_larval_survival_efficiency → baseline survival rate (when coral < threshold)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Empirical evidence shows COTS outbreaks occur on reefs with high coral cover
- Larval settlement and juvenile survival depend critically on food availability
- Creates realistic boom-bust dynamics: outbreaks are self-limiting through coral depletion
- Threshold behavior matches observed rapid onset of outbreak events
- No new parameters needed - repurposes existing inactive nutrient parameters

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
The sigmoid function provides smooth but steep transition:
sigmoid(x, threshold, steepness) = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness × (x - threshold)))

Applied to total coral cover, this creates:
- Minimal enhancement when coral < threshold
- Rapid increase in larval survival as coral approaches threshold  
- Maximum enhancement (outbreak_multiplier) when coral >> threshold

This generates the characteristic episodic outbreak pattern central to the PROJECT CONTEXT.

=== PARAMETER UPDATES ===

Renamed parameters to reflect coral-based mechanism:
- log_nutrient_outbreak_threshold → log_coral_outbreak_threshold
  * Now represents log(% coral cover) that triggers outbreak enhancement
  * Initial value 0.693 = ~2% → exp(0.693) ≈ 2% seems too low
  * Updated to 3.0 = ~20% coral cover (ecologically realistic outbreak threshold)
  * Range: 2.3-3.9 (10-50% coral cover)

- nutrient_outbreak_multiplier → coral_outbreak_multiplier  
  * Unchanged: 2.0 (2x enhancement during high coral conditions)
  * Range: 1.0-5.0 (no enhancement to 5x enhancement)

- nutrient_response_steepness → outbreak_response_steepness
  * Unchanged: 5.0 (sharp transition at threshold)
  * Range: 1.0-10.0 (gradual to very sharp)

- log_nutrient_half_sat → REMOVED (not needed for coral-based mechanism)

All other parameters remain unchanged.
