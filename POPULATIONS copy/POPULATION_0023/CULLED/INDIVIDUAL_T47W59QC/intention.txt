Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) Outbreak Model with Coral Community Dynamics

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) on the Great Barrier Reef and their impacts on coral communities. The model captures:

1. COTS POPULATION DYNAMICS:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (critical for outbreak initiation)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival and recruitment success
   - External larval immigration from upstream reefs (key outbreak trigger)
   - Natural mortality increasing with density (disease, food limitation)
   - Boom-bust cycles driven by coral availability and density-dependent feedbacks

2. CORAL COMMUNITY DYNAMICS:
   - Two functional coral groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites)
   - Logistic growth with different intrinsic rates reflecting life history strategies
   - Selective COTS predation with Type II functional responses
   - Differential vulnerability: fast-growing corals preferred but depleted first
   - Competition for space between coral groups
   - Temperature stress effects on coral growth and mortality

3. OUTBREAK MECHANISMS:
   - Larval immigration pulses trigger initial population increase
   - Allee effect allows populations to escape low-density regulation
   - Abundant coral resources sustain exponential growth phase
   - Selective depletion of preferred fast-growing corals
   - Population crash when coral resources become limiting
   - Recovery phase as corals regrow and COTS decline to endemic levels

4. ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS:
   - Sea surface temperature affects both COTS recruitment and coral stress
   - Larval immigration represents connectivity from outbreak source reefs
   - Temperature anomalies can trigger coral bleaching and reduced growth

The model predicts characteristic COTS outbreak patterns: rapid population explosions from low endemic levels, sustained high densities during coral consumption, followed by population crashes as food becomes limiting. Coral communities show corresponding declines during outbreaks with differential impacts on fast vs. slow-growing species, followed by gradual recovery during inter-outbreak periods.
