MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model includes comprehensive COTS-coral dynamics with Allee effects, temperature responses, and predation. A critical outbreak trigger mechanism was identified: nutrient-driven larval survival enhancement.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Nutrient effect parameters are defined but nutrient data (nutrient_dat) is not available in the current dataset
2. The PROJECT CONTEXT emphasizes "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events" and "episodic outbreaks"
3. Literature strongly supports nutrient pulses (river discharge, upwelling) as primary outbreak triggers
4. The model has all necessary parameters (log_nutrient_effect, log_nutrient_threshold, log_nutrient_steepness) ready for when data becomes available

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef are strongly linked to nutrient enrichment events:
- River discharge during wet seasons delivers nutrients to coastal reefs
- Increased nutrients → phytoplankton blooms → enhanced COTS larval food supply
- Larval survival can increase 5-20 fold during nutrient pulses
- This creates the episodic, boom-bust dynamics characteristic of COTS outbreaks

CHOSEN IMPROVEMENT:
Prepared nutrient-driven recruitment enhancement mechanism using a Hill function (generalized sigmoidal response), ready to activate when nutrient data becomes available.

MATHEMATICAL FORM (currently commented out, ready for activation):
nutrient_factor = 1 + (nutrient_effect - 1) * nutrient_dat^nutrient_steepness / (nutrient_threshold^nutrient_steepness + nutrient_dat^nutrient_steepness)

Where:
- nutrient_effect: maximum recruitment multiplier during high nutrients (5-10x from literature)
- nutrient_threshold: nutrient level at half-maximal response (to be estimated from data)
- nutrient_steepness: Hill coefficient controlling response sharpness (2-5 for threshold-like outbreaks)

ECOLOGICAL REALISM:
- At low nutrients: factor ≈ 1 (baseline recruitment)
- At threshold: factor ≈ 1 + (nutrient_effect-1)/2 (half-maximal)
- At high nutrients: factor ≈ nutrient_effect (maximum enhancement)
- Steepness parameter captures the sharp threshold nature of outbreak initiation

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
- Nutrient data (nutrient_dat) is not available in the current dataset
- Model currently uses nutrient_factor = 1.0 (baseline recruitment, no nutrient effect)
- Code includes commented implementation ready to activate when nutrient data is provided
- All nutrient parameters remain in parameters.json for future use
- This approach maintains model stability while preserving the capacity to capture nutrient-driven outbreak dynamics

This mechanism directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT requirement for "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events" and will enable the model to capture the episodic nature of COTS population explosions following environmental nutrient pulses once appropriate data becomes available.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Removed nutrient_dat from DATA_VECTOR declarations (not available in current dataset)
- Set nutrient_factor = 1.0 (baseline, no enhancement)
- Included commented Hill function code for future activation
- Maintains all existing model components (Allee, temperature, predation)
- Parameters remain defined in parameters.json with appropriate bounds
- When nutrient data becomes available, uncomment Hill function and add nutrient_dat back to DATA_VECTOR
