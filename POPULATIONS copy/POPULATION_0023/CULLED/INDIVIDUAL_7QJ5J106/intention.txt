ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:

The model includes key mechanisms for COTS population dynamics (Allee effects, density-dependent mortality, temperature effects) and coral-COTS interactions (Type II functional response, selective feeding). Residuals show the model captures general trends but has systematic patterns suggesting room for improvement in boom-bust dynamics.

RESIDUAL ANALYSIS:
- COTS: Systematic over-prediction in middle periods, under-prediction in later periods
- Fast coral: Consistent under-prediction in later periods (negative residuals)
- Slow coral: Relatively good fit with minor systematic patterns

KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:

The current density-dependent mortality is linear (dd_mortality * cots_curr), which may not adequately capture the rapid crash phase of COTS outbreaks. In nature, COTS populations experience accelerating mortality at high densities due to:

1. DISEASE TRANSMISSION: Increases non-linearly with density as contact rates rise
2. RESOURCE DEPLETION: Once coral is depleted, starvation mortality accelerates rapidly
3. CANNIBALISM: Adult COTS may consume juveniles at high densities
4. WASTE ACCUMULATION: Metabolic waste products can reach toxic levels in dense aggregations

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Adding a quadratic density-dependent mortality term creates a non-linear feedback that better represents the biological reality of outbreak crashes:

- At low densities: Minimal additional mortality (linear term dominates)
- At moderate densities: Increasing mortality as density effects compound
- At high densities: Rapid population crash as multiple density-dependent factors interact

This is mathematically represented as:
density_mortality = dd_mortality_linear * cots_curr + dd_mortality_quadratic * cots_curr^2

The quadratic term captures the accelerating negative feedback that drives the characteristic rapid collapse of COTS outbreaks, creating more realistic boom-bust cycles.

IMPLEMENTATION:

Modified EQUATION 7 to include both linear and quadratic density-dependent mortality:
- Linear term (dd_mortality_linear): Represents baseline density effects (disease, competition)
- Quadratic term (dd_mortality_quadratic): Represents accelerating effects at high density (starvation, cannibalism, waste toxicity)

Added new parameter log_dd_mortality_quadratic with ecologically justified bounds:
- Should be smaller than linear term (quadratic effects emerge at higher densities)
- Range: 0.001-0.5 (log scale: -6.9 to -0.69) to prevent over-strong feedback
- Allows model to fit both gradual and rapid crash dynamics

PARAMETER INTERPRETATION:

- log_dd_mortality_linear: Baseline density-dependent mortality rate (renamed from log_dd_mortality)
- log_dd_mortality_quadratic: Accelerating density-dependent mortality coefficient
- Together these create flexible density-dependent feedback matching observed outbreak dynamics

EXPECTED OUTCOME:

The model should better capture:
- Gradual population increase during outbreak buildup (low density, weak quadratic effect)
- Rapid population crash once threshold density is reached (high density, strong quadratic effect)
- More realistic boom-bust cycle timing and magnitude
- Improved fit to COTS residuals, especially in transition periods
- Better prediction of outbreak duration and collapse timing

This improvement maintains ecological realism while adding mathematical flexibility to capture the non-linear nature of density-dependent processes in COTS population dynamics.
