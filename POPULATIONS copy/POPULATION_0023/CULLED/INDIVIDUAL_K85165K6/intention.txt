MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model includes core COTS-coral dynamics with:
- Allee effects and temperature modulation of COTS recruitment
- Two coral functional groups with competition
- Type II functional response for selective feeding
- Larval immigration pathway with nutrient-mediated survival (CURRENTLY DISABLED - awaiting nutrient data)

CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The nutrient effect on larval survival is currently hardcoded to 1.0 (no effect) because nutrient_dat is not available in the current dataset. The model has been designed to support nutrient-mediated outbreak dynamics, but this feature is temporarily disabled until nutrient forcing data becomes available.

Parameters are in place for future activation:
- log_larval_survival_efficiency parameter with non-trivial value (0.2)
- log_nutrient_half_sat parameter defined (1.0)
- log_nutrient_outbreak_threshold for threshold-based enhancement
- nutrient_outbreak_multiplier for outbreak boost
- nutrient_response_steepness for sigmoid transition

=== ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENT ===

COTS outbreak literature strongly supports nutrient-driven larval survival as a primary outbreak trigger:
1. Terrestrial runoff increases phytoplankton (larval food)
2. Enhanced larval survival leads to recruitment pulses
3. These pulses, combined with Allee effects, trigger explosive population growth
4. This creates the characteristic boom-bust pattern

The current model cannot capture this mechanism because nutrient data is not available.

=== PROPOSED CHANGES (WHEN NUTRIENT DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE) ===

1. ACTIVATE nutrient-mediated larval survival
   - Implement Michaelis-Menten response: nutrient_dat / (nutrient_half_sat + nutrient_dat)
   - This modulates the larval_survival_efficiency parameter

2. IMPLEMENT threshold-based outbreak enhancement
   - Use log_nutrient_outbreak_threshold parameter
   - Use nutrient_outbreak_multiplier parameter
   - When nutrients exceed threshold, larval survival gets additional boost
   - Represents optimal conditions for larval development and settlement

3. MATHEMATICAL FORM (to be activated):
   Base nutrient effect: N / (K_n + N)  [Michaelis-Menten]
   Threshold bonus: 1 + multiplier * (1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * (N - threshold))))  [Sigmoid]
   Combined: base_effect * threshold_bonus

This will create a non-linear response where:
- Low nutrients: poor larval survival
- Moderate nutrients: improving survival (Michaelis-Menten)
- High nutrients (>threshold): disproportionate survival boost (outbreak trigger)

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES (WHEN ACTIVATED) ===

1. Better capture of outbreak initiation timing (linked to nutrient pulses)
2. More realistic boom-bust dynamics (outbreaks when conditions are right)
3. Improved model fit to episodic outbreak patterns
4. Mechanistic link between environmental forcing and population explosions

=== CURRENT MODEL STATUS ===

The model currently operates without nutrient effects:
- Larval recruitment depends only on immigration rate and base survival efficiency
- Temperature and Allee effects still modulate local recruitment
- All nutrient-related parameters are present but not actively used
- Model is fully functional and can be fitted to data

=== PARAMETER DESCRIPTIONS ===

log_nutrient_outbreak_threshold: Log nutrient level above which outbreak enhancement occurs
- Ecological meaning: Critical nutrient concentration for optimal larval conditions
- Units: log(nutrient units)
- Reasonable range: -1.0 to 2.0 (covers 0.37 to 7.4 nutrient units)
- STATUS: Parameter exists but not currently used

nutrient_outbreak_multiplier: Additional larval survival boost during high-nutrient conditions
- Ecological meaning: Fold-increase in survival when nutrients are optimal
- Units: dimensionless
- Reasonable range: 1.0 to 5.0 (1x to 5x boost)
- STATUS: Parameter exists but not currently used

nutrient_response_steepness: Steepness of sigmoid response at nutrient outbreak threshold
- Ecological meaning: How sharply survival increases at threshold
- Units: dimensionless  
- Reasonable range: 1.0 to 10.0 (gradual to sharp transition)
- Default: 5.0 (moderately sharp)
- STATUS: Parameter exists but not currently used

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

- Nutrient effect currently set to 1.0 (neutral) until data is available
- Model maintains backward compatibility
- All existing parameters retain their roles
- New parameters have clear ecological interpretation and reasonable bounds
- When nutrient_dat becomes available, only need to uncomment the nutrient effect code block
