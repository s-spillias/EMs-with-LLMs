MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model includes age-structured COTS dynamics (juveniles and adults), temperature effects, Allee effects, nutrient-driven larval survival with outbreak thresholds, and Type II functional responses for coral predation. These components provide a foundation for modeling COTS outbreaks.

However, analysis reveals a critical missing mechanism for capturing the characteristic boom-bust outbreak dynamics emphasized in the PROJECT CONTEXT.

KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:
------------------------------
The model lacks CORAL-MEDIATED REFUGE EFFECTS on juvenile COTS survival. This is a well-documented ecological process where:

1. High coral cover provides structural complexity and hiding places for juvenile COTS
2. This refuge reduces predation mortality on juveniles (primarily from fish and invertebrates)
3. Creates a positive feedback: more coral → higher juvenile survival → more adults → more reproduction → outbreak
4. The feedback reverses during bust: coral depletion → loss of refuge → higher juvenile mortality → population crash

This mechanism is critical for explaining:
- WHY outbreaks occur when coral cover is high (not just from food availability)
- HOW populations can rapidly amplify once conditions are favorable
- THE TIMING of boom-bust cycles (linked to coral recovery/depletion)
- THE MAGNITUDE of outbreaks (exponential growth when refuge is abundant)

CURRENT PARAMETER VALUES SUPPORTING THIS CHANGE:
------------------------------------------------
- log_m_cots_juvenile = -0.693 (mortality rate ~0.5/year) is currently constant
- Coral cover data shows substantial variation (providing varying refuge quality)
- juvenile_feeding_efficiency = 0.3 shows juveniles are already treated differently from adults
- The model tracks both fast and slow coral, providing total structural complexity metric

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
--------------------
Add a CORAL-DEPENDENT JUVENILE MORTALITY MODIFIER that reduces juvenile mortality when total coral cover is high.

Mathematical form: Hyperbolic (Michaelis-Menten) response
- At low coral cover: juvenile mortality remains at baseline (high predation)
- At high coral cover: juvenile mortality is reduced by refuge effect
- Smooth transition captures gradual increase in refuge quality with coral abundance

New equation component:
refuge_effect = 1 / (1 + (K_refuge / total_coral)^refuge_steepness)
effective_juvenile_mortality = m_cots_juvenile * (1 - refuge_strength * refuge_effect)

Where:
- K_refuge: coral cover providing 50% of maximum refuge benefit (half-saturation)
- refuge_strength: maximum proportional reduction in juvenile mortality (0-1 scale)
- refuge_steepness: controls sharpness of transition (Hill coefficient)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
------------------------
1. EMPIRICAL SUPPORT: Studies show juvenile COTS survival increases 2-5x in high-complexity coral habitats
2. OUTBREAK MECHANISM: Provides the positive feedback needed to trigger exponential growth
3. BOOM-BUST DYNAMICS: Naturally creates cycles as coral is consumed and refuge is lost
4. PARAMETER PARSIMONY: Uses existing coral state variables, adds only 3 parameters
5. BIOLOGICAL REALISM: Captures well-documented predator-prey refuge effects

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
-----------------
1. Enhanced ability to capture rapid outbreak initiation when coral cover is high
2. More realistic boom-bust cycles with coral-driven feedback
3. Better prediction of outbreak timing relative to coral recovery periods
4. Improved magnitude predictions during exponential growth phase
5. Natural population crashes as coral depletion removes refuge

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" and "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events."
