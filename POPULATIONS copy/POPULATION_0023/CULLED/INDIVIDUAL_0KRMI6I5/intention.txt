MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model provides a comprehensive framework for COTS-coral dynamics with several strong features:
- Allee effects for low-density recruitment limitation
- Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response)
- Type II functional responses for coral predation with feeding preferences
- Competition between coral types
- Density-dependent mortality

However, for the PROJECT CONTEXT of modeling EPISODIC OUTBREAKS with accurate timing and magnitude, the model has a critical gap:

MISSING MECHANISM: Nutrient-driven larval recruitment pulses

The current larval recruitment uses constant efficiency:
  larval_recruitment = immigration_curr * larval_survival_base

This cannot capture the episodic nature of COTS outbreaks on the GBR, which are triggered by:
1. Flood events delivering nutrient pulses to coastal waters
2. Phytoplankton blooms from elevated nutrients
3. Dramatically increased larval survival (from ~0.01% to >1%)
4. Mass synchronized recruitment events

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT (DEFERRED) ===

The planned improvement is to add a nutrient-modulated larval survival mechanism with threshold dynamics.

ECOLOGICAL RATIONALE:
- COTS larvae require phytoplankton food for 2-3 weeks pelagic development
- Nutrient pulses (N, P from river runoff) drive phytoplankton blooms
- Larval survival is highly sensitive to food availability during critical windows
- This creates the "trigger" mechanism for outbreak initiation
- Threshold response captures the episodic (not gradual) nature of outbreaks

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION (to be implemented when nutrient data available):
Replace constant efficiency with nutrient-dependent survival:

  larval_survival = larval_survival_base + 
                    (larval_survival_max - larval_survival_base) * 
                    (nutrient^hill_coef) / (nutrient_half_sat^hill_coef + nutrient^hill_coef)

Where:
- larval_survival_base: baseline survival under low nutrients (~0.001-0.01)
- larval_survival_max: maximum survival under optimal nutrients (~0.1-1.0)
- nutrient_half_sat: nutrient concentration for 50% of maximum effect
- hill_coef: cooperativity/threshold sharpness (>1 creates threshold dynamics)

This Hill equation formulation:
- Creates saturating response (realistic biological constraint)
- Hill coefficient >1 produces threshold/switch-like behavior
- Captures the episodic recruitment pulses that drive outbreaks
- Maintains low background recruitment between events

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
Currently deferred pending availability of nutrient forcing data. The model uses constant baseline larval survival efficiency as a placeholder. When nutrient data becomes available, the following will be added:
1. nutrient_dat: DATA_VECTOR of nutrient concentrations (forcing data)
2. log_larval_survival_max: maximum survival (high nutrients)  
3. log_nutrient_half_sat: half-saturation constant
4. hill_coefficient: threshold sharpness (>1 for episodic dynamics)

=== CURRENT MODEL BEHAVIOR ===

Without nutrient modulation, the model:
- Uses constant larval survival efficiency (log_larval_survival_base)
- Can still capture some outbreak dynamics through:
  * Allee effects (positive density dependence at low densities)
  * Temperature effects (Gaussian response around optimal SST)
  * Immigration pulses (if present in cotsimm_dat forcing)
- Will NOT capture nutrient-triggered episodic recruitment pulses
- May underestimate outbreak magnitude and timing variability

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES (when nutrient mechanism added) ===

The nutrient-modulated survival mechanism should:
1. Enable sharp recruitment pulses following nutrient events
2. Create realistic boom-bust cycles with rapid population increases
3. Maintain low COTS densities between outbreak events
4. Improve model fit during outbreak initiation periods
5. Provide mechanistic link between environmental forcing and outbreak timing

The threshold dynamics (Hill coefficient >1) are key to capturing the characteristic "explosive" nature of COTS outbreaks rather than gradual population increases.
