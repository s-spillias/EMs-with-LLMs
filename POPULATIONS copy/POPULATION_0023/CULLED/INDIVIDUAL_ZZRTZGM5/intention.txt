ECOLOGICAL MODEL INTENTION: Crown-of-Thorns Starfish Outbreak Dynamics

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, capturing the characteristic boom-bust population cycles and their impacts on coral communities.

KEY ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (aggregation benefits for reproduction)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival (warmer temperatures enhance recruitment success)
   - External larval immigration events that can trigger outbreaks
   - Density-dependent mortality increasing at high population densities (resource limitation, disease)
   - Natural mortality from predation and senescence

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Two functional coral groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites)
   - Logistic growth with carrying capacity representing available substrate
   - Differential recovery rates (fast corals recover more quickly)
   - Competition for space between coral groups

3. COTS-Coral Interactions:
   - Type II functional response for COTS predation on corals
   - Preferential feeding on fast-growing Acropora (higher palatability, less defensive structures)
   - Secondary predation on slow-growing corals when fast corals are depleted
   - Predation rate increases with COTS density (aggregative feeding)

4. Environmental Forcing:
   - Sea surface temperature affects COTS larval survival and recruitment
   - Temperature stress can cause coral bleaching mortality (separate from COTS predation)
   - Larval immigration pulses from upstream reefs trigger outbreak initiation

5. Outbreak Mechanisms:
   - Outbreaks initiated by combination of: (a) larval immigration pulses, (b) favorable temperature conditions for recruitment, (c) sufficient adult COTS for Allee effect threshold
   - Outbreaks sustained by: (a) high coral availability (food resource), (b) continued recruitment from local reproduction
   - Outbreak collapse driven by: (a) coral depletion (resource limitation), (b) density-dependent mortality, (c) unfavorable environmental conditions

MODEL PREDICTIONS:
The model predicts COTS abundance, fast-growing coral cover, and slow-growing coral cover over time, capturing the observed patterns of rapid COTS population explosions (outbreaks reaching 1-3 individuals/mÂ²), subsequent coral decline (especially fast-growing species), followed by COTS population crashes and gradual coral recovery during inter-outbreak periods.
