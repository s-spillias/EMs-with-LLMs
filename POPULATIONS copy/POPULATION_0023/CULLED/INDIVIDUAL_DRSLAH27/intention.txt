MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing model captures basic COTS-coral predator-prey dynamics with several important mechanisms:
- Type II functional response for COTS feeding on fast/slow coral
- Temperature effects on COTS recruitment (Gaussian response around optimal SST)
- Allee effects at low COTS densities
- Nutrient-mediated larval survival with outbreak threshold
- Density-dependent mortality
- Competition between coral types

However, the model has a critical structural limitation for capturing episodic outbreak dynamics:

MISSING ECOLOGICAL PROCESS - AGE STRUCTURE:
The current single-pool COTS population cannot properly represent the characteristic 2-3 year lag between favorable larval settlement conditions and outbreak manifestation. In reality:
1. COTS larvae settle during favorable conditions (high nutrients, optimal temperature)
2. Juveniles grow for 2-3 years before reaching reproductive maturity
3. Cohorts mature synchronously, creating sudden population explosions
4. This maturation delay is fundamental to outbreak timing and boom-bust cycles

The current model has all COTS immediately contributing to reproduction (r_cots * cots_curr), which is ecologically unrealistic and prevents proper representation of outbreak dynamics.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Implement a two-stage age-structured COTS population:
- JUVENILES (J): Age 0-2 years, non-reproductive, settled from larvae
- ADULTS (A): Age 2+ years, reproductive, contribute to larval production

This structure will:
1. Create realistic time-lag between settlement and reproduction
2. Allow cohort dynamics where mass settlement events lead to synchronized maturation
3. Better capture boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS outbreaks
4. Maintain all existing mechanisms (Allee, temperature, nutrients, feeding) but apply them appropriately to each life stage

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Larval settlement → Juveniles (modulated by temperature, nutrients, immigration)
- Juvenile maturation → Adults (with maturation rate parameter)
- Adult reproduction → Larvae (with Allee effects on adults)
- Feeding by both juveniles and adults (juveniles feed less efficiently)
- Mortality applied to both stages (potentially different rates)

NEW PARAMETERS REQUIRED:
1. log_maturation_rate: Rate at which juveniles mature to adults (year^-1)
2. juvenile_feeding_efficiency: Relative feeding rate of juveniles vs adults (0-1)
3. log_m_cots_juvenile: Natural mortality rate for juveniles (may differ from adults)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- More realistic outbreak timing (2-3 year delay after favorable conditions)
- Better representation of boom-bust cycles
- Improved fit to observed COTS abundance patterns
- Clearer mechanistic link between environmental drivers and outbreak events

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding essential biological realism for the PROJECT CONTEXT of modeling episodic COTS outbreaks.
