MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics with:
- Logistic growth with Allee effects for COTS population
- Temperature-dependent recruitment
- Type II functional response for coral predation
- Competition between fast and slow-growing coral types

However, there is a CRITICAL GAP: The nutrient-driven outbreak mechanism is not yet implemented.

=== KEY FINDING ===

The model has well-defined nutrient response parameters ready for when nutrient data becomes available:
- log_larval_survival_efficiency: -1.609 (20% baseline survival)
- log_nutrient_half_sat: 0.0 (half-saturation = 1.0)
- log_nutrient_outbreak_threshold: 0.693 (threshold = 2.0)
- nutrient_outbreak_multiplier: 2.0 (2x boost during high nutrients)
- nutrient_response_steepness: 5.0 (sharp threshold response)

Currently: nutrient_effect is set to 1.0 (no effect) until nutrient data is added to the dataset.

=== ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENT ===

Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef are fundamentally driven by nutrient pulses:

1. TRIGGER MECHANISM: Flood events deliver terrestrial nutrients to coastal waters
2. PHYTOPLANKTON RESPONSE: Nutrients cause phytoplankton blooms
3. LARVAL SURVIVAL: COTS larvae feed on phytoplankton - blooms dramatically increase survival
4. OUTBREAK INITIATION: Enhanced larval recruitment triggers population explosion

This is THE primary mechanism for outbreak timing and magnitude - exactly what the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasizes.

Literature support:
- Brodie et al. (2005): Nutrient runoff linked to COTS outbreaks
- Fabricius et al. (2010): Chlorophyll-a (phytoplankton proxy) correlates with COTS recruitment
- Wooldridge & Brodie (2015): Flood plumes create conditions for larval survival

=== PLANNED IMPROVEMENT (WHEN NUTRIENT DATA AVAILABLE) ===

ACTIVATE THE NUTRIENT-DRIVEN OUTBREAK MECHANISM

Implementation (ready in code, awaiting data):
1. Add nutrient_dat column to the dataset
2. Add nutrient_dat to DATA_VECTOR inputs in model.cpp
3. Replace "Type nutrient_effect = Type(1.0);" with the two-stage nutrient response:

   Stage 1 - Baseline Michaelis-Menten response:
   - Captures gradual increase in survival with nutrient availability
   - Formula: nutrient / (nutrient + nutrient_half_sat)
   
   Stage 2 - Outbreak threshold response:
   - Sharp increase when nutrients exceed critical bloom threshold
   - Formula: 1 + (outbreak_multiplier - 1) × sigmoid(nutrient - threshold)
   - Sigmoid steepness controlled by nutrient_response_steepness

Combined effect will modulate larval_recruitment term in EQUATION 8.

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES (WHEN ACTIVATED) ===

This mechanism should:
1. Enable the model to capture outbreak TIMING (when nutrient pulses occur)
2. Improve outbreak MAGNITUDE prediction (proportional to nutrient pulse size)
3. Better represent outbreak DURATION (sustained by multi-year nutrient effects)
4. Create realistic boom-bust cycles driven by environmental forcing

The mechanism uses existing, well-justified parameters and adds minimal complexity while addressing the most critical gap in outbreak modeling.

=== MATHEMATICAL FORM (READY FOR ACTIVATION) ===

nutrient_effect = (nutrient_baseline_effect) × (nutrient_outbreak_boost)

Where:
- nutrient_baseline_effect = nutrient / (nutrient + nutrient_half_sat)
  [Michaelis-Menten: 0 to 1 scaling]

- nutrient_outbreak_boost = 1 + (nutrient_outbreak_multiplier - 1) × sigmoid_response
  [Adds extra boost above threshold]

- sigmoid_response = 1 / (1 + exp(-nutrient_response_steepness × (nutrient - nutrient_outbreak_threshold)))
  [Smooth threshold transition]

This creates a realistic two-phase response:
- Phase 1: Gradual increase with nutrients (normal conditions)
- Phase 2: Sharp boost when bloom threshold exceeded (outbreak conditions)

=== CURRENT STATUS ===

The model is ready to incorporate nutrient effects as soon as nutrient data (e.g., chlorophyll-a, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, or flood plume indices) becomes available. All parameters are in place and the mathematical framework is prepared in the code comments.
