MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model includes key mechanisms for COTS outbreak dynamics:
- Allee effect for outbreak initiation
- Temperature-dependent recruitment  
- Immigration enhancement
- Density-dependent mortality
- Coral predation with Type II functional response

However, critical analysis reveals a fundamental structural limitation:

PROBLEM: The model treats COTS as a single homogeneous population, but real outbreaks exhibit 
multi-year persistence (5-10 years) driven by cohort dynamics. The updated mortality parameter 
(log_mort_cots = 0.939, ~2.56 year⁻¹) from literature suggests high adult turnover, which would 
cause rapid population crashes in a single-stage model. Yet observed outbreaks persist for years.

ECOLOGICAL INSIGHT: Crown-of-Thorns starfish have a 2-3 year maturation period. During outbreaks, 
massive recruitment events create large juvenile cohorts that:
1. Don't reproduce immediately (1-2 year delay)
2. Experience lower mortality than adults
3. Create "demographic momentum" sustaining outbreaks
4. Transition to adults over time, maintaining high densities

This stage structure is THE critical mechanism for realistic boom-bust dynamics.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Two-Stage COTS Population Model ===

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Juveniles (0-2 years): Non-reproductive, lower mortality, feed on coral
- Adults (2+ years): Reproductive, higher mortality (literature value), feed on coral
- Maturation rate: ~0.5-1.0 year⁻¹ (1-2 year juvenile period)

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Split COTS population into:
- cots_juv: Juvenile density (individuals/m²)
- cots_adult: Adult density (individuals/m²)

Recruitment → Juveniles → Maturation → Adults → Mortality

This creates realistic outbreak dynamics:
1. TRIGGER: Immigration + favorable conditions → high recruitment → large juvenile cohort
2. GROWTH: Juveniles mature over 1-2 years → adult population builds
3. PEAK: Multiple overlapping cohorts → maximum adult density
4. DECLINE: Recruitment drops, juveniles deplete, adults die → crash
5. DURATION: 5-10 years from trigger to collapse (matches observations)

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- log_mort_juv: Juvenile mortality rate (lower than adults, ~0.3-0.8 year⁻¹)
- log_maturation_rate: Rate of transition from juvenile to adult (~0.5-1.0 year⁻¹)
- juv_feeding_efficiency: Relative feeding rate of juveniles vs adults (0.3-0.7)

EQUATION MODIFICATIONS:
1. Recruitment produces juveniles (not adults directly)
2. Juveniles mature at constant rate to adults
3. Both stages feed on coral (juveniles less efficiently)
4. Both stages experience density-dependent effects
5. Only adults reproduce
6. Separate mortality rates for each stage

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- Realistic multi-year outbreak persistence
- Characteristic boom-bust oscillations
- Better match to outbreak timing and duration
- Delayed population response to environmental changes
- More accurate representation of COTS life history

This single structural change addresses the core limitation preventing realistic outbreak dynamics
while maintaining all existing mechanisms (Allee effect, temperature dependence, immigration, etc.).
