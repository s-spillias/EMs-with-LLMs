MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model includes age-structured COTS dynamics with several key mechanisms:
- Juvenile and adult life stages with different mortality rates
- Coral refuge effect reducing juvenile mortality in high-coral environments
- Temperature effects on recruitment
- Nutrient-driven larval survival with outbreak threshold mechanism (currently using constant value)
- Type II functional response for coral consumption

IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
-----------------
1. DATA AVAILABILITY: Nutrient forcing data not currently available
   - Model now uses constant nutrient value (1.0) as placeholder
   - Nutrient outbreak mechanism parameters are included but inactive
   - When nutrient_dat becomes available, can be added as DATA_VECTOR

2. MISSING ECOLOGICAL PROCESS: Starvation mortality during coral depletion
   - Current model: K_cots adjusts with coral, but mortality doesn't increase sharply when food is scarce
   - Ecological reality: COTS experience mass starvation when coral is depleted during outbreaks
   - This is critical for boom-bust cycles: rapid growth → coral depletion → population crash
   - Without this, model may show unrealistic COTS persistence at high densities with low coral

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: STARVATION-DRIVEN MORTALITY
-------------------------------------------------
Add a starvation mortality term that increases when per-capita coral availability falls below 
a critical threshold. This represents:

Ecological Mechanism:
- Each COTS requires a minimum amount of coral to maintain body condition
- When total coral / total COTS falls below this threshold, mortality increases sharply
- This creates a strong negative feedback that drives population crashes after outbreaks
- Amplifies the boom-bust cycle characteristic of COTS outbreaks

Mathematical Implementation:
- Calculate per-capita coral availability: (fast_coral + slow_coral) / (juvenile + adult)
- Define critical threshold below which starvation occurs
- Use sigmoid function to create sharp mortality increase below threshold
- Add this as additional mortality term for both juveniles and adults

New Parameters:
1. log_starvation_threshold: Log critical per-capita coral availability (% coral per individual)
   - Below this, COTS experience increased mortality
   - Range: -2.303 to 1.609 (0.1 to 5.0 % per individual)
   
2. log_starvation_mortality_max: Log maximum additional mortality rate during severe starvation
   - Additional mortality when coral is completely depleted
   - Range: -0.693 to 1.609 (0.5 to 5.0 year^-1)
   
3. starvation_steepness: Steepness of starvation response
   - Controls how sharply mortality increases below threshold
   - Range: 1.0 to 10.0 (higher = sharper transition)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
-----------------
1. More realistic boom-bust dynamics with sharp population crashes
2. COTS populations cannot persist at high densities when coral is depleted
3. Recovery requires both coral regrowth AND new larval recruitment
4. Better match to observed outbreak-crash cycles on the Great Barrier Reef

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
---------------------
✓ Starvation mortality mechanism implemented
✓ Age-structured population (juveniles and adults)
✓ Coral refuge effect on juvenile mortality
✓ Temperature effects on recruitment
✓ Nutrient parameters included (awaiting data)
- Nutrient forcing  using constant value until data available
