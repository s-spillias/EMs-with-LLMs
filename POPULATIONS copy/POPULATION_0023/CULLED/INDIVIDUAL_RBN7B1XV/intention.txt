MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:
The model includes several important mechanisms for COTS-coral dynamics:
- Allee effects for outbreak initiation
- Temperature-dependent recruitment
- Density-dependent mortality
- Type II functional response with coral preference
- Competition between coral types

However, analysis reveals a critical gap in capturing episodic outbreak dynamics:

IDENTIFIED ISSUE:
The current model lacks nutrient-mediated larval survival, which is the primary trigger for episodic COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef. Literature consistently shows that outbreaks are associated with:
1. Flood events delivering nutrients to coastal waters
2. Enhanced phytoplankton production
3. Increased larval survival during the narrow spawning window
4. This creates the characteristic multi-year gaps between outbreaks

The updated mortality parameter (log_mort_cots = 0.942, very tight bounds 0.939-0.944) from literature suggests high baseline mortality (~2.56/year). Without a strong episodic recruitment boost, this high mortality would prevent realistic outbreak dynamics.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add nutrient-mediated larval survival as a multiplier on COTS recruitment. This creates a three-way interaction:
- Allee effect (existing): requires sufficient adult density
- Temperature effect (existing): requires suitable thermal conditions  
- Nutrient effect (NEW): requires elevated nutrients for larval food

Mathematical implementation:
- Add DATA_VECTOR(nutrient_dat) for nutrient proxy (river discharge, chlorophyll, etc.)
- Add log_nutrient_effect: maximum multiplier on recruitment during high nutrient conditions
- Add log_nutrient_threshold: nutrient level at which effect is half-maximal
- Add log_nutrient_steepness: controls sharpness of nutrient response

Use a saturating (Michaelis-Menten-like) response:
nutrient_factor = 1 + nutrient_effect * (nutrient_dat^steepness) / (nutrient_threshold^steepness + nutrient_dat^steepness)

This ensures:
- Baseline recruitment occurs even without nutrient pulses (factor = 1)
- Strong recruitment boost during nutrient events (factor up to 1 + nutrient_effect)
- Realistic episodic outbreak timing tied to environmental drivers
- Maintains existing Allee and temperature mechanisms

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
COTS larvae are planktotrophic and require phytoplankton food for ~2-3 weeks. Nutrient pulses from terrestrial runoff (especially during wet season) create phytoplankton blooms that dramatically increase larval survival from <1% to potentially 10-20%. This creates the episodic nature of outbreaks - they only occur when spawning coincides with nutrient availability.

This mechanism is well-documented in GBR literature and is considered the primary explanation for why outbreaks are episodic rather than continuous, and why they often follow major flood events.

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
The nutrient effect parameters have been added to the model structure and parameters.json file. However, nutrient_dat is not currently available in the data file, so the nutrient effect is currently set to 1.0 (no effect). The model will function identically to the previous version until nutrient data becomes available.

Once nutrient_dat is added to the data file, the model will automatically incorporate the nutrient-mediated recruitment mechanism without requiring code changes.

EXPECTED OUTCOME (when nutrient data is available):
The model should capture:
1. Multi-year periods with low COTS abundance
2. Rapid population explosions when nutrient, temperature, and density conditions align
3. More realistic boom-bust cycles
4. Better prediction of outbreak timing based on environmental drivers
