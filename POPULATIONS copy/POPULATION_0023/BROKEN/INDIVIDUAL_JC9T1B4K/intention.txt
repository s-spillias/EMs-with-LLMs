MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but lacks the sharp threshold behavior characteristic of episodic outbreak events. COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef are not gradual increases but rather explosive population surges triggered by specific environmental conditions.

KEY LIMITATION IDENTIFIED:
The current recruitment formulation (Equation 7) multiplies several smooth effects (temperature, Allee, resource), producing gradual changes. Real COTS outbreaks show threshold behavior where recruitment suddenly amplifies when multiple favorable conditions align simultaneously.

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:
Added a threshold-based outbreak recruitment amplification mechanism that creates sharp transitions from endemic to outbreak conditions. This is implemented through:

1. NEW PARAMETER: log_outbreak_threshold - Controls the sensitivity of the outbreak trigger
2. NEW PARAMETER: log_outbreak_amplification - Magnifies recruitment during favorable conditions

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
The outbreak trigger combines three key conditions:
- Temperature favorability (temp_effect > threshold)
- Resource availability (resource_effect > threshold) 
- Immigration pulse (normalized cotsimm > threshold)

When conditions align, recruitment is amplified by a sigmoid function that creates sharp transitions. This captures the ecological reality that COTS outbreaks require simultaneous favorable conditions across multiple factors.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- COTS larvae require specific temperature windows for survival
- High coral cover provides food for settling juveniles and adults
- Immigration pulses from upstream reefs seed local populations
- The combination creates "perfect storm" conditions for outbreaks

This modification better captures the boom-bust dynamics emphasized in the PROJECT CONTEXT, producing episodic rather than gradual population changes while maintaining ecological realism.

PARAMETER CONSIDERATIONS:
The updated log_m_cots value (0.94, very tightly constrained) suggests baseline mortality is well-established from literature. The density-dependent mortality strength was adjusted downward to prevent over-damping of outbreak dynamics given the higher baseline mortality.
