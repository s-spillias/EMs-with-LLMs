MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT STATUS: ULTRA-SIMPLIFIED BASELINE MODEL ===

The model has been drastically simplified to establish basic numerical stability.
This is the absolute minimum viable model to test if the simulation framework works.

=== CURRENT ULTRA-SIMPLIFIED MODEL ===

The model now includes ONLY the most basic mechanisms:

COTS DYNAMICS:
- Age-structured population (juveniles and adults)
- Constant mortality rates (no density dependence, no predator effects)
- Simple maturation from juvenile to adult
- Linear recruitment from immigration
- Hard bounds on population sizes (0.001 to 20 individuals/m2)

CORAL DYNAMICS:
- Two coral types (fast and slow growing)
- Simple logistic growth with shared carrying capacity
- Linear consumption by COTS (no Type II response)
- Hard bounds on coral cover (0.5% to 80% of K)

REMOVED COMPLETELY:
- Predator swamping mechanism
- Temperature effects
- Nutrient effects
- Allee effects
- Refuge effects (Hill functions)
- Type II functional responses
- Feeding preferences
- All complex conditional logic (CppAD::CondExpGt)

=== WHY THIS EXTREME SIMPLIFICATION ===

The previous models were failing to generate ADREPORT output, suggesting the
simulation loop was crashing. This ultra-simple version uses:

1. Simple if-statements with asDouble() instead of CppAD::CondExpGt
2. Hard bounds on all state variables
3. Linear relationships instead of non-linear functions
4. No multiplicative interactions between effects
5. Minimal parameter transformations

This should allow us to:
- Verify the simulation loop completes
- Confirm ADREPORT generates output
- Establish a stable baseline
- Identify which complexity causes failures

=== NEXT STEPS ===

Once this ultra-simple model runs and generates predictions:

1. Add back Type II functional response for coral consumption
2. Reintroduce refuge effects (simple linear first, then Hill)
3. Add temperature effects on recruitment
4. Restore density-dependent mortality
5. Implement predator swamping mechanism
6. Add nutrient effects
7. Restore Allee effects
8. Add feeding preferences

Each addition will be tested individually to identify what causes instability.

=== ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION (for future additions) ===

The predator swamping mechanism remains the key innovation for capturing
episodic COTS outbreaks. It will be re-added once the baseline model is stable.

The mechanism creates outbreak dynamics through:
- Baseline predation control at low COTS density
- Predator saturation as COTS density increases
- Sharp threshold for outbreak initiation
- Positive feedback during outbreak phase
- Collapse when coral refuge is depleted

This is essential for matching the observed boom-bust cycles on the Great Barrier Reef.
