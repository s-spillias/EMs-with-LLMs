MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Age-structured COTS population captures juvenile vs adult dynamics
2. Coral-dependent juvenile survival creates positive feedback for outbreaks
3. Temperature effects on recruitment reflect thermal optima
4. Nutrient-driven larval survival with outbreak threshold mechanism
5. Type II functional response for realistic feeding saturation
6. Allee effects prevent unrealistic persistence at very low densities

Weaknesses Identified:
1. No density-dependent larval settlement/recruitment limitation
2. Nutrient forcing currently defaults to constant baseline (1.0) - needs actual data
3. Potential for unrealistic exponential growth during outbreak initiation
4. Missing mechanism to naturally limit outbreak magnitude
5. Bust phase may be too abrupt without recruitment limitation

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT SELECTED ===

DENSITY-DEPENDENT LARVAL SETTLEMENT AND EARLY JUVENILE SURVIVAL

Rationale:
Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks exhibit characteristic boom-bust cycles where populations 
rapidly increase but then naturally decline even with continued favorable conditions. 
A critical missing mechanism is density-dependent limitation of larval settlement and 
early post-settlement survival.

Ecological Basis:
1. Settlement substrate limitation: At high larval densities, suitable settlement sites 
   become saturated, reducing per-capita settlement success
2. Post-settlement cannibalism: Adult and juvenile COTS consume newly settled individuals
3. Intraspecific competition: High juvenile densities lead to competition for microhabitat 
   and early food resources
4. Documented in literature: Recruitment success decreases with adult density due to 
   cannibalism and habitat pre-emption

Mathematical Implementation:
Add a Beverton-Holt type density-dependent term to juvenile recruitment:

recruitment_efficiency = 1 / (1 + (total_COTS / settlement_half_sat)^settlement_steepness)

Where:
- settlement_half_sat: COTS density at which recruitment is reduced by 50%
- settlement_steepness: Controls how sharply recruitment declines with density
- total_COTS: Combined juvenile + adult density (both compete for settlement sites)

This modification:
- Allows rapid outbreak initiation at low densities (high per-capita recruitment)
- Naturally limits outbreak magnitude (recruitment saturates at high density)
- Promotes bust phase (reduced recruitment even with high adult fecundity)
- Creates realistic boom-bust cycles without arbitrary thresholds
- Maintains ecological realism with well-documented mechanisms

Expected Impact on Model Dynamics:
1. More realistic outbreak peaks (self-limiting rather than exponential)
2. Smoother transitions between boom and bust phases
3. Better capture of outbreak duration (sustained high density with declining recruitment)
4. Improved prediction of outbreak magnitude variability
5. Natural recovery dynamics as density declines and recruitment efficiency recovers

=== PARAMETERS ADDED ===

1. log_settlement_half_sat: Log COTS density (individuals/m2) at which settlement 
   efficiency is reduced by 50%. Range: 0.1-2.0 ind/m2 (log: -2.303 to 0.693)
   
2. settlement_steepness: Steepness of density-dependent recruitment decline. 
   Range: 1.0-4.0 (1=gradual, 4=sharp threshold). Higher values create more 
   dramatic boom-bust cycles.

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

The density-dependent settlement term is applied to juvenile recruitment in the 
time loop, affecting both local reproduction and immigration-derived recruitment. 
This ensures that all sources of new juveniles experience the same density-dependent 
limitation, which is ecologically realistic (settlement substrate and cannibalism 
affect all settlers equally regardless of larval origin).

The term uses total COTS density (juveniles + adults) because:
- Adults consume settling larvae (cannibalism)
- Juveniles compete for settlement substrate and microhabitat
- Both contribute to habitat pre-emption

This single modification addresses the most critical gap in capturing episodic 
outbreak dynamics while maintaining model parsimony and ecological interpretability.
