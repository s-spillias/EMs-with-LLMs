# Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

## Current Model Evaluation

The model includes comprehensive COTS-coral dynamics with:
- Allee effects and density dependence in COTS population
- Temperature-dependent recruitment
- Immigration effects
- Type II functional responses for predation
- Outbreak trigger mechanism based on composite favorability

## Key Issue Identified

The current outbreak mechanism (Equations 11-14) has a structural problem:
- Uses geometric mean of three favorability indices (temperature, immigration, food)
- Applies amplification uniformly to ALL growth terms (adult growth + conversion)
- This is ecologically unrealistic because COTS outbreaks are RECRUITMENT-DRIVEN events

**Ecological Reality**: 
Outbreaks occur when massive pulses of larvae settle and survive to adulthood under favorable conditions. This is fundamentally different from existing adults suddenly growing faster or converting food more efficiently.

**Problem with Current Approach**:
- Geometric mean requires ALL three conditions to be simultaneously high (very restrictive)
- Amplifies adult logistic growth, which doesn't reflect recruitment biology
- Amplifies conversion efficiency, which shouldn't change during outbreaks
- Could theoretically trigger outbreaks without good recruitment conditions

## Proposed Improvement: Dedicated Recruitment Pulse Mechanism

**Change**: Replace uniform outbreak amplification with a separate recruitment pulse term that adds new individuals when conditions favor larval settlement and early juvenile survival.

**Ecological Justification**:
1. Outbreaks begin with episodic mass recruitment events (10-100x normal recruitment)
2. Requires alignment of: warm SST (larval development), high immigration (larval supply), adequate food (juvenile survival)
3. Factors can partially compensate (e.g., very high immigration can overcome slightly suboptimal temperature)
4. Recruitment pulses are discrete events, not continuous processes

**Mathematical Implementation**:
- Create dedicated recruitment flux term: R_pulse
- Use MULTIPLICATIVE favorability (allows partial compensation): F_temp × F_immigration × F_food
- Apply sigmoidal threshold activation (captures episodic nature)
- Scale by maximum potential recruitment rate
- Add to population as new individuals (not as growth multiplier)

**New Parameters**:
1. `log_recruit_max`: Maximum recruitment rate during pulse events (individuals/m²/year)
   - Ecological meaning: Peak recruitment when all conditions optimal
   - Bounds: -1.0 to 2.0 (corresponds to 0.37 to 7.4 individuals/m²/year)
   
2. `recruit_threshold`: Composite favorability threshold for recruitment pulse activation (0-1)
   - Ecological meaning: Minimum combined favorability needed to trigger mass recruitment
   - Bounds: 0.4 to 0.8 (middle range ensures selectivity)

**Removed Parameters**:
- `outbreak_threshold`: Replaced by `recruit_threshold` (more specific meaning)
- `outbreak_strength`: Replaced by `log_recruit_max` (mechanistically clearer)

**Modified Equations**:
- Remove outbreak amplifier from Equation 14
- Add new recruitment pulse calculation
- Modify COTS growth equation to include recruitment as additive term

**Expected Improvements**:
1. More realistic outbreak initiation (recruitment-based)
2. Better timing of outbreak onset (when conditions align for larvae)
3. Clearer separation of adult vs. juvenile dynamics
4. More flexible favorability assessment (multiplicative allows compensation)
5. Episodic nature better captured through threshold activation

This change maintains model complexity while improving ecological realism and mechanistic clarity for the boom-bust dynamics central to the PROJECT CONTEXT.
