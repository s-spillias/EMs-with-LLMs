Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) Outbreak Model with Coral Community Dynamics

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) on the Great Barrier Reef and their impacts on coral communities. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS populations rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline.

Key Ecological Processes:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (aggregation benefits for reproduction)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival (warmer temperatures enhance recruitment success)
   - External larval immigration from upstream reefs (episodic pulse events)
   - Natural mortality increasing with density (resource limitation, disease)
   - Carrying capacity determined by available coral prey

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Two functional groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites)
   - Logistic growth with different intrinsic rates reflecting life history strategies
   - Selective predation by COTS with Type II functional responses
   - Preferential consumption of fast-growing corals when abundant
   - Competition for space between coral groups

3. Outbreak Triggers and Mechanisms:
   - Elevated sea surface temperatures enhance larval survival
   - Immigration pulses seed local populations
   - Allee effects create threshold dynamics (outbreaks occur when density exceeds critical threshold)
   - High coral cover (especially fast-growing species) supports population growth
   - Feedback loop: COTS reduce coral, limiting future carrying capacity

4. Boom-Bust Cycle Mechanisms:
   - Boom phase: Favorable temperatures + immigration + high coral cover â†’ rapid COTS increase
   - Peak phase: COTS reach high densities, intense coral predation
   - Bust phase: Coral depletion reduces carrying capacity, density-dependent mortality increases
   - Recovery phase: Low COTS allow coral recovery, setting stage for next outbreak

The model uses lognormal observation errors to account for the highly variable and skewed nature of COTS abundance and coral cover data. Temperature and immigration are treated as external forcing variables.
