MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a coupled COTS-coral system with predator-prey dynamics, temperature effects, and Allee effects. However, it does not adequately capture the episodic nature of COTS outbreaks emphasized in the PROJECT CONTEXT.

Key Issues Identified:
1. Recruitment is modeled as continuous logistic growth rather than episodic pulses
2. The Allee effect formulation may not produce strong enough threshold behavior
3. Immigration effects are additive rather than multiplicative/synergistic
4. No explicit mechanism for outbreak triggering beyond general population growth
5. Temperature effects use simple Gaussian rather than asymmetric response

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: RECRUITMENT PULSE MECHANISM ===

Rationale:
COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef are characterized by massive, episodic recruitment events rather than gradual population increases. These recruitment pulses occur when multiple favorable conditions align:
- Optimal temperature windows (27-29°C) for larval development
- Sufficient adult density for successful fertilization (Allee effect)
- High larval immigration from connectivity with upstream outbreak reefs
- Nutrient availability (implicitly captured through temperature as proxy for seasonal conditions)

The current model treats recruitment as a continuous process. This fails to capture:
- The threshold nature of outbreaks (conditions must exceed critical levels)
- Synergistic interactions between favorable conditions
- The concentration of recruitment in specific favorable years
- The explosive growth characteristic of outbreak initiation

Proposed Changes:

1. ENHANCED ALLEE EFFECT (Modified Equation 1):
   Replace the current weak Allee formulation with a stronger threshold-based function:
   - Use a Hill function (cooperative binding model) to create sharper threshold
   - Parameter: allee_hill_coefficient (controls steepness of threshold)
   - This produces minimal recruitment below threshold, rapid increase near threshold

2. RECRUITMENT THRESHOLD MECHANISM (New Equation):
   Add explicit recruitment success probability based on multiple conditions:
   - Temperature must be within optimal range
   - Adult density must exceed Allee threshold
   - Immigration must be sufficient
   - All conditions must be simultaneously favorable (multiplicative)
   - Parameter: recruitment_threshold_temp (temperature range for recruitment)
   - Parameter: recruitment_threshold_immigration (minimum immigration for pulse)

3. SYNERGISTIC RECRUITMENT AMPLIFICATION (Modified Equation 3):
   Replace additive immigration effect with multiplicative synergy:
   - When all conditions favorable, recruitment amplified non-linearly
   - Parameter: recruitment_synergy (amplification when conditions align)
   - This captures the explosive nature of outbreak initiation

4. ASYMMETRIC TEMPERATURE RESPONSE (Modified Equation 2):
   Replace symmetric Gaussian with asymmetric function:
   - Temperatures above optimal more detrimental than below
   - Reflects physiological stress at high temperatures
   - Uses updated literature values for optimal temperature (28°C)

Expected Outcomes:
- Better capture of episodic outbreak timing
- More realistic boom-bust dynamics with sharp transitions
- Improved representation of outbreak magnitude
- Better prediction of outbreak duration through resource depletion feedback

Implementation:
- Add 3 new parameters to parameters.json with ecological justification
- Modify Equations 1, 2, 3 in model.cpp
- Add new equation for recruitment threshold calculation
- Maintain all existing mechanisms (predation, temperature stress, etc.)

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT requirement to accurately capture "timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" through mechanistic representation of outbreak triggers.
