MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model captures many key COTS outbreak mechanisms:
- Allee effects at low density
- Temperature-dependent recruitment
- Larval immigration effects
- Density-dependent mortality
- Differential predation on coral types
- Recruitment pulse mechanism

However, there is a CRITICAL ECOLOGICAL FLAW in Equation 13 (substrate_food_favorability):

PROBLEM: The current unimodal relationship peaks at ~30% coral cover and declines at both low and high coral. This creates an unrealistic negative feedback where:
1. COTS outbreak reduces coral cover
2. Low coral reduces substrate_food_favorability
3. Recruitment drops, preventing outbreak persistence
4. Outbreak self-terminates prematurely

This contradicts observed COTS outbreak dynamics where populations persist for 2-3 years even as they devastate coral communities down to <10% cover.

=== ECOLOGICAL INSIGHT ===

The flaw stems from conflating TWO DISTINCT ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

1. LARVAL SETTLEMENT SUBSTRATE:
   - COTS larvae settle primarily on crustose coralline algae (CCA)
   - CCA availability INCREASES when coral cover is LOW (less competition)
   - Settlement is actually FAVORED by low-moderate coral cover
   - High coral cover reduces CCA availability (coral overgrows CCA)

2. POST-SETTLEMENT FOOD REQUIREMENTS:
   - Juvenile COTS (0-6 months) are dietary generalists
   - Feed on biofilm, detritus, algae, and small coral fragments
   - Can survive and grow even when coral cover is low
   - Only require minimal coral presence
   
3. ADULT FOOD REQUIREMENTS:
   - Adults require substantial coral for growth and reproduction
   - Food limitation only becomes critical at very low coral (<5%)
   - This is what eventually terminates outbreaks

=== PROPOSED SOLUTION ===

DECOUPLE settlement substrate from food availability by creating TWO SEPARATE COMPONENTS:

1. SETTLEMENT FAVORABILITY (inverse relationship with coral):
   - High when coral is low (more CCA exposed)
   - Decreases as coral cover increases (CCA overgrown)
   - Mathematical form: exponential decay with coral cover
   - This allows continued recruitment during outbreak

2. FOOD AVAILABILITY (threshold relationship):
   - Adequate above a minimum coral threshold (~5-10%)
   - Only becomes limiting at very low coral
   - Mathematical form: sigmoidal function with low threshold
   - This creates outbreak collapse only when coral is critically depleted

3. COMPOSITE FAVORABILITY:
   - Multiplicative combination: temperature × immigration × settlement × food
   - Settlement component dominates at moderate-high coral
   - Food component only limits at very low coral
   - Creates realistic outbreak persistence followed by eventual collapse

=== EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS ===

This modification should produce more realistic outbreak dynamics:

1. OUTBREAK INITIATION: Still requires favorable conditions (temperature, immigration, moderate coral)

2. OUTBREAK PERSISTENCE: Can continue even as coral declines from 30% to 10%, because:
   - Settlement substrate (CCA) remains available or increases
   - Juvenile food requirements are minimal
   - Adult reproduction continues with available coral

3. OUTBREAK COLLAPSE: Only occurs when coral drops below critical threshold (~5%), causing:
   - Adult starvation
   - Reduced fecundity
   - Recruitment failure
   - Population crash

4. BOOM-BUST CYCLES: Natural emergence from predator-prey dynamics without artificial constraints

=== IMPLEMENTATION ===

Modified equations in recruitment pulse mechanism:
- Replace single substrate_food_favorability with two components
- Add settlement_favorability (decreases with coral)
- Add food_availability (threshold at low coral)
- Update composite favorability index
- Adjust parameter descriptions and bounds

This change maintains model parsimony while fixing a critical ecological misrepresentation that was preventing realistic outbreak dynamics.
