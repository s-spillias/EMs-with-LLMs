MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Comprehensive representation of COTS-coral predator-prey dynamics
- Includes Allee effects, temperature responses, and density dependence
- Captures prey switching between fast and slow coral types
- Implements Type II functional responses for realistic predation saturation

Weaknesses:
1. MISSING CRITICAL OUTBREAK TRIGGER: The model lacks explicit representation of nutrient-enhanced larval recruitment, which is the primary mechanism driving episodic COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef
2. Current outbreak drivers (temperature, immigration) are insufficient to explain the characteristic boom-bust cycles
3. Immigration term is a proxy but doesn't capture the mechanistic link between environmental conditions (river runoff → nutrients → phytoplankton → larval food) and recruitment success

Parameter Considerations:
- Updated log_temp_opt (3.3495 ≈ 28.4°C) and log_temp_stress_threshold (3.367 = 29°C) are very close
- This narrow window may cause simultaneous COTS recruitment enhancement and coral stress at similar temperatures
- This is actually ecologically realistic for GBR conditions where warm years favor COTS while stressing corals

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT (DEFERRED) ===

Add Nutrient-Enhanced Larval Survival Mechanism

Ecological Justification:
Extensive research on GBR COTS outbreaks (Brodie et al., Fabricius et al., Wooldridge) demonstrates that:
- Elevated nutrient levels from terrestrial runoff (especially during wet seasons) increase phytoplankton production
- Enhanced phytoplankton availability dramatically increases larval survival during the critical 2-4 week pelagic phase
- This creates a mechanistic link between environmental conditions and outbreak timing
- Outbreaks are episodic because they require the coincidence of: (1) nutrient pulses, (2) favorable temperatures, (3) sufficient adult populations for spawning

Mathematical Implementation (when nutrient data becomes available):
Add a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) response function for nutrient effects on larval recruitment:

nutrient_effect = (nutrient * nutrient_sensitivity) / (nutrient_half_sat + nutrient + eps)

This captures:
- Linear response at low nutrient levels
- Saturation at high levels (physiological limits to larval survival improvement)
- Threshold behavior that can trigger outbreaks when nutrients exceed critical levels

Required Components (for future implementation):
1. DATA_VECTOR: nutrient_dat - time series of nutrient concentration (e.g., chlorophyll-a as proxy, or modeled nutrient load)
2. PARAMETER: log_nutrient_sensitivity - maximum fold-increase in larval survival due to nutrients
3. PARAMETER: log_nutrient_half_sat - nutrient concentration at half-maximal effect (Michaelis constant)

Integration Plan:
Modify EQUATION 11 (COTS population growth) to include nutrient_effect as a multiplier on recruitment term, alongside existing temperature and Allee effects. This creates a multi-factor recruitment model where outbreaks require alignment of multiple favorable conditions.

Expected Outcomes:
- Better capture of episodic outbreak timing linked to environmental drivers
- More realistic boom-bust dynamics with clear triggering mechanisms
- Improved prediction of outbreak magnitude based on nutrient pulse intensity
- Maintains existing ecological realism while adding critical missing process

=== CURRENT STATUS ===

The nutrient enhancement mechanism has been removed from the active model because nutrient data (nutrient_dat) is not currently available in the dataset. The model has been reverted to use only temperature and immigration as outbreak drivers. Once nutrient data becomes available, the mechanism can be re-implemented following the plan outlined above.

The current model remains functional and captures the basic COTS-coral dynamics, but lacks the mechanistic explanation for outbreak triggering that nutrient data would provide.
