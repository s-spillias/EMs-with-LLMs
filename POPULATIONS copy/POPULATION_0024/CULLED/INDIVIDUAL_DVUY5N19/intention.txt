MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Implements sophisticated Allee effect with Hill function for sharp outbreak thresholds
- Captures temperature-dependent recruitment and coral stress
- Models prey switching between fast and slow coral
- Includes synergistic recruitment amplification when conditions align

Potential Limitations:
- Allee effect may be too restrictive for metapopulation dynamics
- Immigration effect is additive/multiplicative but doesn't rescue populations from Allee trap
- Missing explicit mechanism for how external larval supply triggers local outbreaks
- Fixed baseline mortality (from literature) requires better balance with recruitment

Key Parameter Update:
- log_mort_base now tightly constrained (-1.204 to -1.204) from literature
- This fixed mortality emphasizes need for flexible recruitment mechanisms

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: IMMIGRATION RESCUE FROM ALLEE THRESHOLD ===

Rationale:
Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks on the GBR are fundamentally driven by larval connectivity 
between reefs. A critical missing mechanism is the "rescue effect" where high larval 
immigration can overcome local Allee thresholds and initiate outbreaks even when 
resident populations are below critical density.

Ecological Justification:
1. Spatial coupling: Downstream reefs receive larval pulses from upstream outbreak sources
2. Allee bypass: Immigrant larvae don't require local mating aggregations
3. Threshold crossing: Immigration provides "seed population" to jump-start local outbreaks
4. Episodic dynamics: Explains how outbreaks can suddenly appear on previously low-density reefs

Mathematical Implementation:
Modified Allee effect calculation to include immigration rescue:

OLD APPROACH (Equation 1):
- Allee factor based solely on local resident density
- density_ratio = cots_prev / allee_threshold
- Immigration only affects growth multiplicatively later

NEW APPROACH:
- Effective density includes both residents AND immigrants
- effective_density = cots_prev + immigration_rescue_strength * immigration
- density_ratio = effective_density / allee_threshold
- This allows immigration to directly overcome Allee threshold

New Parameter:
- immigration_rescue_strength: Scales how effectively immigrants contribute to 
  overcoming Allee threshold (dimensionless, 0-10)
- Lower bound: 0 (no rescue effect)
- Upper bound: 10 (strong rescue, immigrants count fully toward threshold)
- Initial value: 2.0 (moderate rescue effect)

Expected Outcomes:
1. Better capture outbreak initiation on reefs receiving larval influx
2. More realistic boom-bust cycles driven by spatial connectivity
3. Improved prediction of outbreak timing and magnitude
4. Maintains sharp threshold behavior but adds immigration pathway

This single modification addresses the core PROJECT CONTEXT requirement of accurately
capturing "the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" by providing
a mechanistic pathway for outbreak initiation through larval connectivity.
