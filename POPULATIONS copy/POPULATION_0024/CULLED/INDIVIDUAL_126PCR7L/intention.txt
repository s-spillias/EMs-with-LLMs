MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a comprehensive COTS-coral system with:
1. COTS population dynamics with Allee effects, temperature dependence, and immigration
2. Recruitment pulse mechanism for episodic outbreaks (Equations 11-17)
3. Dome-shaped density-dependent recruitment facilitation (Equation 16)
4. Two coral functional groups with differential predation vulnerability
5. Type II functional responses with prey switching

=== IDENTIFIED ISSUE ===

The recruitment pulse mechanism (Equations 11-17) uses a MULTIPLICATIVE favorability index:
  favorability_index = temp_favorability × immigration_favorability × food_favorability

This formulation is ecologically problematic because:

1. **Overly restrictive**: Requires ALL three factors to be simultaneously high for outbreaks
   - If any single factor is 0.5, the product drops to ≤0.125 (well below threshold of 0.6)
   - Makes outbreaks extremely rare and sensitive to any single limiting factor

2. **Contradicts COTS ecology**: Literature distinguishes two outbreak pathways:
   - PRIMARY outbreaks: Nutrient pulses (flood events) enhance larval survival locally
   - SECONDARY outbreaks: High larval immigration from upstream outbreak reefs
   - These pathways can operate INDEPENDENTLY, not requiring both simultaneously

3. **Temperature role misrepresented**: Temperature is more of a permissive factor (broad tolerance)
   rather than a strict requirement. COTS recruit across a wide temperature range (26-30°C).

4. **Parameter values suggest structural mismatch**: 
   - recruit_threshold = 0.6 is high for a multiplicative index
   - This combination makes the model unable to capture observed outbreak frequencies

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Replace the multiplicative favorability index with a COMPENSATORY (additive with saturation) formulation
that allows multiple pathways to trigger outbreaks:

**New Equation Structure**:
Instead of: favorability = temp × immigration × food

Use: favorability = temp_permissive × [food_pathway + immigration_pathway - food_pathway × immigration_pathway]

Where:
- temp_permissive: Broad permissive window (not restrictive)
- food_pathway: Sigmoidal response to local food availability (primary outbreak pathway)
- immigration_pathway: Sigmoidal response to larval supply (secondary outbreak pathway)
- The combined term [A + B - A×B] ensures saturation at 1.0 while allowing either pathway alone to trigger outbreaks

**Ecological Justification**:
1. **Primary outbreaks**: High food availability alone can trigger outbreaks (flood-driven)
2. **Secondary outbreaks**: High immigration alone can trigger outbreaks (connectivity-driven)
3. **Synergistic effects**: When both occur, effect is enhanced but not multiplicative
4. **Temperature as gate**: Broad permissive effect rather than narrow optimum requirement

**Mathematical Benefits**:
- Each pathway can independently reach threshold (more realistic outbreak frequency)
- Pathways show diminishing returns (ecological saturation)
- Temperature acts as a gate (0 when too cold, ~1 when suitable) rather than a peak requirement
- Maintains smooth differentiability for optimization

**New Parameters**:
- food_pathway_steepness: Controls how sharply food availability triggers primary outbreaks
- food_pathway_threshold: Food level at which primary outbreak pathway is half-activated
- immigration_pathway_steepness: Controls how sharply immigration triggers secondary outbreaks  
- immigration_pathway_threshold: Immigration level at which secondary outbreak pathway is half-activated
- temp_lower_threshold: Minimum temperature for COTS recruitment (permissive lower bound)
- temp_upper_threshold: Maximum temperature for COTS recruitment (permissive upper bound)

These replace the less mechanistic temp_opt, temp_width, and recruit_threshold parameters.

**Expected Outcomes**:
1. More realistic outbreak frequencies matching observed boom-bust cycles
2. Ability to capture both primary (nutrient-driven) and secondary (connectivity-driven) outbreaks
3. Better representation of the multiple pathways to COTS population explosions
4. Improved model fit to data showing episodic outbreak patterns

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

- Remove old parameters: log_temp_opt, log_temp_width, recruit_threshold
- Add new parameters: food_pathway_steepness, food_pathway_threshold, immigration_pathway_steepness,
  immigration_pathway_threshold, log_temp_lower_threshold, log_temp_upper_threshold
- Modify Equations 11-15 to implement compensatory pathway structure
- Keep density facilitation mechanism (Equation 16) as it addresses a different ecological process
- Maintain all other model components unchanged
