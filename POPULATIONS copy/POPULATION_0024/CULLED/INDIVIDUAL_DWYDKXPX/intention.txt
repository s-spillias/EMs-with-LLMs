MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Comprehensive representation of COTS-coral interactions
- Includes temperature effects, Allee effects, and functional responses
- Separate treatment of fast and slow-growing corals
- Larval immigration as external forcing

Weaknesses for PROJECT CONTEXT:
1. Settlement dynamics too gradual - doesn't capture explosive outbreak initiation
2. Gregarious settlement increases monotonically with density, lacking threshold behavior
3. Multiple favorable conditions (high immigration, suitable temperature, available substrate, conspecific cues) are treated additively rather than synergistically
4. Missing the "perfect storm" mechanism that triggers episodic outbreaks in nature

=== ECOLOGICAL RATIONALE FOR IMPROVEMENT ===

COTS outbreaks on the GBR are characterized by:
- Sudden population explosions (not gradual increases)
- Requirement for multiple simultaneous favorable conditions
- Threshold-driven dynamics where small changes can trigger large responses
- Boom-bust cycles with rapid growth followed by collapse

The current model treats favorable conditions as independent multipliers. In reality, COTS outbreaks require a SYNERGISTIC alignment of conditions:
- High larval supply (immigration pulses)
- Suitable settlement substrate (coral availability)
- Optimal temperature windows
- Conspecific attraction exceeding critical density

When ALL conditions are favorable simultaneously, settlement success should be dramatically enhanced (outbreak). When any condition is limiting, settlement remains low (non-outbreak).

=== PROPOSED MODIFICATION ===

Replace the current additive/multiplicative settlement model (Equations 4-8) with a SYNERGISTIC OUTBREAK TRIGGER mechanism:

1. Convert each favorable condition into a threshold function (0 to 1 scale)
2. Multiply these threshold functions to create synergistic interaction
3. Add a new parameter "outbreak_threshold" that determines the combined condition level needed for outbreak
4. Use a steep sigmoidal function to create explosive settlement when threshold is exceeded

Mathematical approach:
- Substrate threshold: S(substrate) = substrate^n / (substrate^n + K_substrate^n)
- Immigration threshold: I(immigration) = immigration^n / (immigration^n + K_immigration^n)  
- Temperature threshold: T(temp) = exp(-((temp - opt)/width)^2) with steeper falloff
- Gregarious threshold: G(density) = (density/K_greg)^n / (1 + (density/K_greg)^n)
- Synergy: settlement_trigger = (S * I * T * G)^cooperativity
- Outbreak occurs when settlement_trigger > outbreak_threshold

This creates:
- Episodic dynamics (threshold-driven)
- Boom-bust cycles (rapid growth when triggered, collapse when conditions deteriorate)
- Realistic outbreak timing (requires alignment of multiple factors)
- Emergent complexity from simple mechanistic rules

=== NEW PARAMETERS ===

1. outbreak_cooperativity (dimensionless, 2-5): Controls steepness of outbreak response
   - Higher values = more explosive outbreaks
   - Literature suggests COTS outbreaks are highly nonlinear

2. log_substrate_threshold (log individuals/m²): Half-saturation for substrate limitation
   - Determines how much coral is needed for successful settlement

3. log_immigration_threshold (log individuals/m²/year): Half-saturation for immigration effect
   - Determines larval supply needed to trigger outbreak

4. settlement_hill_coefficient (dimensionless, 2-4): Hill coefficient for threshold functions
   - Controls sharpness of each individual threshold
   - Higher = more switch-like behavior

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

- Better capture of episodic outbreak timing
- More realistic boom-bust population dynamics
- Improved prediction of outbreak magnitude and duration
- Emergent threshold behavior from mechanistic processes
- Maintained biological realism with clear ecological interpretation
