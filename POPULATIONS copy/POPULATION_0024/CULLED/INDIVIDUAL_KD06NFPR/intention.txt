MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a comprehensive COTS-coral predator-prey system with several sophisticated mechanisms:
- Allee effects for COTS population dynamics at low densities
- Temperature-dependent recruitment and coral stress
- Type II functional responses for predation with prey switching
- Recruitment pulse mechanism for outbreak initiation
- Density-dependent mortality

The recruitment pulse mechanism (Equations 11-16) is the primary driver of outbreak events, combining temperature, immigration, and coral cover favorability.

=== IDENTIFIED ISSUE ===

The current substrate-food favorability function (Equation 13) uses a single unimodal curve:
  f(x) = (x/x_opt) * exp(1 - x/x_opt)

This creates a symmetric peak around optimal_coral (~30%), but ecological evidence indicates COTS recruitment involves TWO DISTINCT PHASES with different coral cover requirements:

1. LARVAL SETTLEMENT PHASE:
   - Larvae preferentially settle on crustose coralline algae (CCA) and bare substrate
   - High coral cover REDUCES available settlement substrate (coral overgrows CCA)
   - Settlement success should DECREASE with coral cover

2. POST-SETTLEMENT SURVIVAL PHASE:
   - Newly settled juveniles require coral polyps as food
   - Very low coral cover = starvation of juveniles
   - Survival should INCREASE with coral cover (up to saturation)

The parameter log_optimal_coral has been updated from literature with description emphasizing this "tradeoff between substrate limitation at high coral cover and food limitation at low coral cover." However, the current single-peak mathematical formulation doesn't adequately represent this as a MULTIPLICATIVE bottleneck where BOTH phases must succeed.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Replace the single unimodal function with a TWO-COMPONENT model that explicitly separates:

1. SETTLEMENT COMPONENT (decreasing with coral cover):
   settlement_success = exp(-coral_cover / settlement_scale)
   
   Where settlement_scale controls how quickly settlement declines with coral cover.
   At 0% coral: maximum settlement (100% CCA available)
   At high coral: minimal settlement (CCA overgrown)

2. JUVENILE SURVIVAL COMPONENT (saturating with coral cover):
   juvenile_survival = coral_cover / (survival_threshold + coral_cover)
   
   Where survival_threshold is the coral cover needed for 50% maximum survival.
   At 0% coral: no survival (starvation)
   At high coral: saturates (sufficient food)

3. COMBINED RECRUITMENT FAVORABILITY:
   substrate_food_favorability = settlement_success * juvenile_survival

This multiplicative formulation creates an emergent optimal coral cover where BOTH processes are reasonably successful, but the shape is asymmetric and mechanistically grounded. It better explains why COTS outbreaks typically initiate during coral RECOVERY phases (10-40% cover) rather than at peak coral abundance (>50% cover).

=== NEW PARAMETERS ===

Two new parameters replace the single log_optimal_coral:

1. log_settlement_scale: Controls how rapidly settlement success declines with coral cover
   - Lower values = settlement more sensitive to coral cover
   - Typical range: 15-40% coral cover for e-folding
   - Initial estimate: log(25) ≈ 3.22

2. log_survival_threshold: Coral cover needed for 50% juvenile survival
   - Represents minimum food requirement for juveniles
   - Typical range: 5-20% coral cover
   - Initial estimate: log(10) ≈ 2.30

These parameters are more mechanistically interpretable than a single "optimal" value and allow the model to better capture the ecological processes driving outbreak initiation timing.

=== EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS ===

1. Better representation of why outbreaks occur during coral recovery, not at peak coral
2. More realistic asymmetric relationship between coral cover and recruitment success
3. Mechanistically grounded parameters that can be constrained by field observations of settlement and juvenile survival
4. Improved prediction of outbreak timing relative to coral community state
5. Better capture of the characteristic lag between coral recovery and outbreak initiation

This change maintains model complexity at a similar level (2 parameters instead of 1) while providing stronger ecological foundation for the recruitment pulse mechanism that drives outbreak dynamics.
