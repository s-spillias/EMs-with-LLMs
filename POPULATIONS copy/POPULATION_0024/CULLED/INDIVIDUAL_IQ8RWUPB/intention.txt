MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model incorporates sophisticated outbreak dynamics including:
- Threshold-based recruitment amplification (Hill function)
- Immigration-local reproduction interactions
- Allee effects at low density
- Temperature modulation of recruitment
- Predator-prey dynamics with prey switching

However, analysis reveals a critical oversimplification in how coral availability affects COTS recruitment success.

=== IDENTIFIED ISSUE ===

Equation 6 (resource-recruitment coupling) uses a LINEAR relationship:
  coral_facilitation = total_coral / (K_coral + eps)
  resource_effect = 1 - coupling + coupling * coral_facilitation

This implies that recruitment success increases proportionally with coral cover from 0% to 100%. 

ECOLOGICAL REALITY: Recruitment success should show a SATURATING response:
1. At very low coral (<10-15%), recruitment fails - insufficient food for settling larvae and juveniles
2. At moderate coral (15-40%), recruitment success increases rapidly - adequate resources available
3. At high coral (>40%), recruitment saturates - other factors (space, predation) become limiting

This nonlinearity is critical for episodic outbreak dynamics because it creates a CRITICAL CORAL THRESHOLD below which outbreaks cannot initiate, even with high larval supply.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Replace linear coral-recruitment relationship with MICHAELIS-MENTEN SATURATION:

  resource_effect = (total_coral^h) / (K_half^h + total_coral^h)

Where:
- K_half = half-saturation constant (coral cover at 50% recruitment success)
- h = Hill coefficient controlling steepness of transition

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Creates realistic threshold below which recruitment fails
2. Rapid transition zone matches observed outbreak initiation dynamics
3. Saturation at high coral reflects other limiting factors
4. Better captures boom-bust cycles tied to coral recovery

MATHEMATICAL ADVANTAGES:
1. Bounded between 0 and 1 (no need for coupling parameter)
2. Clear biological interpretation of K_half
3. Flexible steepness via Hill coefficient
4. Standard form in ecological modeling

PARAMETER CHANGES:
- REMOVE: resource_recruitment_coupling (replaced by functional form)
- ADD: log_K_half_coral (half-saturation for recruitment, ~20-30% coral cover)
- ADD: coral_recruitment_hill (Hill coefficient, ~2-4 for moderate steepness)

This improvement maintains model complexity while providing more realistic outbreak dynamics that better match the PROJECT CONTEXT of episodic, coral-dependent COTS outbreaks.

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

1. Sharper distinction between outbreak-permissive and outbreak-resistant coral states
2. Better prediction of outbreak timing relative to coral recovery cycles
3. More realistic representation of the coral threshold needed for outbreak initiation
4. Improved capture of boom-bust dynamics where outbreaks collapse as they deplete coral below critical levels
