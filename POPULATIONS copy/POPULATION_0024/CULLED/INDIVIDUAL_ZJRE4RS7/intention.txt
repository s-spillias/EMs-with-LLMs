# Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

## Current Model Evaluation

The model implements a comprehensive COTS-coral system with:
- Allee effects and density dependence in COTS population
- Type II functional responses for predation
- Two coral functional groups (fast/slow growing)
- Outbreak amplification mechanism based on composite favorability
- Temperature, immigration, and food availability drivers

## Key Gap Identified

The current temperature response (Equation 2) uses a symmetric Gaussian function:
