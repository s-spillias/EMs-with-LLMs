MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Captures predator-prey dynamics between COTS and two coral functional groups
2. Includes Allee effects at low COTS density (important for outbreak thresholds)
3. Temperature-dependent recruitment provides environmental forcing
4. Type II functional responses with prey switching are ecologically realistic
5. Density-dependent mortality captures crowding effects

Weaknesses:
1. MISSING CRITICAL OUTBREAK TRIGGER: The model lacks nutrient-enhanced larval recruitment, which is the primary driver of episodic COTS outbreaks on the GBR
2. Immigration effect is linear and simplistic - doesn't capture threshold dynamics
3. Temperature effect is purely Gaussian - may miss asymmetric responses
4. Starvation effect in mortality is ad-hoc (Equation 10)

=== ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENT ===

Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks are strongly linked to nutrient pulses from:
- Terrestrial runoff (especially after wet seasons/floods)
- Upwelling events
- River plumes carrying elevated nitrogen and phosphorus

Mechanism:
- COTS larvae spend ~4 weeks in plankton
- Nutrient pulses → phytoplankton blooms → increased larval food
- Larval survival increases from <1% to 10-20% during nutrient events
- This creates recruitment pulses that initiate outbreaks

The current model has temperature and immigration effects, but these alone cannot explain the episodic, pulsed nature of outbreaks that characterize GBR COTS dynamics.

=== PROPOSED MODIFICATION (PENDING DATA AVAILABILITY) ===

When nutrient data becomes available, add nutrient-enhanced recruitment mechanism:

1. New data input: nutrient_dat (nutrient concentration proxy, e.g., chlorophyll-a, river discharge index)

2. New parameters:
   - log_nutrient_effect: Maximum enhancement of recruitment from nutrients
   - log_nutrient_halfsat: Half-saturation constant for nutrient response (Michaelis-Menten kinetics)

3. Mathematical form (Michaelis-Menten saturation):
   nutrient_enhancement = 1 + nutrient_effect * (nutrient / (nutrient_halfsat + nutrient))
   
   This provides:
   - Baseline recruitment when nutrients are low (enhancement = 1)
   - Saturating response at high nutrients (prevents unrealistic explosion)
   - Ecologically realistic threshold behavior
   - Smooth, differentiable function for optimization

4. Integration into COTS growth (Equation 11):
   Multiply the recruitment term by nutrient_enhancement
   This creates recruitment pulses during high-nutrient periods

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

1. Better capture of outbreak timing - pulses align with nutrient events
2. More realistic boom-bust cycles - outbreaks triggered by environmental conditions
3. Improved prediction of outbreak magnitude - nutrient intensity affects recruitment strength
4. Maintains model parsimony - only 2 new parameters with clear biological meaning

=== CURRENT STATUS ===

The nutrient enhancement feature has been removed from the model because nutrient data is not currently available in the dataset. The model will compile and run with the existing data structure. When nutrient data becomes available, the enhancement can be re-implemented following the plan outlined above.
