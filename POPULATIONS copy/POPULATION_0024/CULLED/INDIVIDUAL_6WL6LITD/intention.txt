MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model includes comprehensive COTS-coral predator-prey dynamics with:
- Allee effects for low-density COTS populations
- Temperature-dependent recruitment
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Prey switching between fast and slow corals
- Density-dependent mortality
- Temperature stress on corals

CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:
------------------------
The nutrient-mediated recruitment mechanism (Equation 3a) is currently INACTIVE, set to neutral effect (1.0). This is the primary ecological mechanism for triggering episodic COTS outbreaks following flood events, which is central to the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions."

The model already has well-parameterized nutrient response parameters from literature:
- nutrient_baseline = 0.8 (80% recruitment under oligotrophic conditions)
- nutrient_max = 5.0 (5-fold enhancement during phytoplankton blooms)
- nutrient_half = 0.3 (threshold at 30% of nutrient scale)
- hill_coef = 2.5 (steep sigmoidal response)

However, these parameters are unused because nutrient_dat is not available.

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:
-----------------------------------
ACTIVATE nutrient-mediated recruitment using a temperature-based seasonal proxy for nutrient availability.

Ecological Rationale:
1. COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef are strongly associated with flood plumes that deliver terrestrial nutrients during the wet season (December-March)
2. Flood events coincide with warm SST periods during the monsoon season
3. Warm temperatures (>27°C) combined with nutrient pulses create optimal conditions for larval survival
4. We can construct a biologically-realistic nutrient proxy using SST as a seasonal indicator

Mathematical Implementation:
- Create nutrient_proxy from SST using a sigmoidal function centered on warm-season temperatures
- nutrient_proxy = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * (SST - threshold)))
- Use threshold = 27°C (onset of warm season conducive to floods)
- Use steepness = 0.5 (gradual seasonal transition)
- This proxy ranges 0-1, representing seasonal nutrient availability
- Feed this proxy into the existing Hill function (Equation 3a)

Expected Outcomes:
1. Episodic recruitment pulses during warm periods (simulating flood-driven outbreaks)
2. Boom-bust dynamics as high recruitment leads to population explosions
3. Subsequent crashes when coral resources are depleted
4. Realistic timing of outbreaks aligned with environmental conditions

This improvement activates existing, well-justified parameters rather than adding new complexity, making it parsimonious while addressing the core PROJECT CONTEXT requirement for capturing outbreak episodicity.

PARAMETER UPDATES:
------------------
No new parameters added. The existing nutrient parameters are now active and functional.

The temperature-based proxy parameters (threshold=27°C, steepness=0.5) are hard-coded as they represent well-established GBR seasonal patterns and don't require estimation.
