MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model includes sophisticated outbreak dynamics with:
- Threshold-based recruitment (Hill function with cooperativity)
- Immigration weighting and Allee effects
- Resource-recruitment coupling
- Temperature effects on COTS and coral

IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
------------------
1. Temperature effect on COTS recruitment (Equation 2) uses a narrow Gaussian centered at 28.4°C
   - Updated literature value (log_temp_opt = 3.3495) has tight bounds (28-29°C)
   - May be too restrictive for capturing outbreak dynamics across observed temperature range
   - Current formulation: exp(-0.5 * (T - T_opt)^2 / width^2) drops off rapidly

2. Missing critical ecological process: LARVAL SURVIVAL
   - COTS outbreaks on GBR strongly linked to environmental conditions during larval phase
   - Nutrient pulses → phytoplankton blooms → larval food → higher survival
   - Current model jumps from adult reproduction directly to recruitment without larval stage
   - Immigration effectiveness should depend on local settlement conditions

3. Immigration treated as simple additive term
   - Doesn't account for settlement success varying with local conditions
   - Larvae arriving from upstream still need favorable conditions to settle and survive

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT SELECTED:
--------------------------------
Add LARVAL SURVIVAL AND SETTLEMENT SUCCESS mechanism that:

1. Separates larval production from successful recruitment
2. Models larval survival as function of environmental conditions
3. Makes immigration effectiveness conditional on settlement suitability
4. Uses temperature as proxy for seasonal productivity/conditions

MATHEMATICAL APPROACH:
---------------------
Replace narrow Gaussian temperature effect with broader larval survival window:
- Larval survival function: asymmetric response with optimal range
- Settlement success: combines temperature suitability with resource availability
- Immigration modulation: external larvae also need favorable local conditions to settle

NEW PARAMETERS:
--------------
- log_temp_larval_min: Lower temperature threshold for larval survival (~26°C)
- log_temp_larval_max: Upper temperature threshold for larval survival (~31°C)
- larval_survival_shape: Controls steepness of survival response at thresholds
- settlement_success_baseline: Minimum settlement rate under poor conditions
- immigration_settlement_coupling: How strongly immigration depends on local settlement conditions

EQUATIONS MODIFIED:
------------------
- Equation 2: Replace Gaussian with asymmetric larval survival function
- Equation 3: Modify to represent larval production (not direct recruitment)
- New equation: Larval survival probability based on temperature window
- New equation: Settlement success combining survival and resource availability
- Equation 4: Modify immigration to depend on settlement conditions
- Equation 7: Update effective recruitment to use settlement success

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
------------------------
COTS have a planktonic larval phase lasting 2-4 weeks where survival depends on:
- Food availability (phytoplankton) - correlated with temperature/season
- Temperature within viable range (too cold = slow development, too hot = stress)
- Settlement substrate availability (coral for newly settled juveniles)

This mechanism better captures:
- Why outbreaks are episodic (require favorable larval conditions)
- Why immigration alone doesn't always cause outbreaks (needs local settlement success)
- Why outbreaks have seasonal/environmental triggers
- The boom-bust dynamics (favorable conditions → mass recruitment → outbreak)

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
---------------------
- Better capture timing of outbreak initiation
- More realistic representation of recruitment variability
- Improved fit during outbreak onset and decline phases
- Mechanistic link between environment and population explosions
