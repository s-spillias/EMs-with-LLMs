ECOLOGICAL MODEL INTENTION: Crown-of-Thorns Starfish Outbreak Dynamics

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, capturing characteristic boom-bust cycles and their impacts on coral communities.

KEY ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (aggregation benefits for reproduction)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival (warmer temperatures enhance recruitment success)
   - External larval immigration events that can trigger outbreaks
   - Density-dependent mortality increasing at high population densities (resource limitation, disease)
   - Natural background mortality

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Two functional coral groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites)
   - Logistic growth with different intrinsic rates reflecting life history strategies
   - Differential predation pressure from COTS (Type II functional response)
   - Competition for space between coral groups
   - Temperature stress effects on coral growth and mortality

3. Predator-Prey Interactions:
   - COTS exhibit selective feeding with preferences for different coral types
   - Functional response captures satiation effects at high coral densities
   - Predation efficiency varies with COTS density (interference at high densities)
   - Coral availability influences COTS survival and reproduction

4. Outbreak Mechanisms:
   - Larval immigration pulses can initiate outbreaks when local populations are low
   - Positive feedback through Allee effects amplifies population growth during favorable conditions
   - High coral cover (especially fast-growing species) supports outbreak persistence
   - Temperature anomalies enhance recruitment success
   - Outbreaks collapse when coral resources are depleted or density-dependent mortality increases

5. Environmental Forcing:
   - Sea surface temperature affects both COTS recruitment and coral stress
   - Larval immigration represents connectivity from upstream reefs
   - Temperature variability creates windows of opportunity for outbreak initiation

The model captures the observed pattern where COTS populations remain low for extended periods, then rapidly increase to outbreak levels (>0.22 individuals/mÂ²) following favorable recruitment conditions, persist while coral resources are available, and crash when resources are depleted or environmental conditions become unfavorable.
