MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Captures basic boom-bust dynamics through logistic growth with Allee effects
2. Includes selective predation on two coral functional groups (fast/slow growing)
3. Temperature effects on recruitment provide environmental forcing
4. Immigration allows for metapopulation dynamics
5. Type II functional responses for predation are ecologically realistic

Weaknesses identified:
1. MISSING CRITICAL MECHANISM: No nutrient/food availability effects on larval survival
   - COTS outbreaks on GBR are strongly associated with nutrient pulses from river runoff
   - Enhanced phytoplankton availability is key to larval survival and recruitment success
   - This is arguably THE primary trigger mechanism for outbreak initiation
   - NOTE: This mechanism was prepared for implementation but requires nutrient data to be added

2. Temperature effect is overly simplistic:
   - Current Gaussian form assumes symmetric response around optimum
   - Biological evidence suggests asymmetric responses (sharper decline above optimal temp)
   - However, temp_opt parameter was recently updated from literature, so structure is adequate

3. Allee effect could be more mechanistic:
   - Current form is phenomenological threshold
   - Could represent fertilization success more explicitly
   - But current form is computationally stable and captures essential dynamics

=== CURRENT MODEL STATUS ===

The model has been reverted to the baseline version (without nutrient effects) to ensure compilation and execution with the current data availability. The nutrient enhancement mechanism has been documented and prepared for future implementation when nutrient forcing data becomes available.

Current model structure:
- COTS population dynamics with logistic growth
- Allee effect for outbreak threshold behavior
- Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response)
- Immigration for metapopulation connectivity
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Two coral functional groups with competition
- Dynamic COTS carrying capacity based on coral availability

=== FUTURE ENHANCEMENT (PREPARED) ===

ENHANCEMENT: Nutrient-mediated larval survival and recruitment

Ecological Justification:
- Primary COTS outbreaks on GBR correlate strongly with flood events and nutrient runoff
- Phytoplankton blooms provide critical food for COTS larvae during pelagic phase
- Larval survival is the bottleneck that determines recruitment success
- Nutrient availability interacts with temperature - both must be favorable for major recruitment

Mathematical Implementation (when data available):
1. Add nutrient forcing data vector (nutrient_dat) - proxy for phytoplankton/food availability
2. Implement Type II saturating response for nutrient effect on recruitment:
   - nutrient_effect = (nutrient_uptake * nutrient) / (nutrient_half_sat + nutrient)
   - Saturating form reflects biological realism: diminishing returns at high nutrient levels
   - Half-saturation constant represents nutrient level for 50% maximum effect
3. Multiply recruitment term by nutrient_effect (alongside existing temp and Allee effects)
4. This creates realistic outbreak triggers: requires alignment of nutrients + temperature + sufficient adult density

Parameters for Future Implementation:
- nutrient_uptake: Maximum recruitment enhancement from nutrients (dimensionless multiplier)
  * Represents maximum fold-increase in recruitment under optimal nutrient conditions
  * Literature suggests 2-5x enhancement is realistic for COTS larvae
  * Bounds: 1.0 (no effect) to 10.0 (very strong effect)

- nutrient_half_sat: Half-saturation constant for nutrient effect (nutrient units)
  * Nutrient concentration at which recruitment enhancement is 50% of maximum
  * Will depend on units of nutrient data (e.g., chlorophyll-a, nitrogen concentration)
  * Bounds: 0.1 to 100.0 to allow flexibility for different nutrient metrics

- nutrient_dat: Nutrient/phytoplankton forcing time series (DATA_VECTOR)
  * Could be chlorophyll-a concentration, nitrogen load, or other food availability proxy
  * Units will depend on data source
  * Bounds: 0.0 to reasonable maximum for the metric used

Expected Improvements (when implemented):
1. Better capture outbreak initiation timing (aligned with nutrient pulses)
2. More realistic magnitude of recruitment events (nutrient-driven)
3. Improved prediction of outbreak locations (areas receiving runoff)
4. Mechanistic link to climate/land-use drivers (rainfall, agriculture)

This enhancement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events" by incorporating the primary environmental driver of COTS recruitment on the Great Barrier Reef.
