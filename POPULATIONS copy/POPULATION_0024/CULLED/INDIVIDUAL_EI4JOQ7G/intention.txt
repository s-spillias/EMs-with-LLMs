MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Implements Allee effects for low-density recruitment limitation
- Temperature-dependent recruitment with Gaussian response
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Prey preference and switching behavior between coral types
- Density-dependent mortality and starvation effects
- Immigration enhancement of local populations

Weaknesses Identified:
1. OUTBREAK TRIGGERING MECHANISM: The current model lacks a key ecological driver of COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef - nutrient-mediated larval recruitment. Literature strongly supports that flood events delivering terrestrial nutrients enhance phytoplankton production, which dramatically increases COTS larval survival and recruitment success.

2. EPISODIC DYNAMICS: While the model has immigration effects, it doesn't capture the threshold-like response to environmental conditions that creates the characteristic "boom" phase of outbreaks. Nutrient pulses create non-linear recruitment responses.

3. PARAMETER UPDATES: Several parameters have been updated from literature (log_mort_base, log_temp_opt, log_temp_stress_threshold) with tight bounds, indicating these are well-constrained. The recruitment equation should be enhanced to better utilize these refined parameters.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Enhancement: Nutrient-Enhanced Larval Recruitment with Threshold Response

Ecological Justification:
- COTS larvae are planktotrophic, feeding on phytoplankton during their ~2-3 week larval period
- Flood events from Queensland rivers deliver nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) to GBR waters
- Nutrient enrichment → phytoplankton blooms → increased larval survival (can increase by 10-100x)
- This creates episodic recruitment pulses that trigger outbreak events
- Explains the spatial pattern of outbreaks (more common in northern/central GBR near river inputs)
- Explains temporal clustering of outbreaks following wet seasons

Mathematical Implementation:
Add a sigmoidal (Hill function) response to capture threshold effects:
- nutrient_effect = nutrient_baseline + (nutrient_max - nutrient_baseline) * (nutrient^hill_coef) / (nutrient_half^hill_coef + nutrient^hill_coef)
- This creates a non-linear response where moderate nutrient levels dramatically boost recruitment
- Multiplies with existing temperature and Allee effects in recruitment term

New Parameters:
1. nutrient_baseline: Baseline recruitment multiplier under low-nutrient conditions (0.5-1.0)
2. nutrient_max: Maximum recruitment enhancement under high nutrients (2.0-10.0)
3. nutrient_half: Half-saturation constant for nutrient effect (dimensionless, 0.1-1.0)
4. hill_coef: Hill coefficient controlling threshold steepness (1.0-4.0, higher = sharper threshold)

Implementation Status:
- Parameters have been added to parameters.json with ecologically justified bounds
- Model structure (model.cpp) has been prepared with the nutrient effect framework
- Currently set to neutral effect (nutrient_effect = 1.0) until nutrient_dat becomes available
- The code is ready to activate the full Hill function when nutrient data is provided
- This allows the model to compile and run with existing datasets while being prepared for future enhancement

Note: Nutrient data vector (nutrient_dat) will need to be derived from:
- River discharge data
- Chlorophyll-a satellite observations
- Modeled nutrient concentrations
- Rainfall/runoff indices

Once nutrient_dat is available, simply uncomment the Hill function code in model.cpp (Equation 3a) to activate the full nutrient-mediated recruitment mechanism.

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

When nutrient data becomes available and the mechanism is activated, this enhancement should:
1. Better capture outbreak initiation timing (linked to flood/nutrient events)
2. Increase outbreak magnitude through enhanced recruitment pulses
3. Maintain boom-bust dynamics (nutrient effects are episodic, not sustained)
4. Improve model fit during outbreak onset periods
5. Provide mechanistic link between terrestrial processes and marine outbreaks

This directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" and "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events."

Current Status: Framework implemented, awaiting nutrient data for full activation.
