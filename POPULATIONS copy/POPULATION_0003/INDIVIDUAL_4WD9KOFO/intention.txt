Assessment of current model and fit:
- Data fit: A residuals file was referenced but not provided here, so I cannot quantify fit. Conceptually, this model is capable of reproducing smooth boom-bust patterns via (i) positive feedback in reproduction (fertilization success), (ii) temperature-modified recruitment, (iii) food-modified survival, and (iv) Beverton–Holt crowding. However, outbreaks in Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) are often sharper in onset and exhibit threshold behavior that can be difficult to capture with a simple saturating (Hill exponent = 1) fertilization function. In practice, this can lead to phase errors (mistimed peaks), underestimation of peak magnitude, and overly gradual buildup/decline.

- Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT: The model captures key pathways: selective predation on coral guilds, temperature-modified performance (larvae and corals), immigration, and food-limited adult survival. These mechanisms are relevant to the timing and magnitude of outbreaks. However, a critical feature of broadcast spawning is superlinear fertilization success at low densities due to gamete dilution and turbulent mixing. Using a simple saturating function with exponent 1 can underrepresent the Allee effect strength that helps create outbreak thresholds and rapid transitions.

- Potentially missing or oversimplified processes:
  1) Mate-finding/fertilization nonlinearity: Current phi_spawn = C / (h_spawn + C) assumes a Hill exponent of 1. Empirical and theoretical work on broadcast spawners supports stronger-than-linear density dependence (Hill exponent > 1), which creates threshold behavior crucial for episodic outbreaks.
  2) Stage structure/delayed recruitment: Adults are modeled in a single compartment; juvenile staging could add realistic time lags. This is a larger structural change and not introduced here to keep changes minimal and focused.
  3) External drivers of recruitment pulses (e.g., nutrient/runoff-driven larval food leading to survival spikes) and environmental stochasticity are not explicitly represented.
  4) Predation on COTS (top-down control) and disturbance-driven coral dynamics (e.g., cyclones, bleaching) are simplified or absent.

Parameter review:
- Topt_cots is flagged as updated_from_literature with tight bounds (28–29 °C), which is consistent with a narrow thermal optimum for larval survival. The Gaussian temperature response remains appropriate.
- log_q_FR = -0.693 implies q = 1.5 (Type III-like) predation selectivity, giving flexible curvature for coral consumption; current structure is appropriate.
- Other parameters are initial estimates with plausible bounds.

Chosen improvement (one change):
- Introduce a superlinear fertilization success via a Hill exponent nu_spawn ≥ 1:
  phi_spawn = C^nu_spawn / (h_spawn^nu_spawn + C^nu_spawn)
  This strengthens the Allee effect at low C, promoting threshold dynamics that better reproduce rapid outbreak onset and subsequent busts once densities fall below the threshold. It is a targeted, minimal structural change aligning with known fertilization ecology of broadcast spawners and the PROJECT CONTEXT’s focus on episodic outbreaks.
- Implementation details:
  - Add a new parameter log_nu_spawn with transform nu_spawn = 1 + exp(log_nu_spawn), ensuring nu_spawn ≥ 1.
  - Penalize nu_spawn softly to stay within a biologically plausible range [1, 5].
  - Keep fec free to rescale overall recruitment given the steeper fertilization curve.
- Data leakage safeguards: The prediction equations continue to use only previous time step predicted states; observed values are used only at initialization (t=0) and within the likelihood, preserving causality.

Expected effect:
- Sharper, threshold-like recruitment response should improve the timing and magnitude of modeled outbreaks without overcomplicating the state structure.
- If residuals previously showed lag in outbreak onset or muted peaks, this change should reduce those issues.
