Yes. To better capture episodic outbreak dynamics consistent with the project context, I propose adding an Acropora-mediated juvenile transition filter to the COTS recruitment term. This introduces a positive feedback that  
can generate boom-bust cycles: when fast coral (Acropora) is abundant, more juveniles successfully transition to adults, facilitating outbreaks; as COTS deplete Acropora, future recruitment to adults drops, enabling busts   
and recovery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

 2 Explanation of changes                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 • Assessment summary (limits): No residuals file was provided, so I cannot quantitatively evaluate fit. Conceptually, the current model includes many realistic mechanisms (temperature-dependent performance, fertilization   
   Allee effect, food-limited adult survival, selective predation, density-dependence), but it lacks a key indirect pathway: dependence of juvenile-to-adult transition on Acropora availability. This mechanism is             
   well-supported ecologically and is important for generating pulses/outbreaks with realistic timing and magnitude.                                                                                                            
 • Model change: Multiply the recruits term by a new saturating function of fast coral cover: phi_juv(A) = A / (k_juv + A). This modulates the fraction of locally produced recruits that survive to adulthood based on         
   available preferred prey habitat (Acropora), creating the desired positive feedback and a natural threshold behavior. It uses predicted state A_t (not observed data), avoiding data leakage.                                
 • Parameters: Add k_juv (half-saturation % cover, suggested bounds 0.1–50%). This mirrors existing saturation parameters (hA/hS/foodK) and is identifiable given coral and COTS observations.                                  
 • Code: Add k_juv parameter and penalty; compute phi_juv from fast_pred(t); include phi_juv factor in recruits.

 +  1) Missing indirect pathway: juvenile-to-adult transition likely depends on Acropora availability. High Acropora promotes successful transition to coral-feeding stages; when Acropora is depleted by outbreaks, subsequent 
 transition is suppressed. This feedback helps produce boom-bust dynamics.                                                                                                                                                      
 +  2) No explicit juvenile stage or delay; current recruitment is immediate to adults after one year, driven by adult density and SST only.

 +- Increases outbreak likelihood when Acropora is high, amplifying peaks without permanently destabilizing dynamics (as crowding and food feedback still operate).                                                             
 +- Tightens coupling between coral composition and COTS boom-bust cycles, likely improving residuals around outbreak onset/peak if current model underpredicts those phases.
