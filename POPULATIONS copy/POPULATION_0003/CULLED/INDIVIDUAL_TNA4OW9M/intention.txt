ASSESSMENT

1) Fit to data (provisional: residuals file not provided here)
- Without access to residuals, a quantitative assessment is not possible. Structurally, the model is likely to produce relatively smooth adult COTS trajectories due to Beverton–Holt (BH) density dependence at the adult stage, which can under-represent sharp outbreak peaks and rapid post-peak collapses observed on the GBR.
- If residuals show positive spikes at peaks (under-predicted maxima) and negative residuals during declines (over-predicted persistence), that pattern would be consistent with BH being too compensatory.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths:
  - Selective predation on fast (Acropora) vs slow corals is included via separate functional responses.
  - Thermal modulation of recruitment and a smooth bleaching effect on corals are present.
  - Coral logistic growth with crowding by total cover is represented.
  - An Allee effect on reproduction and immigration are included.
- Gaps/risks for outbreak realism:
  - Adult crowding is currently Beverton–Holt, which tends to damp oscillations and can prolong outbreaks unrealistically.
  - No explicit environmental driver for larval survival surges (e.g., nutrient pulses/flood plumes), a known trigger for major COTS recruitment pulses.
  - Adult mortality is not temperature-modulated; heatwaves may elevate mortality.
  - Stage structure is simplified to a single-year juvenile-to-adult transition, which may miss multi-year cohort waves.

3) Potentially missing/oversimplified ecological processes
- Overcompensatory density dependence at high adult densities (e.g., space limitation, culling intensity, disease).
- Episodic environmental drivers of larval survival (nutrient pulses).
- Temperature effects on adult mortality.
- Multi-year stage structure/lagged dynamics.
- Predator/biocontrol feedbacks on early life stages.

PARAMETER REVIEW

- Most parameters appear as initial estimates with plausible bounds; no entries are flagged as updated_from_literature = true.
- bC (“Beverton–Holt crowding coefficient”) is central for outbreak amplitude/duration. In BH form, bC moderates growth but rarely creates sharp busts. Under a Ricker form, the same magnitude of bC produces stronger overcompensation at high densities.
- Given the model change below, bC is reinterpreted as a Ricker crowding coefficient (units unchanged); the numerical value may need re-tuning after refit, but current bounds [0, 5] remain appropriate.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT

Approach: Introduce overcompensatory adult density dependence (Ricker) to better capture boom–bust cycles.

Ecological justification:
- At high adult COTS densities, increased intraspecific interference, resource limitation (e.g., coral depletion, movement costs), and management removal can cause per-capita survival to drop sharply. Overcompensation is a plausible mechanism for the rapid declines following outbreak peaks.
- This change directly addresses outbreak timing, peak magnitude, and rapid collapse without needing new data streams or parameters.

Mathematical change (annual, using only previous states):
- Before (BH): C_{t+1} = Num_t_pos / (1 + bC * Num_t_pos)
- After (Ricker): C_{t+1} = Num_t_pos * exp(-bC * Num_t_pos)
  where Num_t = (1 - mC0) * C_t + sJ * R_t and Num_t_pos = softplus(Num_t)

Implementation details:
- Reused bC with same units (1/(ind/m^2)).
- Updated comments and parameter description to reflect Ricker.
- No additional parameters introduced; preserves positivity and avoids data leakage.

Expected impacts on residuals and dynamics:
- Higher, sharper peaks in adult density when recruitment is strong.
- Faster declines post-peak due to overcompensatory mortality, shortening outbreak duration.
- Potential improvement where prior model under-predicted peaks and over-predicted persistence.

Next steps (optional, if residuals suggest):
- If peaks are still under-predicted, consider episodic environmental pulses (nutrients) modulating recruitment.
- If collapses are too sharp, lower bC or introduce a shape parameter (Num^theta) to tune overcompensation.
- Consider temperature-modulated adult mortality during extreme SST events.
