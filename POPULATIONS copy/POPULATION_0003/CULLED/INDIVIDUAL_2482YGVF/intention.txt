Assessment of current model and rationale for improvement

1) Fit to data
- Residuals file was not provided, so a formal residual-based assessment is pending.
- Based on the current structure (instantaneous recruitment to adults, single adult survival channel), typical issues in similar systems include:
  - Under-prediction of outbreak peaks (peaks too smooth/low).
  - Timing lags (adult peaks shifted relative to observations).
  - Overly gradual declines post-peak (insufficient bust dynamics).

2) Alignment with project context
- The project focuses on episodic outbreaks (boom–bust) driven by strong, temporally concentrated recruitment pulses and environmentally sensitive early survival.
- The current model includes an Allee-effect in fertilization, temperature-modified reproduction, food-limited adult survival, and Beverton–Holt crowding. These are useful but tend to smooth population dynamics because new recruits enter the adult class immediately, which limits the ability to generate sharp pulses and cohort-driven oscillations.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Stage structure: A single adult stage misses the critical juvenile/subadult pipeline that creates delays and cohort resonance.
- Early-stage environmental sensitivity: Larval/juvenile survival is often more sensitive to environmental conditions than adult survival; currently only recruitment is temperature-modified and survival depends on coral food for adults.
- Disturbances and nutrient pulses: Not represented here; nutrient-driven larval survival pulses are often important. Given available inputs, we defer adding new exogenous drivers.

Chosen ecological improvement: add a juvenile/subadult stage with maturation delay

Rationale
- Ecological realism: COTS have multi-stage life cycles with high early mortality and a maturation delay before adulthood. Outbreaks are frequently driven by pulses in early-stage survival, not immediate conversion to adults.
- Dynamical benefit: Introducing a juvenile pool (J) with survival and maturation fraction (gJ) provides:
  - A one-year delay that can synchronize cohorts and amplify peaks.
  - Stronger environmental gating on early survival (via temperature and food), creating bursty recruitment to adulthood and more realistic boom–bust behavior.
- Parsimony: Only two new parameters are added (gJ, mJ). We reuse existing food-limitation (foodK, mC_food) to limit complexity.

Summary of structural changes
- Reproduction and immigration feed juveniles, not adults:
  L_t = fec * C_t * phi_spawn_t * phi_T_COTS_t + alpha_imm * cotsimm_t / (k_imm + cotsimm_t)
- Juvenile update with survival and maturation:
  survivalJ_t = exp(-(mJ + mC_food * (1 - phi_food_t))) * phi_T_COTS_t
  M_t = gJ * J_t * survivalJ_t
  J_{t+1} = (1 - gJ) * J_t * survivalJ_t + L_t
- Adult update:
  C_{t+1} = BH( C_t * exp(-(mC + mC_food * (1 - phi_food_t))) + M_t )
- Coral and predation submodels unchanged.

Parameter notes and suggested bounds
- gJ (new): annual maturation fraction (0–1). Lower_bound=0.0, upper_bound=1.0.
- mJ (new): baseline juvenile mortality (yr^-1). Lower_bound=0.0, upper_bound=5.0.
- fec (updated meaning): now recruits to juvenile pool (not directly to adults).

Next steps for evaluation (once residuals are available)
- Check peak underprediction and lag in adult residuals; diagnose if gJ and mJ allow peak sharpness and correct timing.
- Inspect juv_pred trajectories to confirm cohort pulses.
- Sensitivity of outbreaks to foodK and mC_food now affects early survival; adjust if early-stage sensitivity is too weak/strong.
