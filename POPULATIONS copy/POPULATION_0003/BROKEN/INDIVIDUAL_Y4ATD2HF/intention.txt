Assessment and rationale

Data fit
- No residuals file was provided here, so I could not compute diagnostics. Conceptually, models that move recruits to the adult class after only one year often predict outbreaks that rise too quickly and peak too early relative to observations.

Project context alignment
- Strengths: The model already captures selective predation on coral (higher removal from Acropora), logistic coral growth with total-cover crowding, temperature-modulated bleaching, immigration forcing, and Beverton–Holt crowding for adult COTS.
- Limitation: Outbreak timing and duration are controlled largely by the maturation time from recruits to survey-detectable adults. A one-year juvenile duration is typically too short; COTS reach detectable adult sizes over ~2 years (often 2–3). Without this delay, the model under-represents delayed density dependence that sustains boom–bust cycles.

Potentially oversimplified or missing processes
- Stage structure/juvenile maturation delay (key for outbreak timing).
- Environmental modifiers beyond temperature for early life (e.g., nutrients/food) could further influence recruitment, but this adds complexity.
- Predator control and cannibalism are not modeled; those could add further regulation.
- Prey preference is present (aF > aS) but is static; dynamic switching is possible but unnecessary for one targeted improvement.

Chosen single ecological improvement

Introduce a two-stage juvenile maturation pipeline (delay to adulthood)
Motivation:
- Provides delayed density dependence critical for timing and magnitude of outbreaks while keeping parameter count minimal.
- Aligns with empirical maturation times (juveniles take ~2 years to reach adult survey class).

Mathematical changes:
- Let R_t be recruits produced during [t-1, t) as in the current model.
- Add juvenile stages J1 and J2 (ind/m²), both non-negative states.
  J1_{t} receives new recruits from the prior interval:
    J1_{t} = R_t
  J2_{t} receives survivors from J1 in the previous year:
    J2_{t} = sJ * J1_{t-1}
  Adults receive survivors from J2 in the previous year:
    Adults_added_t = sJ * J2_{t-1}
- Adult update becomes:
    Num_t = (1 - mC0) * C_{t-1} + Adults_added_t
    C_{t} = softplus(Num_t) / (1 + bC * softplus(Num_t))
- Recruits R_t are still driven by food (consumed coral), temperature (thermal), Allee effect, and immigration as before.
- No data leakage: only previous time-step states are used in updates.

Parameter updates:
- sJ semantics are updated to “annual juvenile survival per stage in a two-year maturation pipeline.” Value and bounds unchanged.

Expected effects on fit and dynamics:
- Outbreak peaks delayed by ~1 extra year, with more realistic rise and fall.
- Greater persistence/width of outbreak peaks due to delayed feedback, better matching boom–bust cycles.

Implementation notes:
- Initialize J1 and J2 at zero; early years may have small transients that are absorbed during estimation.
- No new parameters introduced for identifiability and parsimony.
