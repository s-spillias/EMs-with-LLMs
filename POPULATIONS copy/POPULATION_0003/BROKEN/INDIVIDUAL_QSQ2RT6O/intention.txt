Assessment (pending residuals file)
- Model-data fit: Direct evaluation is pending because the residuals file was not provided. Please share residuals (or a brief summary) for adult COTS, fast coral, and slow coral so we can confirm patterns (e.g., peak timing biases, amplitude under/over-shoots, duration mismatches).
- Ecological scope: The model already captures key processes—selective predation on two coral groups, food-fueled recruitment, an Allee effect on reproduction, temperature-modified recruitment performance, bleaching impacts on coral, and adult density dependence (Beverton–Holt).
- Likely gaps vs. PROJECT CONTEXT: A critical mechanism for episodic boom–bust cycles is the multi-year cryptic juvenile phase of COTS, which creates a delay between larval production events and the emergence of high adult densities. The original model routed recruitment directly into the next year’s adult class, which can make outbreak timing too synchronous with recruitment pulses and shorten outbreak duration.

Parameter review
- T_opt has been updated with narrow bounds (28–29 °C) and a literature-supported value (28.5 °C). This does not require structural change; the Gaussian thermal performance remains appropriate.
- Other parameters appear as initial or literature-based estimates with plausible bounds. No inconsistencies detected that would force a change in scaling elsewhere.
- The parameter sJ previously represented survival to next-year adults; it is ecologically more accurate as early survival/settlement into a cryptic juvenile class. This reinterpretation better matches COTS life history.

Chosen improvement: Add a cryptic juvenile stage with maturation delay
Rationale
- COTS typically spend ~2–3+ years as cryptic juveniles before switching to coral feeding and contributing to outbreaks. This delay is central to generating realistic boom–bust timing and persistence and reduces the need for extreme parameter values to reproduce outbreak lags.
- Implementing a single juvenile state is a minimal-complexity extension that provides the key temporal separation: larvae → juveniles (cryptic) → adults. It maintains stability and avoids data leakage.

Mathematical changes
- New state J_t (ind/m²) = cryptic juveniles.
- Recruitment (unchanged form): R_t = thermal × epsilon_repro × (predF_t + predS_t) × Allee + alpha_imm × IMM_t.
- Juveniles: J_{t+1} = softplus(J_t + sJ × R_t − mJ × J_t − gJ × J_t).
  • sJ reinterpreted as early survival/settlement into the juvenile pool.
  • mJ is juvenile mortality; gJ is maturation to adults. A soft penalty encourages mJ + gJ ≤ 1.
- Adults (Beverton–Holt crowding retained): C_{t+1} uses post-mortality adults plus matured juveniles:
  • Num_t = (1 − mC0) × C_t + gJ × J_t
  • C_{t+1} = BH(softplus(Num_t))
- Coral and observation submodels are unchanged.

Expected effects on dynamics (to be verified with residuals)
- Timing: Peaks in adults are delayed relative to recruitment pulses, improving synchronization with observed outbreaks.
- Magnitude/duration: Maturation inflow gJ × J_t sustains adult densities for longer, better matching observed outbreak plateaus and gradual declines.
- Ecological realism: Represents the cryptic juvenile phase without overcomplicating age structure.

New/modified parameters and suggested bounds
- mJ (yr⁻¹): juvenile mortality fraction; bounds [0, 1].
- gJ (yr⁻¹): juvenile maturation fraction; bounds [0, 1]; typical prior mean ~0.3–0.5 (2–3 yr mean duration).
- J0 (ind/m²): initial juvenile density; bounds [0, 5].
- sJ: reinterpreted description (now early survival/settlement into juvenile class), bounds unchanged [0, 1].

Notes and next steps
- Please provide the residuals (or a brief summary). If adult peaks are still mistimed after this change, we can consider:
  • a 2-stage juvenile chain (gamma-distributed delay),
  • adding runoff/nutrient pulses as a recruitment multiplier (if data available),
  • or a weak refuge effect at low coral cover that tempers predation during busts.
- All transitions use previous states only; no data leakage is introduced. Positivity is enforced via softplus; adult density remains bounded via Beverton–Holt.
