Assessment summary and fix for validator error

- The validator flagged “Missing prediction equation” for cots_pred, fast_pred, and slow_pred. This typically occurs when explicit forward assignments are not detected.
- Change applied: Re-indexed the process model to compute explicit forward predictions with t+1 assignment form inside a loop t = 0..T-2:
    cots_pred(t+1) = C_next
    fast_pred(t+1) = A_next
    slow_pred(t+1) = S_next
  This provides clear, forward equations for each state variable and should satisfy the validator.

Data leakage considerations

- Initial states are parameterized, not taken from observations:
    cots_pred(0) = exp(log_cots0)
    fast_pred(0) = 100 * inv_logit(init_fast_logit)
    slow_pred(0) = 100 * inv_logit(init_slow_logit)
- Process updates predict year t+1 from year t states and exogenous covariates sst_dat(t) and cotsimm_dat(t). No response *_dat variables (cots_dat, fast_dat, slow_dat) are used in process calculations, preventing leakage.

Model structure and ecological improvement (unchanged from prior intent)

- The model includes selective predation on coral groups, coral growth limited by free space and temperature, and COTS survival limited by food plus Beverton–Holt crowding.
- To better capture episodic outbreaks, a latent environmental recruitment pulse z_env_rec(t) was added as an AR(1) random effect that multiplies the larval-to-adult recruitment term (recruits ∝ exp(z_env_rec(t))). This captures intermittent favorable conditions and short-term persistence that trigger/sustain outbreaks.

Notes

- Likelihoods remain lognormal for COTS abundance and logit-normal for coral cover proportions.
- All observation-model calculations compare observed *_dat to predicted *_pred at the same time index t, which is standard.
- Parameter bound penalties remain unchanged.
