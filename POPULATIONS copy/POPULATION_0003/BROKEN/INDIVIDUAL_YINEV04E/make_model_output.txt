I have a few clarifying questions before finalizing, but I can proceed with a concrete improvement now:                                                                                                                         

 • I don’t see a residuals file in the provided files. If you have it, please add it so I can quantify fit issues. For now, I’m proceeding based on commonly observed shortcomings in outbreak models.                          

Assessment summary:                                                                                                                                                                                                             

 1 Fit to data: Without residuals, I can’t quantify fit. However, this structure often struggles with the “bust” phase, because adult COTS mortality is constant and does not accelerate when prey becomes scarce. This tends to
   over-persist adult densities after peak consumption.                                                                                                                                                                         
 2 Alignment with project context: The model includes key triggers and feedbacks (thermal recruitment performance, Allee effect, coral-selective predation, Beverton–Holt crowding, bleaching). It captures boom via food-fueled
   recruitment, but the rapid post-outbreak crash can be muted due to constant adult mortality.                                                                                                                                 
 3 Likely missing/oversimplified processes:                                                                                                                                                                                     
    • Food-dependent adult mortality (starvation/migration) during low coral cover periods.                                                                                                                                     
    • Time-to-maturity (juvenile delay) is simplified as one-year recruitment-to-adult transition; a multi-year stage structure could improve timing but adds complexity.                                                       
    • Settlement limitation not explicitly linked to substrate/cover beyond consumption.                                                                                                                                        
    • Immigration pulses are included but not environmentally modulated beyond alpha_imm.                                                                                                                                       

Chosen improvement (one meaningful ecological change):                                                                                                                                                                          

 • Add food-dependent adult mortality that increases as coral cover declines. This mechanism steepens and shortens the outbreak peak (bust dynamics) without requiring new state variables.                                     
 • Mathematical form:                                                                                                                                                                                                           
   mC_t = mC0 + mC_starve * (1 - ((F_t + S_t)/(K_coral + eps))_clamped)                                                                                                                                                         
   Num = (1 - mC_t) * C_t + sJ * R_t                                                                                                                                                                                            
   where mC_starve ≥ 0 is a new parameter (yr^-1). We clamp mC_t to [0, 0.99] for numerical stability and clamp the cover fraction to [0, 1]. This keeps mortality biologically interpretable and avoids negative survival.     
 • Justification: Adult COTS experience starvation/movement losses as coral prey becomes scarce after peak predation. This is a well-documented driver of outbreak collapses and helps reproduce rapid post-peak crashes        
   required by the project goals.

 +- Based on experience with similar models, a common misfit occurs in the “bust” phase: adult COTS densities often decline too slowly after peaks because adult mortality is modeled as a constant fraction regardless of prey 
 depletion.

 +2) Alignment with project context                                                                                                                                                                                             
 +- The current model captures several essential mechanisms for episodic outbreaks: temperature-dependent recruitment performance, Allee effects, selective predation (aF > aS; hF < hS), bleaching impacts on coral, and bound 
 adult dynamics (Beverton–Holt).                                                                                                                                                                                                
 +- However, rapid post-outbreak collapses (boom–bust) can require an additional feedback: higher adult mortality when coral prey is scarce (starvation/migration). This feedback is important for accurately capturing the     
 timing and duration of outbreaks emphasized by the project.

 +3) Missing/oversimplified processes                                                                                                                                                                                           
 +- Food-dependent adult mortality: currently absent; likely critical to reproduce sharp busts following prey depletion.                                                                                                        
 +- Juvenile delay: recruits immediately feed into adults after one year; a more realistic multi-year maturation could improve timing but adds complexity and state dimension.                                                  
 +- Settlement limitation via substrate/cover beyond consumption: not explicitly modeled, though the chosen change below already enhances feedbacks through prey availability.                                                  
 +                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 +Chosen improvement: Food-dependent adult mortality                                                                                                                                                                            
 +- Rationale: Empirical and theoretical work indicates that adult COTS experience increased mortality (starvation, movement off-reef, predation susceptibility) as prey (coral) becomes scarce after an outbreak. Adding this  
 a smooth modifier helps match the observed rapid declines following peaks without introducing new state variables or data requirements.                                                                                        
 +- Mathematical form:                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 +  Let total_cover_t = F_t + S_t and define the normalized prey availability as food_mod_t = clamp(total_cover_t / K_coral, 0, 1).                                                                                             
 +  Then set the adult mortality for year t as:                                                                                                                                                                                 
 +    mC_t = clamp(mC0 + mC_starve * (1 - food_mod_t), 0, 0.99)                                                                                                                                                                 
 +  and the adult update:

 +  This increases mortality linearly as prey availability falls, with a cap for stability.

 +  - Introduced parameter mC_starve (yr^-1). Bounds: [0, 1] to maintain interpretability and prevent survival from becoming negative.                                                                                          
 +  - Clamped food_mod_t to [0, 1] and mC_t to [0, 0.99] for numerical stability.

 +- T_opt has been updated from literature (28.5 °C, [28.0, 29.0]); the Gaussian thermal performance remains appropriate under these values; no structural change required.                                                     
 +- Many parameters remain initial estimates (e.g., aF, aS, epsilon_repro, bC, k_allee). The new food-dependent mortality can reduce the need for unrealistically high bC to force crashes.                                     
 +- If residuals later show prolonged or premature peaks, consider adding an exponent on (1 - food_mod_t) to shape the response or adding a juvenile stage with explicit delay; these are deferred to keep the model            
 parsimonious.

Thanks for the error details.                                                                                                                                                                                                   

 1 Do any code changes appear needed?                                                                                                                                                                                           

 • No. The error shows the run failed before reaching model.cpp compilation. It’s caused by a missing R script: "Code/validate_model.R: No such file or directory".                                                             

 2 Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

 • The traceback indicates the failure occurs when the R workflow tries to source validate_model.R. That prevents the process from ever invoking TMB to compile model.cpp. There’s no indication of a C++ compile error from    
   model.cpp in the log you provided.                                                                                                                                                                                           

If you rerun after resolving the missing R script and you then see a C++ compiler error related to model.cpp, please share that specific compiler output and I’ll adjust the code accordingly.

Thanks for the log.                                                                                                                                                                                                             

 1 Are code changes needed?                                                                                                                                                                                                     

 • No. The process is failing before model.cpp is even compiled.                                                                                                                                                                

 2 Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

 • The error clearly indicates an R-side failure: Code/validate_model.R is missing. Because the R process halts at source("Code/validate_model.R"), TMB never gets to compile model.cpp. There is no C++ compiler output        
   pointing to an issue in model.cpp.                                                                                                                                                                                           

If you later encounter a compiler error that specifically references model.cpp (with C++ compiler diagnostics), please share that output and I’ll make the necessary code changes.
