Assessment and reasoning

1) Fit evaluation
- A residuals file was referenced but not available in the provided files. Without it, I cannot quantify goodness of fit or diagnose temporal/scale-specific issues with certainty.
- Based on experience with similar models, a common misfit occurs in the “bust” phase: adult COTS densities often decline too slowly after peaks because adult mortality is modeled as a constant fraction regardless of prey depletion.

2) Alignment with project context
- The current model captures several essential mechanisms for episodic outbreaks: temperature-dependent recruitment performance, Allee effects, selective predation (aF > aS; hF < hS), bleaching impacts on coral, and bounded adult dynamics (Beverton–Holt).
- However, rapid post-outbreak collapses (boom–bust) can require an additional feedback: higher adult mortality when coral prey is scarce (starvation/migration). This feedback is important for accurately capturing the timing and duration of outbreaks emphasized by the project.

3) Missing/oversimplified processes
- Food-dependent adult mortality: currently absent; likely critical to reproduce sharp busts following prey depletion.
- Juvenile delay: recruits immediately feed into adults after one year; a more realistic multi-year maturation could improve timing but adds complexity and state dimension.
- Settlement limitation via substrate/cover beyond consumption: not explicitly modeled, though the chosen change below already enhances feedbacks through prey availability.

Chosen improvement: Food-dependent adult mortality
- Rationale: Empirical and theoretical work indicates that adult COTS experience increased mortality (starvation, movement off-reef, predation susceptibility) as prey (coral) becomes scarce after an outbreak. Adding this as a smooth modifier helps match the observed rapid declines following peaks without introducing new state variables or data requirements.
- Mathematical form:
  Let total_cover_t = F_t + S_t and define the normalized prey availability as food_mod_t = clamp(total_cover_t / K_coral, 0, 1).
  Then set the adult mortality for year t as:
    mC_t = clamp(mC0 + mC_starve * (1 - food_mod_t), 0, 0.99)
  and the adult update:
    Num_t = (1 - mC_t) * C_t + sJ * R_t
  This increases mortality linearly as prey availability falls, with a cap for stability.
- Implementation details:
  - Introduced parameter mC_starve (yr^-1). Bounds: [0, 1] to maintain interpretability and prevent survival from becoming negative.
  - Clamped food_mod_t to [0, 1] and mC_t to [0, 0.99] for numerical stability.
  - No use of current-step observations in process equations (uses previous-step states only).

Parameter review notes
- T_opt has been updated from literature (28.5 °C, [28.0, 29.0]); the Gaussian thermal performance remains appropriate under these values; no structural change required.
- Many parameters remain initial estimates (e.g., aF, aS, epsilon_repro, bC, k_allee). The new food-dependent mortality can reduce the need for unrealistically high bC to force crashes.
- If residuals later show prolonged or premature peaks, consider adding an exponent on (1 - food_mod_t) to shape the response or adding a juvenile stage with explicit delay; these are deferred to keep the model parsimonious.

Requested data
- Please provide the residuals file to refine diagnostics (e.g., outbreak timing bias, peak magnitude, and decay rate).
