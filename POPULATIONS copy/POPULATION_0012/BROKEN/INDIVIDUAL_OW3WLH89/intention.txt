MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but lacks the critical mechanism for episodic outbreak initiation. Analysis reveals:

1. STRUCTURAL GAPS:
   - No explicit larval stage despite COTS having 2-4 week planktonic larvae
   - Missing nutrient-pulse mechanism that triggers real GBR outbreaks
   - Temperature effect alone insufficient to explain episodic (not continuous) outbreaks
   - Immigration treated as direct adult input rather than larval connectivity

2. PARAMETER EVIDENCE:
   - Updated temp_recruit_opt (28.5°C) has very tight bounds (28-29°C), suggesting temperature is permissive rather than limiting
   - Coral growth rates now essentially fixed, indicating these are well-constrained
   - Current Gaussian temperature response may be too smooth for episodic dynamics

3. ECOLOGICAL REALISM:
   - Real COTS outbreaks correlate with flood events → nutrient pulses → phytoplankton blooms → larval survival
   - Outbreaks are episodic (every 10-17 years) not continuous, requiring threshold/trigger mechanism
   - Current model would produce gradual population changes, not boom-bust cycles

CHOSEN IMPROVEMENT: NUTRIENT-MEDIATED LARVAL STAGE

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
Crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks on the GBR are fundamentally driven by episodic nutrient enrichment events (river floods, upwelling) that create phytoplankton blooms during the larval phase. This two-stage population structure is essential for capturing:

1. OUTBREAK TRIGGERS: Nutrient pulses → enhanced larval survival → delayed adult outbreak (1-2 year lag)
2. BOOM-BUST CYCLES: Episodic favorable conditions create population explosions followed by crashes
3. SPATIAL CONNECTIVITY: Immigration represents larval dispersal between reefs, not adult movement
4. THRESHOLD DYNAMICS: Larval survival threshold creates non-linear outbreak initiation

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Stage 1 - Larval Production and Survival:
- Adult COTS produce larvae (fecundity × adult density)
- Larval survival depends on nutrient availability (proxy: can use temperature anomalies or create nutrient index)
- Immigration adds to larval pool (representing connectivity)
- Allee effect operates on adult spawning success

Stage 2 - Adult Recruitment and Dynamics:
- Larvae settle and recruit to adult stage (with time lag)
- Adults experience density-dependent mortality
- Adults consume coral (existing functional responses)
- Coral consumption feeds back to adult condition

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
1. log_larval_survival_base: Baseline larval survival rate (0.001-0.01, most larvae die)
2. log_nutrient_effect_strength: How strongly nutrients boost larval survival (episodic multiplier)
3. log_fecundity: Eggs per adult COTS (literature: 10-65 million eggs, use effective fecundity)
4. log_settlement_rate: Proportion of larvae that successfully settle (0.0001-0.001)
5. log_larval_mortality: Larval stage mortality rate (high: 0.5-2.0 per week)

NUTRIENT PROXY:
Using SST anomalies as proxy for nutrient conditions (negative anomalies often correlate with upwelling/mixing that brings nutrients). Alternative: could add explicit nutrient data vector if available.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Episodic adult outbreaks following favorable larval conditions
- Realistic 1-2 year lag between trigger and outbreak
- Boom-bust population dynamics
- Better capture of outbreak timing and magnitude
- Immigration now ecologically meaningful (larval connectivity)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Larval stage uses daily/weekly timescale internally but integrates to annual model timestep
- Nutrient effect uses threshold response (not gradual) to create episodic dynamics
- Maintains all existing coral dynamics and predation mechanisms
- Backward compatible: if nutrient effect = 0, reduces to simpler recruitment model
