MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model includes sophisticated mechanisms for COTS outbreak dynamics:
- Temperature-dependent recruitment with nutrient-mediated larval survival
- Age-structured mortality with temperature-dependent maturation (Q10)
- Local spawning feedback creating self-sustaining outbreaks
- Asymmetric thermal performance curves for coral growth
- Coral recruitment with Allee effects and space limitation

However, a critical ecological process is missing: COTS predation pressure on coral reproductive capacity.

=== IDENTIFIED GAP ===

Current coral recruitment (Equations 17 & 21) depends only on:
- Temperature (settlement success)
- Density-dependent factors (Allee effects, space limitation)
- Current coral cover

But it IGNORES the impact of active COTS predation on coral fecundity.

Ecological reality:
- COTS consume reproductive coral tissue, reducing larval production
- High predation pressure creates a demographic bottleneck
- This delays coral recovery even after COTS populations decline
- The effect is stronger for fast-growing corals (preferred prey)

This omission likely causes the model to:
- Overestimate coral recovery rates during/after outbreaks
- Underestimate outbreak duration
- Miss the lagged demographic response in coral populations

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add COTS-mediated suppression of coral recruitment through predation pressure terms.

Mathematical approach:
- Calculate predation pressure as consumption rate relative to coral biomass
- Apply exponential decay function to reduce recruitment potential
- Use differential sensitivity (fast corals more suppressed than slow corals)

New parameters:
- log_predation_suppression_fast: Sensitivity of fast coral recruitment to predation pressure
- log_predation_suppression_slow: Sensitivity of slow coral recruitment to predation pressure

Ecological justification:
1. Acropora (fast corals) are preferentially consumed and have higher turnover
   → Higher suppression sensitivity (stronger demographic impact)

2. Massive corals (slow corals) are less preferred and more persistent
   → Lower suppression sensitivity (more resilient reproduction)

3. Saturating response prevents complete recruitment failure
   → Maintains biological realism (some larvae always produced)

Expected outcomes:
- Extended outbreak duration through delayed coral recovery
- More realistic boom-bust dynamics with demographic lags
- Better capture of the multi-year recovery periods observed on GBR
- Improved fit to data showing slow coral community recovery post-outbreak

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on:
- Accurately capturing outbreak timing and duration
- Understanding mechanisms that sustain outbreak events
- Predicting characteristic boom-bust cycles
