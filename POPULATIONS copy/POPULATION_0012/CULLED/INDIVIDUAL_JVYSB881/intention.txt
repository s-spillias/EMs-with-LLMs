MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing model captures fundamental COTS-coral dynamics including:
- Temperature-dependent larval survival (Gaussian response)
- Allee effects maintaining low-density equilibria
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Logistic coral growth with interspecific competition
- Density-dependent and starvation mortality

However, the model has critical limitations for capturing episodic outbreak dynamics:

1. MISSING OUTBREAK TRIGGER: The model lacks a mechanism to explain sudden transitions from low-density to outbreak states. While the Allee effect creates bistability, it doesn't explain what triggers the rapid population explosions characteristic of COTS outbreaks on the GBR.

2. OVERSIMPLIFIED RECRUITMENT: Current recruitment is simply proportional to adult density modified by temperature and Allee effects. This misses the critical ecological reality that COTS larval survival is strongly food-limited. Phytoplankton availability during the ~2-3 week larval period is the key bottleneck determining recruitment success.

3. ECOLOGICAL CONTEXT: GBR COTS outbreaks are strongly associated with terrestrial runoff events (flood plumes) that deliver nutrients, stimulating phytoplankton blooms. These create episodic windows of high larval food availability and recruitment success. This is the primary mechanism creating the "boom" phase of boom-bust cycles.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: NUTRIENT-MEDIATED RECRUITMENT AMPLIFICATION

Add a nutrient effect on larval survival to capture episodic recruitment pulses:

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- COTS larvae are planktotrophic (feed on phytoplankton) for 2-3 weeks before settlement
- Larval survival and development rate are strongly food-limited
- Terrestrial runoff delivers nutrients → phytoplankton blooms → high larval survival
- This creates episodic recruitment "windows" that trigger outbreaks
- Explains the spatial pattern of outbreaks (initiation in northern GBR near river inputs)
- Explains temporal clustering of outbreaks with flood years

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Add a saturating (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient effect on recruitment:
- nutrient_effect = 1 + (max_effect - 1) * (nutrient^n / (K_nutrient^n + nutrient^n))
- This creates a threshold response: low nutrients = baseline recruitment, high nutrients = amplified recruitment
- Saturation prevents unrealistic recruitment at extreme nutrient levels
- Exponent n controls the sharpness of the threshold (higher n = more switch-like)

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
The nutrient effect mechanism has been added to the model code with parameters:
- log_nutrient_effect_max: maximum recruitment amplification from nutrients
- log_nutrient_halfsat: half-saturation constant (nutrient level for 50% of max effect)
- nutrient_exponent: Hill coefficient controlling threshold sharpness

CURRENT STATE:
The nutrient effect is currently DISABLED (set to 1.0, no amplification) because nutrient data (nutrient_dat) is not yet available in the dataset. The model will run with baseline recruitment dynamics until nutrient data is provided.

TO ACTIVATE NUTRIENT EFFECTS:
1. Add a nutrient_dat column to the data file (proxy: chlorophyll-a, river discharge, or rainfall)
2. Uncomment the nutrient effect calculation in model.cpp (lines marked with "Future implementation")
3. The model will then capture episodic recruitment pulses during high-nutrient periods

EXPECTED OUTCOMES (when activated):
- Episodic recruitment pulses during high-nutrient periods (boom phase)
- Low background recruitment during normal conditions
- Outbreaks triggered by nutrient events, then sustained by Allee effects
- Bust phase through existing density-dependent mortality and coral depletion
- Better alignment with observed outbreak patterns on GBR

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding the single most important missing process for capturing episodic outbreak dynamics in the GBR context. The mechanism is ready to be activated once appropriate nutrient proxy data becomes available.
