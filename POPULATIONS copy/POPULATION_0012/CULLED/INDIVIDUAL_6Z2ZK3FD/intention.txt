MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model includes key COTS-coral dynamics but lacks the stage-structure necessary to capture episodic outbreak dynamics.

Current strengths:
- Allee effect for density-dependent recruitment
- Temperature-dependent processes
- Functional response predation
- Coral competition and thermal stress

Critical gaps for PROJECT CONTEXT:
1. Single-stage COTS population cannot generate multi-year outbreak buildup
2. Missing juvenile bottleneck - the key driver of outbreak episodicity
3. Recruitment is instantaneous rather than delayed through maturation
4. No mechanism for multi-year favorable conditions to accumulate into outbreaks

Parameter updates suggest model refinement needed:
- log_temp_recruit_opt updated to 3.3495 (28.5°C) with very tight bounds (3.332-3.367)
- This precision indicates temperature window is critical but current Gaussian may be too smooth
- log_fast_growth_rate and log_slow_growth_rate have extremely tight bounds from literature
- These suggest the equations are well-calibrated but missing structural components

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add stage-structured COTS population with explicit juvenile stage:

ECOLOGICAL RATIONALE:
- COTS outbreaks are driven by exceptional juvenile survival during favorable years
- Juveniles (0-2 years) have 95-99% mortality normally, but this drops to 50-80% during outbreak initiation
- Multiple consecutive years of high juvenile survival create the characteristic multi-year buildup
- Adults live 3-7 years, creating temporal separation between recruitment pulses
- This structure naturally generates boom-bust cycles with realistic inter-outbreak periods

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Split COTS into juveniles (J) and adults (A)
2. Juvenile dynamics:
   - Recruitment from adults (temperature and Allee dependent)
   - High baseline mortality (0.9-0.99 year⁻¹)
   - Food-dependent survival (coral availability reduces starvation)
   - Maturation rate to adults (0.5 year⁻¹, representing 2-year juvenile period)

3. Adult dynamics:
   - Recruitment from maturing juveniles
   - Lower mortality (current adult mortality)
   - Predation on corals (current functional response)
   - Immigration adds to juveniles (larvae settle as juveniles)

4. Key outbreak mechanism:
   - Normal years: high juvenile mortality prevents population growth
   - Favorable years: warm temperature + high coral cover → juvenile survival increases
   - Multiple favorable years → juvenile cohorts accumulate → mature into outbreak
   - Outbreak: adults consume coral → reduces juvenile survival → population crashes

NEW PARAMETERS NEEDED:
- log_juvenile_mort_base: baseline juvenile mortality (log(2.0) = 0.693, range 0.0 to 2.303 for 1.0-10.0 year⁻¹)
- log_maturation_rate: juvenile to adult transition (log(0.5) = -0.693, range -1.609 to 0.0 for 0.2-1.0 year⁻¹)
- log_juvenile_food_effect: coral availability effect on juvenile survival (log(0.5) = -0.693, range -2.303 to 0.0)
- log_larval_settlement: larval to juvenile conversion (log(0.1) = -2.303, range -4.605 to -0.693)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Episodic outbreaks with 10-15 year return periods
- Multi-year buildup phase (2-4 years of increasing juveniles)
- Rapid outbreak phase (1-2 years of high adult density)
- Crash phase (1-2 years as coral depletes)
- Long recovery phase (5-10 years of low density)
- Realistic sensitivity to temperature anomalies
- Coral recovery limitation after outbreaks

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" and "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events."
