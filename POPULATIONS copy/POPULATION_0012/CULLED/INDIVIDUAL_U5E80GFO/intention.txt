MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a mechanistic COTS-coral predator-prey system with:
- Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response around optimal temperature)
- Allee effects for low-density population dynamics
- Immigration contribution to recruitment
- Type II functional responses with prey switching
- Logistic coral growth with interspecific competition
- Temperature stress mortality for corals

STRENGTHS:
- Comprehensive representation of predator-prey dynamics
- Appropriate use of Type II functional responses
- Prey switching mechanism for realistic foraging
- Temperature effects on both COTS and corals

WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED:
1. Missing the PRIMARY ecological driver of COTS outbreaks: nutrient-mediated larval survival
2. Literature emphasizes that episodic outbreaks are triggered by elevated nutrients from terrestrial runoff
3. Current model relies only on temperature and Allee effects, which don't capture pulsed outbreak dynamics
4. Immigration is treated as a simple additive term rather than being modulated by environmental conditions

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT SELECTED ===

ADDITION: Nutrient-mediated larval survival mechanism

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
Crown-of-thorns starfish have a planktonic larval phase lasting 2-4 weeks during which they feed on phytoplankton. Larval survival to settlement is highly sensitive to food availability. Terrestrial runoff events (associated with flooding) deliver nutrients that stimulate phytoplankton blooms, dramatically increasing larval survival rates. This mechanism is widely recognized as the primary trigger for COTS outbreak initiation on the Great Barrier Reef.

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Add a nutrient proxy variable that modulates recruitment success. Since direct nutrient data may not be available, we can use a combination of:
1. Rainfall/runoff proxy (if available in data)
2. OR a latent environmental quality variable estimated from COTS recruitment patterns
3. Implement as a multiplicative modifier on recruitment rate

The nutrient effect will:
- Amplify recruitment during favorable (high nutrient) periods
- Create the episodic, pulsed outbreak dynamics observed in nature
- Interact with temperature and Allee effects to determine outbreak probability
- Better explain multi-year outbreak persistence followed by collapse

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- log_nutrient_effect_strength: Controls how strongly nutrients amplify recruitment
- log_nutrient_baseline: Background nutrient effect level
- log_nutrient_decay: Rate at which nutrient pulses decay over time

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT requirement to "accurately capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" by incorporating the key environmental trigger for outbreak events.

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

Since we don't have direct nutrient measurements, I'll implement a simplified approach:
- Use SST anomalies and immigration rates as proxies for environmental favorability
- Create a composite "larval survival index" that captures favorable conditions
- This index modulates the baseline recruitment rate

Alternative if data permits: Add a DATA_VECTOR for rainfall/runoff if available in future iterations.

The mathematical form will be:
larval_survival_factor = nutrient_baseline + nutrient_effect_strength * f(environmental_conditions)

Where f() is a function of available environmental proxies that correlate with nutrient availability and phytoplankton productivity.
