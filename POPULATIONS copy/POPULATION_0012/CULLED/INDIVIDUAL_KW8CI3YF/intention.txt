CROWN OF THORNS STARFISH OUTBREAK MODEL

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, capturing the characteristic boom-bust cycles observed in field data.

KEY ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (critical for outbreak initiation)
   - Immigration of larvae from external sources (episodic forcing)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival and development
   - Density-dependent mortality at high abundances (resource limitation, disease)
   - Natural mortality from predation and senescence

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Two functional groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites)
   - Logistic growth with different intrinsic rates
   - Differential susceptibility to COTS predation (Acropora preferred)
   - Competition for space between coral groups
   - Temperature stress effects on coral growth and mortality

3. COTS-Coral Interactions:
   - Type II functional response for COTS feeding on each coral group
   - Prey switching behavior (preference for fast-growing when abundant)
   - Feeding rate modulated by total coral availability
   - Coral depletion triggers COTS starvation and population collapse

4. Environmental Forcing:
   - Sea surface temperature affects COTS larval survival (optimal range)
   - Temperature stress on coral growth and bleaching mortality
   - Larval immigration events trigger outbreak initiation

5. Outbreak Mechanisms:
   - Allee effect allows rapid population growth once threshold density reached
   - High larval immigration combined with favorable temperatures initiates outbreaks
   - Abundant coral resources sustain high COTS densities
   - Resource depletion and density-dependent mortality cause population collapse
   - Recovery period required before next outbreak cycle

The model predicts COTS abundance and coral cover for both functional groups, capturing the observed multi-year outbreak cycles with rapid exponential growth phases followed by crashes.
