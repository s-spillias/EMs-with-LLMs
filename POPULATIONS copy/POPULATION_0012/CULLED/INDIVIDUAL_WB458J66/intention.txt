MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Comprehensive recruitment mechanism with both immigration and local spawning
2. Age-structured mortality (juvenile vs. adult) with temperature-dependent maturation
3. Nutrient-mediated larval survival threshold for outbreak triggering
4. Type II functional response for coral predation
5. Temperature effects on coral growth via thermal performance curves

Parameter Updates from Literature:
- temp_optimal_slow has been constrained to 27.0Â°C with high precision (bounds: 27.0-27.000000027)
- This suggests strong empirical evidence for slow coral thermal optimum
- Current model structure appropriately uses this in thermal performance curve

Weaknesses Identified:
1. MISSING SIZE-STRUCTURED PREDATION: The model treats all adult COTS as equivalent predators, but in reality:
   - Juveniles (<15cm, 0-2 years): Feed primarily on algae, minimal coral consumption
   - Small adults (15-25cm, 2-3 years): Moderate coral predation, newly reproductive
   - Large adults (25-35cm, 3-5 years): High coral predation, peak fecundity
   - Very large adults (>35cm, 5+ years): Maximum predation rates (2-3x small adults)

2. This oversimplification affects outbreak dynamics:
   - Underestimates lag between recruitment and coral damage
   - Misses the accelerating damage phase as cohorts grow
   - Doesn't capture how large individuals sustain outbreaks

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add SIZE-STRUCTURED PREDATION EFFICIENCY

Ecological Mechanism:
- Track average body size of COTS population as a state variable
- Size increases through somatic growth (von Bertalanffy or similar)
- Size decreases through recruitment dilution (new recruits are small)
- Attack rates scale non-linearly with body size (allometric scaling)

Mathematical Implementation:
1. New state variable: mean_size (cm diameter)
2. Size dynamics: dSize/dt = growth_rate * (max_size - size) - recruitment_dilution_effect
3. Size-dependent attack rates: attack_rate(size) = attack_base * (size/size_ref)^scaling_exponent
4. Scaling exponent ~2-3 reflects metabolic and geometric scaling of feeding

Ecological Justification:
- Captures the 2-3 year lag between recruitment pulses and major coral damage
- Explains why outbreaks persist: large individuals continue heavy predation even as recruitment declines
- Matches field observations: outbreak severity correlates with COTS size distribution, not just density
- Improves prediction of outbreak duration: large cohorts take years to die off

Parameters to Add:
1. log_size_growth_rate: Rate at which COTS approach maximum size (year^-1)
2. max_body_size: Asymptotic maximum COTS diameter (cm)
3. size_at_recruitment: Size of newly recruited juveniles (cm)
4. log_size_scaling_exponent: Allometric scaling of attack rate with body size (dimensionless)
5. reference_body_size: Reference size for attack rate normalization (cm)

Expected Improvements:
- Better capture of outbreak timing (delayed coral impact after recruitment)
- More realistic outbreak trajectories (accelerating damage phase)
- Improved prediction of outbreak duration (large individuals sustain damage)
- Better fit to boom-bust cycles in PROJECT CONTEXT

Implementation Notes:
- Size state variable initialized at intermediate value (e.g., 20cm)
- Growth follows von Bertalanffy-like dynamics toward max_size
- Recruitment dilutes mean size toward size_at_recruitment
- Attack rates for both fast and slow corals scale with (size/reference_size)^exponent
- Exponent of 2-3 reflects surface area and metabolic scaling
