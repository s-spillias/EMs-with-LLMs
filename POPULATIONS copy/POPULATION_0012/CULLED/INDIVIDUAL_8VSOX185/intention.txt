MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model incorporates several sophisticated mechanisms for COTS outbreak dynamics:
- Allee effects for population establishment
- Temperature-dependent larval survival
- Nutrient-mediated enhancement of recruitment
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Bleaching-induced coral mortality

However, analysis of updated parameter values reveals an ecological gap:
- temp_opt_coral = 29.0째C (updated from literature)
- temp_opt_cots = 28.5째C (initial estimate)
- These similar optima don't capture differential thermal responses

IDENTIFIED ECOLOGICAL GAP:
The model lacks a mechanism for temperature-dependent feeding efficiency. Ecological research shows that COTS can exploit thermally-stressed corals more effectively because:
1. Coral defenses (mucus production, nematocysts) decline under thermal stress
2. Coral tissue becomes more accessible to COTS feeding
3. COTS metabolic rates increase with temperature up to ~30째C
4. This creates a "thermal window" where COTS gain competitive advantage

This process is critical for outbreak dynamics because sub-bleaching thermal stress (28-30째C) can amplify COTS impacts before bleaching mortality occurs.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add temperature-dependent feeding efficiency that modulates COTS attack rates based on thermal stress to coral. This is implemented as a multiplier on attack rates that:
- Equals 1.0 at coral optimal temperature (no enhancement)
- Increases when temperature rises above coral optimum but below bleaching threshold
- Captures the "thermal stress window" where COTS gain advantage
- Uses a Gaussian-like response centered above coral optimum

NEW PARAMETER:
- log_thermal_feeding_boost: Log maximum feeding efficiency enhancement during thermal stress
  * Ecological meaning: How much more effectively COTS feed on thermally-stressed coral
  * Expected range: 0.0 to 1.609 (1x to 5x enhancement)
  * This parameter is bounded and has clear biological interpretation

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
The thermal feeding efficiency (theta) is calculated as:
theta = 1 + thermal_feeding_boost * exp(-((T - T_stress_peak)^2) / (2 * sigma_stress^2))

Where:
- T_stress_peak = temp_opt_coral + 0.5 * bleach_threshold (midpoint of stress window)
- sigma_stress = 0.3 * bleach_threshold (width of stress window)
- This creates a peak enhancement when corals are stressed but not yet bleaching

The thermal feeding efficiency multiplier is applied to both attack_fast and attack_slow in the functional response calculations, representing increased feeding efficiency on stressed corals.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
This improvement:
1. Captures a well-documented ecological process (COTS exploitation of stressed corals)
2. Creates a mechanistic link between temperature and outbreak severity
3. Explains why outbreaks often coincide with warming events
4. Maintains model parsimony (single parameter)
5. Has clear biological bounds and interpretation
6. Addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on outbreak triggers and dynamics

EXPECTED IMPACT:
This modification should improve the model's ability to:
- Capture outbreak timing relative to thermal events
- Predict outbreak magnitude during warm periods
- Represent the synergistic effects of temperature on COTS-coral dynamics
- Maintain realistic boom-bust cycles with appropriate environmental triggers
