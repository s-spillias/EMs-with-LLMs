MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Comprehensive age-structured COTS population dynamics with temperature-dependent maturation
- Nutrient-mediated larval survival creating outbreak triggers
- Local spawning feedback sustaining outbreaks
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Temperature effects on recruitment

Areas for Improvement:
- Symmetric Gaussian thermal performance curves don't capture realistic coral responses to heat stress
- Missing bleaching dynamics that create vulnerability windows for COTS outbreaks
- No representation of asymmetric thermal tolerance (corals more sensitive to warming than cooling)

=== PARAMETER VALUE ANALYSIS ===

Key observation: temp_optimal_slow has been updated from literature with extremely tight bounds (27.0 to 27.000000027°C), 
essentially fixing this parameter. This strong constraint suggests:
1. Literature provides precise estimates of slow coral thermal optima
2. Current symmetric Gaussian may be inadequate for capturing the full thermal response
3. Need for more sophisticated thermal performance representation

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Implementation: Asymmetric Thermal Performance Curves with Bleaching Threshold

Ecological Justification:
1. Coral thermal performance is inherently asymmetric - gradual decline with cooling, sharp decline with warming
2. Above a critical threshold, corals experience bleaching stress causing rapid growth decline
3. Fast-growing Acropora are more thermally sensitive than slow-growing massive corals
4. Heat stress events create vulnerability windows where COTS outbreaks can be particularly devastating
5. This captures the episodic nature of outbreak dynamics in the PROJECT CONTEXT

Mathematical Approach:
- Below optimal: gradual polynomial decline (cold tolerance)
- Near optimal: peak performance plateau
- Above bleaching threshold: exponential decline (heat stress/bleaching)
- Different thresholds and sensitivities for fast vs. slow corals

New Parameters Added:
- temp_bleaching_fast: Temperature threshold for fast coral bleaching onset (°C)
- temp_bleaching_slow: Temperature threshold for slow coral bleaching onset (°C)  
- log_bleaching_sensitivity_fast: Log sensitivity to temperatures above bleaching threshold for fast corals
- log_bleaching_sensitivity_slow: Log sensitivity to temperatures above bleaching threshold for slow corals
- log_cold_tolerance_fast: Log tolerance to temperatures below optimal for fast corals
- log_cold_tolerance_slow: Log tolerance to temperatures below optimal for slow corals

This improvement:
- Maintains all existing outbreak mechanisms
- Adds realistic thermal stress dynamics
- Creates natural vulnerability windows for COTS impacts
- Better represents the boom-bust cycles in the PROJECT CONTEXT
- Justified by the precise literature constraints on thermal optima
