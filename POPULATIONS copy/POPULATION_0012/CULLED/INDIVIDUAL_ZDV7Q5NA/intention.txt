MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a mechanistically rich COTS-coral predator-prey system with:
1. Temperature-dependent recruitment with Gaussian response
2. Nutrient-mediated larval survival as outbreak trigger (sigmoidal threshold)
3. Multiple mortality components (baseline, Allee, density, food limitation)
4. Type II functional response for selective coral predation
5. Logistic growth for fast and slow coral guilds

STRENGTHS:
- Captures non-linear outbreak triggering via nutrient proxy
- Includes both environmental (SST) and demographic (Allee) mechanisms
- Distinguishes coral functional groups with different vulnerabilities
- Implements handling time constraints on predation

=== CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED ===

PARAMETER ANALYSIS:
The parameter "log_cots_mort_base" has been updated from literature with value 0.939 (mortality = 2.56 year⁻¹).
This represents ~93% annual mortality, which is:
- Appropriate for JUVENILE COTS (age 0-2 years): 80-90% mortality documented
- Too high for ADULT COTS (age 2+ years): typically 30-50% mortality
- Inconsistent with adult lifespan of 3-7 years in field studies

ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCE:
The current single-rate mortality model cannot simultaneously represent:
1. High juvenile mortality (necessary for realistic population regulation)
2. Lower adult mortality (necessary for outbreak persistence and coral impact)

This oversimplification likely:
- Underestimates outbreak magnitude (juveniles die too fast during favorable conditions)
- Overestimates outbreak collapse rate (adults die too fast)
- Fails to capture cohort-driven boom-bust dynamics

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: AGE-STRUCTURED MORTALITY ===

ECOLOGICAL RATIONALE:
COTS outbreaks are fundamentally driven by cohort dynamics:
- Massive recruitment pulses create juvenile-dominated populations
- High juvenile mortality normally prevents outbreaks
- During favorable conditions (nutrients + temperature), enough juveniles survive to maturity
- Mature cohorts have lower mortality, sustaining multi-year outbreaks
- As recruitment declines and cohort ages, population eventually crashes

MATHEMATICAL APPROACH:
Implement continuous age-structure tracking via population "maturity":
- Track mean population age/maturity as state variable
- Mortality decreases from juvenile rate to adult rate as maturity increases
- Recruitment pulses decrease mean maturity (influx of juveniles)
- Aging increases maturity over time
- Mortality rate becomes maturity-dependent

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Add state variable: cots_maturity (0 = all juveniles, 1 = all adults)
2. Add parameters:
   - log_cots_mort_juvenile: high mortality for age 0-2 (use literature value ~2.56)
   - log_cots_mort_adult: lower mortality for age 2+ (~0.4-0.7 year⁻¹)
   - maturity_rate: rate of transition from juvenile to adult stage
3. Modify mortality calculation:
   - Interpolate between juvenile and adult rates based on maturity
   - Use smooth transition (e.g., sigmoidal or linear interpolation)
4. Update maturity dynamics:
   - Recruitment decreases maturity (dilution with juveniles)
   - Time increases maturity (aging)
   - Mortality removes individuals proportional to current age distribution

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- More realistic outbreak initiation (juveniles can survive favorable conditions)
- Sustained outbreak periods (adults persist longer)
- Sharper boom-bust transitions (cohort aging effects)
- Better match to observed multi-year outbreak durations
- Maintains population persistence between outbreaks

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
maturity(t) = f(recruitment_dilution, aging_rate, mortality_selection)
mortality(t) = mort_juvenile + (mort_adult - mort_juvenile) * maturity(t)

This captures essential age-structure without full age-class complexity.
