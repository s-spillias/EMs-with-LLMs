MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a mechanistic COTS-coral system with:
- Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response)
- Nutrient-mediated larval survival (sigmoidal threshold)
- Age-structured mortality (juvenile vs adult)
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Logistic coral growth with carrying capacities

STRENGTHS:
- Captures multiple outbreak drivers (temperature, nutrients, immigration)
- Age structure allows realistic mortality transitions
- Differential predation on fast vs slow corals
- Non-linear threshold dynamics via nutrient response

WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED:
1. Recruitment is independent of reef habitat quality
2. No feedback between coral community state and COTS settlement success
3. Missing ecological reality: juvenile COTS require coral rubble/CCA for settlement
4. Outbreak termination relies only on food depletion, not habitat degradation

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT ===

ADDITION: Habitat Quality Modifier for Recruitment

ECOLOGICAL RATIONALE:
Crown-of-thorns starfish larvae settle preferentially on crustose coralline algae (CCA) 
and coral rubble. Early juvenile survival (0-6 months) depends critically on:
- Availability of cryptic refugia in coral framework
- Presence of biofilm and microalgae associated with healthy coral communities
- Protection from predators in complex reef structure

When coral cover is high and diverse, the reef provides:
- More settlement substrate (CCA grows better on healthy reefs)
- Better refugia for juveniles (complex 3D structure)
- Higher food availability for early juveniles (biofilm on coral surfaces)

When coral cover is depleted:
- Settlement substrate degrades
- Structural complexity collapses
- Juvenile survival plummets

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Add a saturating function of total coral cover that modifies recruitment:

habitat_quality = (total_coral^habitat_exponent) / (habitat_halfsat^habitat_exponent + total_coral^habitat_exponent)

This creates:
- Low recruitment when coral cover is very low (degraded reef)
- Increasing recruitment as coral cover increases (better habitat)
- Saturation at high coral cover (diminishing returns)
- Positive feedback: healthy reefs → better recruitment → potential outbreaks
- Negative feedback: severe depletion → poor recruitment → outbreak termination

PARAMETERS ADDED:
1. log_habitat_effect: Strength of habitat quality effect on recruitment
2. habitat_halfsat: Coral cover at which habitat quality reaches 50% of maximum
3. habitat_exponent: Steepness of habitat quality response (Hill coefficient)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- More realistic outbreak dynamics tied to reef condition
- Natural outbreak termination when coral depletion degrades habitat
- Threshold behavior: outbreaks more likely on healthy vs degraded reefs
- Better captures boom-bust cycles in PROJECT CONTEXT
- Explains why outbreaks often occur on relatively healthy reefs

EQUATION MODIFICATION:
Equation 3 becomes:
recruitment = cots_recruit_base * cotsimm_dat * temp_response * larval_survival * habitat_quality

This maintains all existing mechanisms while adding ecologically grounded habitat feedback.
