MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model includes sophisticated mechanisms for COTS population dynamics:
- Allee effects for outbreak initiation (allee_strength, allee_threshold)
- Density-dependent fecundity enhancement (max_fecundity_boost, fecundity_halfsat)
- Temperature-mediated larval survival (temp_opt_cots, temp_width_cots)
- Nutrient-proxy enhancement via SST anomalies (nutrient_effect_strength)
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Two coral functional groups with differential vulnerability

However, analysis reveals a critical missing mechanism:

IDENTIFIED GAP:
--------------
The current nutrient effect (Equation 1b) uses positive SST anomalies as a proxy for 
nutrient-rich conditions. However, the parameter log_nutrient_effect = 0.0 (no enhancement)
suggests this indirect proxy is insufficient. 

ECOLOGICAL LITERATURE INSIGHT:
-----------------------------
COTS outbreaks consistently occur on HEALTHY, HIGH-CORAL-COVER reefs, not degraded ones.
This paradox is explained by reef structural complexity effects on larval ecology:

1. High coral cover → complex 3D reef structure
2. Complex structure → enhanced water retention and reduced flushing
3. Reduced flushing → accumulation of phytoplankton (larval food)
4. More larval food → higher COTS larval survival
5. More COTS → coral predation → reduced complexity → crash

This creates a natural boom-bust cycle where outbreaks are SELF-LIMITING through 
habitat degradation.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
--------------------
Add a coral-cover-dependent larval food availability modifier that replaces the 
ineffective SST-anomaly proxy. This creates a mechanistic positive feedback during
the boom phase and a natural negative feedback during the bust phase.

NEW MECHANISM: Coral-Mediated Larval Survival
----------------------------------------------
Replace nutrient_enhancement calculation with a coral-cover-dependent function:

larval_food_availability = 1 + max_food_enhancement * (total_coral^food_exponent) / 
                               (food_halfsat^food_exponent + total_coral^food_exponent)

Where:
- total_coral = fast_pred(t-1) + slow_pred(t-1) = reef structural complexity proxy
- max_food_enhancement = maximum increase in larval survival on high-cover reefs
- food_halfsat = coral cover at which food enhancement is half-maximal
- food_exponent = steepness of response (Hill coefficient)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
------------------------
1. MECHANISTIC: Directly links reef structure to larval survival via food availability
2. SELF-LIMITING: Outbreaks naturally crash as coral is consumed
3. THRESHOLD BEHAVIOR: Outbreaks only occur above critical coral cover
4. LITERATURE SUPPORT: Explains observed pattern of outbreaks on healthy reefs
5. PARSIMONY: Replaces ineffective nutrient proxy with direct mechanism

EXPECTED DYNAMICS:
-----------------
- High coral cover (>40%) → enhanced larval survival → outbreak initiation
- Outbreak consumes coral → reduced cover → declining larval survival
- Low coral cover (<20%) → minimal larval survival → COTS crash
- Coral recovery → cycle repeats

This single mechanism should dramatically improve model fit to boom-bust patterns
while maintaining ecological realism and parsimony.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
--------------------
- Remove: nutrient_enhancement calculation (Equation 1b)
- Remove: log_nutrient_effect parameter
- Add: log_max_food_enhancement parameter (suggested range: 0.69 to 2.30, i.e., 2x to 10x)
- Add: log_food_halfsat parameter (suggested range: 3.0 to 4.0, i.e., 20-55% coral cover)
- Add: food_exponent parameter (suggested range: 2.0 to 5.0 for cooperative response)
- Modify: Equation 10 to use larval_food_availability instead of nutrient_enhancement
