Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) Outbreak Model with Coral Community Dynamics

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) on the Great Barrier Reef and their impacts on coral communities. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations through several key mechanisms:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Larval immigration drives recruitment, with temperature-dependent survival creating outbreak triggers
   - Density-dependent mortality at low densities (Allee effects) and high densities (resource limitation)
   - Adult survival influenced by coral availability (food limitation)

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.) with high growth rates but high COTS predation vulnerability
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites spp.) with lower growth rates but greater resistance to predation
   - Logistic growth with carrying capacity representing space limitation on reefs
   - Differential predation pressure from COTS based on coral type preferences

3. Outbreak Mechanisms:
   - Temperature anomalies enhance larval survival, triggering recruitment pulses
   - Larval immigration provides external forcing that can initiate outbreaks
   - Positive feedback through reduced predation pressure at high COTS densities
   - Coral depletion eventually limits COTS populations, causing bust phases

4. Predator-Prey Dynamics:
   - Type II functional response for COTS feeding on corals
   - Preferential feeding on fast-growing Acropora species
   - Food limitation feedback where coral depletion increases COTS mortality
   - Conversion efficiency from coral consumption to COTS population growth

The model predicts COTS abundance and coral cover for both fast and slow-growing species, capturing the multi-year outbreak cycles and their devastating impacts on reef communities. Temperature and larval immigration are external forcing variables that drive outbreak timing and magnitude.
