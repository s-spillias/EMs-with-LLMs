MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE
==========================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model includes sophisticated mechanisms for:
- Age-structured mortality (juvenile vs adult phases)
- Temperature-dependent recruitment with Gaussian response
- Nutrient-mediated larval survival threshold (outbreak trigger)
- Type II functional response for coral predation
- Allee effects and density-dependent mortality

However, the model treats larval immigration (cotsimm_dat) as purely exogenous forcing, missing a critical ecological feedback.

IDENTIFIED GAP:
--------------
COTS outbreaks on the GBR exhibit explosive, self-reinforcing dynamics because:
1. Adult COTS are highly fecund (millions of eggs per female per season)
2. Successful local recruitment produces adults that contribute larvae back to the system
3. This creates positive feedback: more adults → more larvae → more recruitment → more adults
4. This feedback is essential for generating the rapid "boom" phase of boom-bust cycles

The current model cannot generate this self-amplifying outbreak dynamic because recruitment depends only on external larval supply.

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
-----------------------
Add SELF-RECRUITMENT FEEDBACK mechanism:

New equation components:
1. Local larval production = fecundity × adult_abundance × maturity_state
   - Only mature adults reproduce
   - Fecundity scales with population maturity (older = more fecund)

2. Self-recruitment fraction = local larvae that successfully settle locally
   - Modified by larval retention (oceanographic conditions)
   - Subject to same temperature and nutrient-mediated survival as external larvae

3. Total recruitment = external immigration + self-recruitment
   - Both pathways experience same environmental filters
   - Self-recruitment creates positive feedback during favorable conditions

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
----------------------------
- Add parameter: log_fecundity (eggs per adult per year)
- Add parameter: log_self_recruit_fraction (proportion of local larvae settling locally)
- Modify recruitment equation to include both external and internal sources

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
-------------------------
This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT requirement to capture "episodic outbreaks" and "boom-bust cycles":

1. BOOM PHASE: When conditions are favorable (warm SST, nutrient pulses), both external and self-recruited larvae survive well. As adults accumulate, self-recruitment amplifies, creating explosive growth.

2. BUST PHASE: When coral food is depleted, adult mortality increases and fecundity may decline. Reduced adult abundance means less self-recruitment, breaking the positive feedback and causing population collapse.

3. EPISODIC NATURE: Outbreaks require alignment of:
   - External larval supply (regional connectivity)
   - Favorable environmental conditions (temperature, nutrients)
   - Sufficient adult abundance for self-recruitment feedback
   - Available coral food

This creates the observed pattern where outbreaks are sporadic rather than continuous.

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
-------------------
1. log_fecundity: Log of eggs produced per adult COTS per year
   - Literature: 12-24 million eggs per female per season (Pratchett et al. 2014)
   - Accounting for sex ratio (1:1) and multiple spawning events
   - Initial estimate: log(5e6) ≈ 15.4 (conservative)
   - This is eggs per adult; larval survival is handled separately

2. log_self_recruit_fraction: Log proportion of locally-produced larvae settling locally
   - Literature: Larval retention varies 0.1-10% depending on reef geometry and currents
   - Initial estimate: log(0.01) ≈ -4.6 (1% retention)
   - This captures oceanographic connectivity without explicit spatial modeling

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
------------------
- More realistic outbreak dynamics with rapid exponential growth phase
- Self-limiting outbreaks when coral food depletes
- Better capture of boom-bust cycle timing and magnitude
- Improved fit to observed COTS abundance patterns
- Maintains all existing mechanisms (temperature, nutrients, age structure)

This single improvement adds the most critical missing feedback for COTS outbreak dynamics while maintaining model parsimony.
