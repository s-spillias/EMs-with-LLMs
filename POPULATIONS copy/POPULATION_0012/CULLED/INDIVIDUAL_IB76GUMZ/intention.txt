MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE
==========================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model captures several key COTS outbreak mechanisms:
- Temperature-dependent larval survival (Gaussian response to SST)
- Nutrient-mediated recruitment amplification (sigmoidal threshold for bloom conditions)
- Age-structured mortality (high juvenile mortality ~2.56/year, lower adult mortality ~0.50/year)
- Selective coral predation with Type II functional response
- Allee effects at low density

However, analysis of the updated parameter values reveals a critical missing mechanism:

IDENTIFIED GAP: Age-Dependent Fecundity and Local Spawning Contribution
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current parameter values indicate:
- Very high juvenile mortality (exp(0.939) = 2.56 year⁻¹) 
- Much lower adult mortality (exp(-0.7) = 0.50 year⁻¹)
- Maturation period ~1.5 years (exp(-0.4) = 0.67 year⁻¹)

This strong age structure is well-captured in mortality dynamics, but recruitment (Equation 3) 
currently depends ONLY on external larval immigration and environmental conditions. It does not 
account for local spawning contribution from the resident adult population.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
-----------------------------------------
Crown-of-thorns starfish exhibit extreme size/age-dependent fecundity:
- Small/young adults: ~10,000-100,000 eggs per spawning event
- Large/old adults: 10-60 MILLION eggs per spawning event
- Fecundity scales approximately with body volume (size³)

This creates a critical positive feedback during outbreaks:
1. Initial recruitment from external larvae establishes small population
2. Survivors mature over 1.5-2 years with high juvenile mortality
3. Mature adults (high maturity state) produce massive local egg output
4. Local spawning contribution amplifies recruitment beyond external immigration
5. Positive feedback sustains outbreak even if external larval supply decreases

This mechanism is essential for capturing:
- EPISODIC nature of outbreaks (self-sustaining once triggered)
- MAGNITUDE of population explosions (exponential growth phase)
- DURATION of outbreaks (sustained by local reproduction)
- Boom-bust CYCLES (collapse when coral food depleted, breaking feedback)

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
---------------------
Add local spawning contribution to recruitment (Equation 3) that scales with:
1. Adult population density (cots_prev)
2. Population maturity state (maturity_prev) - captures age/size structure
3. Available coral food (total_coral) - fecundity depends on nutrition

Mathematical form:
  local_spawning = local_fecundity * cots_prev * maturity_prev² * (total_coral / K_coral)

Where:
- maturity_prev² creates non-linear scaling (older populations disproportionately more fecund)
- total_coral/K_coral represents nutritional state affecting egg production
- local_fecundity is a new parameter controlling strength of local reproduction

Modified recruitment becomes:
  recruitment = immigration_component + local_spawning_component

This maintains all existing mechanisms while adding the critical positive feedback that 
drives self-sustaining outbreaks characteristic of COTS population dynamics.

NEW PARAMETER ADDED:
-------------------
log_local_fecundity: Log-scale parameter for local spawning contribution to recruitment
- Units: (individuals/m²)/(individuals/m² · %cover) = dimensionless per %cover
- Ecological meaning: Per-capita egg production rate scaled by maturity and food availability
- Expected range: Should be calibrated so local spawning can match or exceed immigration 
  during outbreak conditions with high maturity and coral availability
- Initial estimate: log(0.5) = -0.69, allowing local spawning to contribute substantially
  when mature adults are well-fed
- Lower bound: -3.0 (minimal local contribution)
- Upper bound: 2.0 (strong local reproduction, but not unrealistically explosive)

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "accurately capturing 
the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" by incorporating the 
well-documented biological mechanism of age-dependent fecundity that creates self-sustaining 
outbreak dynamics.
