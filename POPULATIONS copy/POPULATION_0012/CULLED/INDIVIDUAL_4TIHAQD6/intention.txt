MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE
==========================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements age-structured COTS dynamics with environmental forcing (temperature, larval immigration), bloom-mediated larval survival, and coral-COTS-coral feedbacks. It captures key processes for boom-bust cycles but has a critical limitation in the temperature response function.

KEY FINDING FROM PARAMETER ANALYSIS:
The temp_optimal parameter has been updated from literature with tight bounds (28.0-29.0°C), indicating strong empirical support for a narrow optimal temperature range. However, the current symmetric Gaussian temperature response (Equation 2) treats deviations above and below optimal temperature identically:

  temp_response = exp(-temp_effect * (SST - temp_optimal)²)

This is ecologically unrealistic for COTS larvae.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR ASYMMETRIC RESPONSE:
Literature on COTS larval thermal tolerance shows:
1. BELOW optimal: Larvae tolerate cooler temperatures (26-28°C) with reduced but viable development rates
2. AT optimal: Maximum survival and development (28-29°C) 
3. ABOVE optimal: Rapid thermal stress mortality above 29-30°C

The symmetric Gaussian penalizes 27°C water (1.5°C below optimal) as much as 30°C water (1.5°C above optimal), but these have very different biological effects. Cooler water slows larval development but maintains survival, while warmer water causes physiological stress and mortality.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Asymmetric Thermal Performance Curve
Replace Equation 2 with a skewed thermal response that:
- Uses separate temperature sensitivity parameters for cooling (temp_effect_lower) vs warming (temp_effect_upper)
- Allows gentler decline in recruitment below optimal temperature
- Maintains steep decline above optimal temperature
- Better represents the 28.0-29.0°C optimal window from literature

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
For SST < temp_optimal:
  temp_response = exp(-temp_effect_lower * (temp_optimal - SST)²)
  
For SST >= temp_optimal:
  temp_response = exp(-temp_effect_upper * (SST - temp_optimal)²)

Where temp_effect_upper > temp_effect_lower to create asymmetry.

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
1. Broader recruitment window during cooler periods (26-28°C) supporting outbreak initiation
2. Maintained strong recruitment at optimal temperatures (28-29°C) 
3. Recruitment failure during thermal stress (>29.5°C)
4. More realistic outbreak persistence through variable temperature years
5. Better alignment with observed COTS outbreak patterns on GBR

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- log_temp_effect_lower: Sensitivity to cooling below optimal (gentler, ~0.3-1.0)
- log_temp_effect_upper: Sensitivity to warming above optimal (steeper, ~1.5-3.0)

The original log_temp_effect parameter will be deprecated in favor of these two asymmetric parameters.

This single structural change addresses a fundamental mismatch between the model's symmetric assumption and the asymmetric thermal biology of COTS larvae, improving the model's ability to capture outbreak dynamics under realistic temperature variability.
