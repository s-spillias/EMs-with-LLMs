MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:
The model provides a comprehensive framework for COTS-coral dynamics including Allee effects, temperature responses, and prey preferences. A recent addition (Equation 1b) introduced nutrient-mediated enhancement of larval survival using positive SST anomalies as a proxy for warm, wet conditions.

However, for the PROJECT CONTEXT of accurately capturing episodic outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration, the current model has a critical limitation:

IDENTIFIED GAP: Lack of temporal integration of favorable conditions
- Real COTS outbreaks typically follow 2-3 consecutive years of favorable conditions (warm, wet seasons with nutrient runoff)
- The current model responds instantaneously to environmental conditions without "memory"
- The exponential nutrient enhancement (exp(nutrient_effect_strength * positive_anomaly)) can grow unboundedly, which is ecologically unrealistic
- There's no mechanism to distinguish between a single favorable year vs. sustained favorable periods

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Literature on COTS outbreaks emphasizes that major population explosions require sustained favorable conditions:
1. Multiple larval cohorts from consecutive favorable years compound recruitment
2. Adult populations need time to build up reproductive capacity
3. There's a "priming" effect where the system becomes increasingly susceptible to outbreaks

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Cumulative Favorable Conditions Index
Add a dynamic state variable that tracks the accumulation of favorable environmental conditions over time:

- favorable_index(t) = favorable_index(t-1) * decay_rate + current_favorability
- decay_rate < 1.0 allows the index to decline during unfavorable periods
- current_favorability is a bounded measure (0-1) of how favorable current conditions are
- This index then modulates larval survival with a saturating response

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Replace unbounded exponential nutrient enhancement with bounded favorability metric
2. Add state variable for cumulative favorable conditions with decay
3. Use Hill function or similar saturating response to convert favorable_index to recruitment enhancement
4. This creates realistic threshold behavior: small favorable_index = minimal enhancement, high favorable_index = strong enhancement

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Better capture of outbreak timing (requires sustained favorable periods)
- More realistic boom-bust dynamics (outbreaks after multi-year buildup)
- Bounded, ecologically realistic enhancement of larval survival
- Improved prediction of outbreak magnitude and duration

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
- log_decay_favorable: Controls how quickly favorable conditions are "forgotten" (persistence timescale)
- log_threshold_favorable: Half-saturation constant for favorable conditions effect (outbreak sensitivity)
- max_enhancement: Maximum fold-increase in larval survival under optimal sustained conditions (bounded response)
