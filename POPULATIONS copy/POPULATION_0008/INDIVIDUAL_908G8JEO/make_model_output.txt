 • You mention a residuals file, but it was not included. Without it I cannot quantitatively assess fit quality or diagnose specific misfit patterns. If you can provide it, I’ll refine the assessment and validate the        
   proposed change.                                                                                                                                                                                                             

In the meantime, based on the model structure and project context, I propose one targeted ecological improvement and implement it below.                                                                                        

 1 Do we need code changes?                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Yes. To better capture the sharp boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks, I replaced the additive logistic density regulation for COTS with a Ricker-type overcompensatory growth step. This preserves the existing food,          
temperature, and Allee modifiers on rC but changes the population update to multiplicative exp growth with density feedback. This form is well-known to generate sharper peaks and crashes when rC and environmental drivers    
vary, aligning with the project goal to capture timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.                                                                                                                                   

 2 Explanation of changes                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 • Assessment (qualitative, pending residuals): The current model includes key mechanisms (selective predation on corals with a Type II/III response, temperature-driven bleaching suppressing coral growth, food- and          
   temperature-modulated COTS reproduction, Allee effect, and immigration). However, the COTS update uses additive logistic growth plus constant mortality, which tends to smooth dynamics and can under-represent abrupt       
   outbreak peaks and collapses.                                                                                                                                                                                                
 • Improvement: Switch to Ricker-style density regulation for COTS adults:                                                                                                                                                      
   C_next = C_prev * exp(rC * (1 - C_prev / Kc) - mC_base) + gamma_imm * immigration_t                                                                                                                                          
   This overcompensatory form is commonly used for outbreaking species and preserves positivity while allowing sharper post-peak declines. It uses only previous-step states and the exogenous drivers, thus avoiding data      
   leakage.

 +- T_bleach was updated from literature (31.75°C). The bleaching function is a logistic centered at T_bleach with slope bleach_slope, which remains appropriate. Given many GBR sites seldom reach such high SSTs, bleaching m 
 be occasional, which is consistent with the intended behavior.

 +Approach: Higher-order/non-linear density regulation for COTS adults via a Ricker-type update (overcompensatory growth).                                                                                                      
 +Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 +- Ricker dynamics are widely used for outbreaking species because they allow sharp increases when conditions are favorable and rapid declines after peak due to overcompensation.                                             
 +- The existing modifiers (food intake saturation, thermal performance, and Allee effect) remain intact and feed into rC. The change applies only to how rC is realized in population update.                                  
 +- This adds no new parameters or data requirements and avoids data leakage (relies only on prior state and exogenous drivers).
