Assessment and rationale

1) Model fit
- The residuals file was not provided here, so I cannot directly quantify fit. Structurally, the model likely captures declines in coral during high COTS density and under heat stress, and it can regulate COTS density via carrying capacity linked to coral cover. However, the timing and intermittency of COTS recruitment pulses—which are central to outbreak initiation—may be underrepresented if temperature alone does not produce sharp, episodic survival pulses in the available data.

2) Alignment with project context
- The context emphasizes accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of episodic COTS outbreaks, driven in part by selective predation on corals and environmental conditions that modulate larval survival. The current model includes selective predation and thermal stress on corals and a temperature-based larval survival filter with a pulse-sharpness exponent (alpha_larv). What is missing is an explicit (or latent) representation of unobserved environmental variability known to influence larval survival (e.g., nutrient/runoff driven productivity and plankton blooms), which is often crucial for triggering outbreaks.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Unobserved environmental variability affecting larval survival: absent.
- Adult mortality currently constant: acceptable for now, but could be extended later.
- Recruitment pulses rely solely on temperature via a Gaussian-shaped function; this may be too smooth to generate outbreak-like intermittency in some time series.

Chosen improvement: latent environmental pulse on larval survival (AR(1))

Ecological justification
- Empirical literature suggests that outbreaks are often initiated and sustained by episodic increases
