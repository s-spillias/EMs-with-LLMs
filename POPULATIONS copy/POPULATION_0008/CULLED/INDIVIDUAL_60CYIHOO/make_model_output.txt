 1 Do we need code changes?                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 2 What changes and why?                                                                                                                                                                                                        

 • Add an Allee effect on local COTS recruitment to represent density-dependent fertilization success. This is a key ecological mechanism for episodic outbreaks: at low adult densities, fertilization success is poor; once   
   density rises, recruitment increases sharply, enabling boom phases. The current model lacks this positive density dependence and uses only a trigger based on prey and immigration. Adding an Allee term improves            
   timing/magnitude realism without using current-time observations.                                                                                                                                                            
 • Implement the Allee effect only on local (food-driven) recruitment, not on immigration, to reflect that external larvae are not limited by local adult density.                                                              
 • Introduce one new parameter N_allee50 (ind/m2), the adult density yielding 50% fertilization success, using a quadratic Hill function f_allee = N^2 / (N^2 + N_allee50^2). This adds minimal complexity while capturing the  
   mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 • Update penalties and documentation accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                              
 • parameters.json updated to include N_allee50 with bounds and justification.                                                                                                                                                  
 • intention.txt updated with assessment of current structure, gaps, and rationale for the chosen improvement. Note: A residuals file was not provided; I included assumptions and asked to review residuals once available.

 +- Based on typical COTS dynamics, models without explicit positive density dependence in reproduction tend to (a) initiate outbreaks too easily at low densities or (b) mis-time peaks. The current structure uses an outbrea 
 trigger based on prey + immigration and temperature, but lacks local fertilization limitation.

 +- For episodic boom-bust cycles, a key mechanism is fertilization success increasing with adult density (Allee effect). This creates thresholds for rapid population takeoff and helps maintain realistic low-density phases  
 between outbreaks. This mechanism is currently missing.

 +- f_allee = N_prev^2 / (N_prev^2 + N_allee50^2), where N_prev is previous-year adult density and N_allee50 is the density at which fertilization success is 50%.                                                              
 +- Apply f_allee only to local (food-driven) recruitment rec_food; do NOT apply to immigration-driven recruitment rec_imm, as external larvae are not limited by local adult density.                                          
 +- Ecological justification: COTS are broadcast spawners; fertilization success increases steeply with local adult density (pairwise encounters imply ~quadratic scaling). This mechanism establishes a threshold for outbreak 
 onset and helps reproduce rapid boom and subsequent bust as prey is depleted.

 +- At low N_prev, recruitment is strongly suppressed, stabilizing low-density periods and reducing false outbreaks.                                                                                                            
 +- Once N_prev crosses ~N_allee50 (with sufficient prey and temperature), recruitment rapidly increases, enabling realistic boom dynamics.                                                                                     
 +- Peak magnitude and duration should be better governed by interaction of prey depletion (via consumption), negative density dependence (gamma_cots), and the new positive feedback.                                          
 +- Residuals should show improved timing and amplitude; please provide the residuals to verify and, if needed, tune N_allee50.

 +- r_cots (0.8 y^-1) and m_cots (0.6 y^-1) allow modest net growth before density dependence and triggers. gamma_cots (0.8) provides strong self-limitation at high densities.                                                 
 +- Feeding parameters (a_fast=2.0, a_slow=0.6; h_fast=0.5, h_slow=0.8) encode higher preference/efficiency on fast corals; consistent with empirical patterns.                                                                 
 +- K_total=0.8 caps total coral; logistic growth terms are temperature-modulated and likely adequate for this scope.                                                                                                           
 +- e_cons_to_rec, beta_imm, and K_imm remain initial estimates; with Allee in place, re-estimation may shift them downward because local recruitment is now throttled at low densities.

 +- N_allee50: lower_bound=0.01, upper_bound=10.0 ind/m2. This spans sparse to moderately high adult densities typical in reef surveys; estimation will identify site-specific thresholds.
