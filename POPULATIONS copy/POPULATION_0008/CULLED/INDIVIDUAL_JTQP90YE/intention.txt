Goal: Predict episodic Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) outbreaks (boom-bust cycles) on the Great Barrier Reef by coupling COTS population dynamics with fast- and slow-growing corals under environmental forcing (temperature) and external larval immigration.

Core mechanisms:
1) Food-limited, thermally-modified COTS growth with Allee effects and immigration pulses.
   - COTS population increases when per-capita intake of coral (especially fast-growing Acropora) is high.
   - A thermal performance curve modulates reproduction; very high or low SST depresses growth.
   - Mate limitation at low density (Allee effect) delays outbreak onset.
   - Dynamic carrying capacity depends on coral availability; when prey is depleted, COTS decline (bust).

2) Selective predation on corals via multi-prey functional response.
   - Holling-type saturation across fast vs slow corals captures preference and handling limits.
   - Predation uses a hazard formulation so removals never exceed available coral cover.

3) Coral dynamics with space limitation and bleaching stress.
   - Fast and slow corals grow logistically with Bevertonâ€“Holt style space limitation.
   - Elevated SST triggers bleaching: growth suppression and extra mortality (smooth, threshold-like).
   - Indirect feedback: high COTS predation reduces coral cover, which lowers COTS carrying capacity and food-driven reproduction, ending outbreaks.

4) Forcing inputs:
   - SST modifies COTS performance and coral bleaching.
   - External larval immigration seeds/extends outbreaks.

5) Statistical model:
   - COTS observations use a lognormal likelihood (strictly positive).
   - Coral observations (percent cover) use logit-normal likelihood on proportions.
   - Minimum observation SDs ensure numerical stability; all observations are included.

Initialization and prediction:
- Model states are initialized directly from the first observed values to avoid data leakage.
- All time-step predictions use only previous-step predictions and forcing inputs.
