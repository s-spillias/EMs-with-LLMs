Assessment and rationale

1) Fit to data
- A detailed residual evaluation is required to judge fit; however, a residuals file is not present in this chat. Please provide it for a thorough assessment (e.g., autocorrelation in COTS residuals around peaks, bias in outbreak amplitudes, and duration).
- From model structure alone, the likelihood is sensibly specified (lognormal for COTS, logit-normal for coral). SD floors are present to stabilize estimation.

2) Alignment with project context (episodic boom–bust outbreaks)
- The model contains several outbreak-enabling mechanics:
  • Recruitment pulses via a lagged thermal performance filter with sharpness (alpha_larv).
  • An Allee effect at low densities (A50).
  • Overcompensatory density dependence (theta_Ricker).
  • Food limitation via a saturating intake term (K_food) that feeds reproduction.
- These features help generate booms, but the “bust” duration could be overly long because adult mortality (mC_base) is constant and unaffected by food scarcity once coral is depleted. This can mute crash severity and extend tail persistence, potentially mismatching observed post-outbreak declines.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Starvation-driven adult mortality: Empirical and theoretical work suggests adult COTS survival declines when prey (live coral) is scarce. The current model represents food effects only on reproduction (rC) but not on adult mortality, which can bias the decline phase and prolong outbreaks.
- Other possible refinements (not implemented here to keep the change focused and identifiable): nonlinear Kc vs. coral cover, multi-year environmental memory for larval survival, or temperature effects on adult mortality.

Chosen improvement: Environmental modifier of adult mortality (food-dependent starvation)
- Ecological reasoning: After heavy predation and/or bleaching reduces coral cover, COTS should experience higher adult mortality due to starvation and predation risk. Incorporating food-dependent adult mortality accelerates and shortens busts, improving timing and duration of the outbreak cycle while remaining parsimonious.
- Mathematical form:
  • Let I_per_pred be the per-predator intake computed from t-1 states; define the saturating food index I_sat = I / (K_food + I) ∈ [0,1].
  • Effective adult mortality mC_eff = mC_base + mC_starv_max * (1 - I_sat).
  • Update equation (theta-Ricker) becomes:
      C_t = C_{t-1} * exp(rC * (1 - (C_{t-1}/Kc)^theta_C)) - mC_eff * C_{t-1} + gamma_imm * IMM_{t-1}.
- Properties:
  • No data leakage: I_sat uses only t-1 states (F_prev, S_prev, C_prev), consistent with existing code.
  • When food is abundant (I_sat ≈ 1), mC_eff ≈ mC_base; when food is scarce (I_sat ≈ 0), mC_eff increases up to mC_base + mC_starv_max.
  • This introduces a negative feedback that sharpens and shortens the post-peak decline consistent with observed boom–bust dynamics.

Review of parameter values and structural implications
- Topt was updated and bounds narrowed (28–29 °C). The Gaussian thermal performance with sigma_T remains appropriate; no scaling change is required.
- Existing parameters (K_food, epsilon_food) already structure food-limited reproduction; extending food influence to adult mortality is coherent and does not conflict with the current scaling.
- New parameter introduced:
  • mC_starv_max (year^-1): maximum additional adult mortality at minimal food. Suggested bounds [0.0, 3.0] year^-1 with initial value 1.0. This keeps mortality within biologically plausible annual rates while allowing the data to determine the strength of starvation-driven decline.

Implementation summary
- parameters.json: Added mC_starv_max with justification and bounds.
- model.cpp: Added PARAMETER(mC_starv_max), soft penalty bounds, and replaced constant adult mortality with food-modulated mC_eff in the COTS update step. All computations rely on previous-year states/drivers.
- No changes made to the observation model or coral dynamics to keep the intervention focused and to facilitate model comparison.

Next steps (once residuals are available)
- Check whether COTS residuals around peaks exhibit positive autocorrelation or prolonged positive bias (indicative of too-slow crashes). If yes, expect improvement with the new mortality term.
- Examine whether outbreak amplitudes or timing shift undesirably; adjust mC_starv_max bounds or consider a mild temperature interaction on mC_eff if warranted by residual patterns.
