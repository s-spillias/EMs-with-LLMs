Assessment and rationale for changes

Data fit:
- A residuals file was referenced but not provided in this context. Please supply it to enable a quantitative assessment of timing, magnitude, and duration errors. The model uses appropriate lognormal likelihoods and initializes states from t=0 observations, avoiding data leakage.

Project-context alignment:
- The current model includes mechanisms central to boom-bust COTS dynamics: prey-dependent survival, temperature-modulated reproduction, Allee effect on recruitment, prey-dependent recruitment saturation, preference-weighted multi-prey grazing, and temperature-driven bleaching impacts on coral.
- Gap: Adult COTS survival lacks environmental modulation from temperature extremes. Observed bust phases often coincide with heat-stress and bleaching years, when adult condition and survival drop rapidly. Without this, declines can be too gradual if prey remains available.

Parameter review:
- Topt_coral was updated from literature in parameters.json (value 29.5 °C; bounds 28–31 °C). The model’s soft-bound penalty previously allowed [20, 33] °C; this has been tightened to [28, 31] °C to reflect evidence-based constraints.

Chosen single ecological improvement:
- Approach: Environmental modifier of processes (adult survival).
- Change: Introduce a heat-stress penalty to adult COTS survival that leverages the existing bleaching logistic signal (bleach_level). Survival becomes:
  surv_t = s0_cots * (P/(K_prey + P))^theta_surv * exp(- m_heat_cots * bleach_level_t-1)
  where bleach_level_t-1 = logistic(k_bleach * (sst_t-1 - T_bleach)).
- Ecological justification: Warm-bleaching events reduce adult echinoderm performance and survival, and synergize with prey loss to abruptly end outbreaks. This addition sharpens bust termination timing without adding unnecessary state variables, and maintains no data leakage by using only lagged forcings.
- Complexity trade-off: Adds only one parameter (m_heat_cots). Reuses the existing bleaching signal to avoid duplicating temperature structures.

Implementation details:
- New parameter: m_heat_cots (units: yr^-1 equivalent coefficient). Bounds suggested: [0.0, 2.0]. Default value: 0.5 (initial estimate).
- Model code: Survival now multiplies prey-driven survival by exp(-m_heat_cots * bleach_level). Bounded within [0,1] via soft guards as before.
- Penalties: Added soft-bound penalty for m_heat_cots in model.cpp. Tightened soft bounds for Topt_coral to [28, 31] °C, consistent with parameters.json.

Anticipated residual patterns this addresses:
- If residuals show outbreaks ending too slowly (positive residuals during decline), the new survival penalty will steepen declines during warm years.
- If residuals show over-prediction of adult density during bleaching periods, this term will correct by lowering survival.
- If residuals show negligible improvement, m_heat_cots should shrink toward zero, preserving previous behavior.

Alternatives considered (not implemented to keep one targeted change):
- Temperature-dependent survival with a separate Gaussian performance curve (adds two parameters: Topt_cots_surv, sigmaT_cots_surv).
- Prey switching with a nonlinear exponent (q) on preference-weighted availability to intensify focus on Acropora when abundant.
- Cyclone disturbance or cold-stress mortality terms. These require additional forcings not provided here.

Next steps:
- Please provide the residuals file to verify that the modification improves outbreak termination timing and reduces systematic biases. If residuals point to prey-switching or nutrient-pulse-driven recruitment as the dominant misfit, we can pivot to those mechanisms in a subsequent iteration.
