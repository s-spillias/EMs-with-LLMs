Assessment and fit:
- Data fit: A formal residual-based evaluation is pending (residuals file not provided here). Structurally, the model is capable of producing boom-bust cycles via food- and temperature-modulated recruitment, Allee effects, and density regulation. However, a single 1-year lag on the recruitment driver likely smooths outbreak timing and can bias peaks (too early/too low), a common pattern when maturation delays are longer than one year.
- Alignment with project context: The model captures selective predation on fast (Acropora) and slow (Faviidae/Porites) corals, and includes immigration pulses and temperature effects on reproduction. These mechanisms support outbreak initiation and termination, broadly matching the GBR boom-bust narrative.
- Potentially missing/oversimplified processes:
  1) Juvenile maturation delay (cryptic juvenile phase of 1–3 years) is approximated with a single-year lag blend; this can under-represent episodic pulses.
  2) Outbreak crash processes (density-elevated mortality via disease/predation) are constant (mC_base), which may limit sharp crash dynamics.
  3) Watershed/runoff or nutrient-driven larval survival pulses are not explicitly modeled (only temperature is included).
  4) Stage structure is collapsed; while acceptable for parsimony, it limits cohort effects.

Parameter review:
- Topt is flagged updated_from_literature with value 29 and bounds [28, 30]. The model’s soft penalty used [24, 31], which is broader than the literature update.
- Other parameters are plausible with ranges consistent with parameters.json.

Chosen improvement (one change):
- Introduce a two-lag distributed delay for the recruitment driver (food × temperature) to reflect 1–2 year juvenile maturation. We keep the existing lag_recruit as the total lag weight (0–1) and add lag2_share (0–1) to split the total lag between t-1 and t-2:
  - w0 = 1 − lag_recruit (immediate year t)
  - w1 = lag_recruit × (1 − lag2_share) (lagged by 1 year)
  - w2 = lag_recruit × lag2_share (lagged by 2 years)
- This preserves parsimony, avoids data leakage, and better captures episodic dynamics without introducing stage-structured states.
- Also align Topt’s soft penalty bounds in model.cpp to [28, 30] to match parameters.json.

Equation changes:
- Replace the current one-lag mixture in the COTS per-capita growth rate with a two-lag mixture:
  food_temp_mix = w0 * (I_sat_t * T_perf_t) + w1 * (I_sat_{t-1} * T_perf_{t-1}) + w2 * (I_sat_{t-2} * T_perf_{t-2})
- Maintain all other structures (functional response, bleaching, density regulation).
- Initialize the lag buffers from t=0 (prev1 and prev2 seeded to the same t=0 value).

Ecological justification:
- COTS juveniles typically require >1 year to mature from settlement to detectable corallivory, so recruitment pulses manifest with delays of 1–3 years. A two-lag distributed delay is a minimal-complexity way to reflect this life-history feature and generate sharper, episodic outbreaks in timing and magnitude.

Notes:
- No current-time observations (…_dat) are used in prediction updates; only prior states and current exogenous drivers (SST, immigration) are used. Initial conditions continue to be seeded from t=0 observations, as before.
- Future improvements (not implemented here): density-elevated mortality during outbreaks, runoff/nutrient covariates for larval survival, or explicit stage structure.
