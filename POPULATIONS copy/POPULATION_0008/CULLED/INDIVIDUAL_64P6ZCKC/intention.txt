Assessment and rationale

Fit and context alignment:
- Without the residuals file, a quantitative fit assessment is not possible here. Structurally, the model is well-aligned with key processes (selective predation on fast/slow corals, temperature-driven bleaching affecting coral, lagged temperature effects on larval survival, Allee effects, coral-dependent carrying capacity, and immigration).
- For the PROJECT CONTEXT (episodic outbreaks), the current logistic-type density regulation can under-represent sharp post-peak collapses and may smooth outbreak peaks, leading to potential residual patterns of underpredicted peaks and overly gradual declines.

Potential missing or oversimplified mechanisms:
- Overcompensatory density dependence in COTS (e.g., crowding-induced disease, settlement interference) that accelerates post-peak declines.
- External larval food pulses (eutrophication/runoff) are not represented due to lack of a nutrient/chl-a driver in the provided data.
- Predator feedbacks on COTS and stage structure are not explicitly modeled (kept out to preserve parsimony).
- Additional starvation mortality beyond logistic regulation could be considered but would increase parameterization.

Chosen improvement: theta-Ricker density regulation for COTS
- Ecological motivation: Many outbreaking populations exhibit overcompensatory dynamics. A theta-Ricker form enables sharp boom-bust cycles by making growth highly sensitive to high densities.
- Mathematical change:
  C_t = C_{t-1} * exp(rC * (1 - (C_{t-1}/Kc)^theta_C)) - mC_base * C_{t-1} + gamma_imm * immigration_{t-1}
  where rC already incorporates food limitation (I_sat), lagged thermal performance (T_pulse), and Allee effects.
- Expected impact: Improved ability to match timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak peaks and subsequent crashes without depending on unobserved drivers. Maintains coral feedback via Kc(F,S) and preserves existing observation models and stability safeguards.

Parameter updates:
- Added theta_C (dimensionless; bounds 0.5â€“5.0). Initial value 1.5 allows moderate overcompensation; 1.0 reverts to standard Ricker. Bound penalties included to keep ecological plausibility.

Data leakage safeguard:
- Predictions continue to use only previous time-step states (and lagged forcing). No current observations are used in process equations.

Next steps:
- Refit and inspect residuals for (i) peak alignment, (ii) post-peak decay rate, and (iii) any systematic bias at low densities. Adjust theta_C bounds if needed and consider adding density-dependent disease mortality only if warranted by residual structure.
