Assessment and fit:
- Data fit: A residuals file was referenced but not provided here, so I cannot quantify fit. Please supply the residuals to examine bias patterns (e.g., outbreak timing, amplitude, duration).
- Structural adequacy: The model includes key elements for boom-bust dynamics: food-limited reproduction, Gaussian thermal performance, Allee effect at low density, and carrying capacity tied to coral cover. Coral dynamics include predation with a flexible (Type II–III) functional response and bleaching mortality.
- Potential issues: Recruitment currently responds within the same annual step to adult feeding and temperature. Given COTS maturation and larval survival processes, outbreaks typically express after a delay. Immediate feedback can suppress oscillations or misalign outbreak timing. Parameter penalties for T_bleach and mC_base in code did not reflect updated literature bounds in parameters.json, risking biased estimation.

Missing/oversimplified processes:
- Maturation/recruitment delay: COTS reach reproductive size after ~1 year+, and larval survival to settlement depends on prior-year conditions (e.g., nutrients, temperature). This delay is a common driver for episodic outbreaks and cohort-driven pulses.

Chosen improvement (environmental modifier with lag blending):
- Add a lag-blended recruitment driver for COTS. Define phi_lag in [0,1] to blend current and previous year’s reproductive conditions (food intake and temperature):
  repro_index = (1 - phi_lag) * (I_sat(t) * T_perf(t)) + phi_lag * (I_sat(t-1) * T_perf(t-1))
  rC = rC_max * epsilon_food * repro_index * Allee_m
- This maintains differentiability and lets the data infer how delayed recruitment is, from no lag (phi_lag=0) to fully lagged (phi_lag=1). It is consistent with ecological understanding of delayed maturation/settlement and helps generate realistic boom-bust cycles and outbreak timing.

Other code adjustments:
- Align smooth penalty bounds with literature-updated parameters:
  - T_bleach bounds updated to [29.0, 34.5]
  - mC_base bounds updated to [0.0013, 2.56]
- No data leakage introduced: predictions use previous time-step states only; exogenous SST and immigration are allowed at time t; the lagged terms use t-0 states and t-1 SST only.

Implications and next steps:
- After refitting, inspect residuals for outbreak onset and decay timing. If outbreaks remain too smooth, consider a two-year distributed delay (e.g., second lag with its own weight) or stage structure. If amplitudes are too high, tighten food half-saturation or increase density dependence in Kc linkage. If coral decline is too slow during outbreaks, re-examine handling times and q_func.
- Please share the residuals to verify whether this change reduces phase-lag bias and captures pulse magnitude and duration.
