Assessment of current model and parameters, and rationale for proposed change

1) Fit to data
- The residuals file was not provided in this chat, so I could not compute quantitative diagnostics (bias, autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity).
- The likelihood structure (lognormal for COTS densities; logit-normal for coral proportions) is appropriate and numerically stable (soft floors on SDs, safe-logit), so mismatches are likely structural rather than statistical.
- The current process model should be able to produce boom–bust cycles via: (i) food limitation and saturating per-predator intake, (ii) Allee effects at low densities, and (iii) carrying capacity linked to coral cover. However, the timing of booms is primarily governed by a single 1-year lag in the recruitment driver, which may be too narrow to match observed outbreak periodicity and propagation.

2) Alignment with project context
- The model captures selective predation on fast (Acropora) vs slow (Faviidae/Porites) coral using a multi-prey functional response with adjustable exponent (Type II–III), which is suitable.
- Temperature modifies coral mortality and growth (bleaching), and COTS reproduction is modulated by food (coral availability) and thermal performance—also suitable.
- A key driver emphasized in the outbreak literature—the multi-year cryptic juvenile phase (roughly 1–3 years to maturation)—is currently simplified to a single 1-year lag. This simplification can shift or compress the timing of predicted outbreaks, reducing realism for episodic, wave-like dynamics.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Juvenile maturation delay distribution: The one-parameter lag (lag_recruit) only allows mixing of t and t-1 signals. Empirical evidence suggests recruitment strength reflects favorable food–temperature conditions integrated over 1–3 previous years. Without a distributed lag, the model may miss outbreak timing and duration.
- Collapse mechanisms at high COTS densities (e.g., disease/starvation): The model uses a constant mortality mC_base. While a food-dependent mortality could steepen busts, it risks identifiability issues without additional data.
- Nutrient/Chl-a pulses: Often implicated in triggering outbreaks via larval survival, but no such covariate is available here.

Review of parameters
- All parameters in parameters.json have updated_from_literature=false. No evidence of recent literature-driven replacements was provided. Bounds look reasonable and consistent with the current functional forms.
- If future literature updates substantially modify typical magnitudes (e.g., raising rC_max or changing thermal breadth), we should revisit scaling in the recruitment function to preserve interpretability and parameter identifiability.

Chosen ecological improvement: 0–2 year distributed recruitment lag
- Mechanism: Introduce a 3-term maturation kernel over current year, 1-year, and 2-year lagged food–temperature drivers. This encodes juvenile cryptic phase duration (1–3 years) in a simple, identifiable way, improving outbreak timing without adding new data or complex state structure.
- Mathematics: We retain lag_recruit∈[0,1] and add lag2_recruit∈[0,1]. Define weights:
    w2 = lag2_recruit
    w1 = lag_recruit * (1 - w2)
    w0 = 1 - w1 - w2 = (1 - lag2_recruit) * (1 - lag_recruit)
  The recruitment driver becomes: food_temp_mix = w0*FT_t + w1*FT_{t-1} + w2*FT_{t-2}, where FT_t = I_sat_t * T_perf_t.
- Expected effect: Broader and delayed recruitment response improves the model’s ability to reproduce episodic booms with more realistic timing and duration, and better captures multi-year outbreak waves seen on the GBR.
- Identifiability note: The new lag weight lag2_recruit trades off with lag_recruit but within a simplex (weights sum to 1), which helps identifiability. rC_max and epsilon_food remain interpretable as scaling terms.

Data leakage policy
- The modification uses only lagged model states (F,S,C) and exogenous drivers at time t (SST, immigration). It does not use the current step’s observed response variables (cots_dat, fast_dat, slow_dat) in prediction.

Next steps (optional if residuals become available)
- Re-examine residual autocorrelation of COTS after fitting this change; a reduction would indicate improved outbreak timing. If issues persist, consider adding a food-dependent mortality term or a nutrient proxy covariate if available.
