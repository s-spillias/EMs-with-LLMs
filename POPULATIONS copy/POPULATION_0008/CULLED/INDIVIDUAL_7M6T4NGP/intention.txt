Assessment and rationale for improvement

1) Fit to data (needs residuals)
- The residuals file was not provided here, so I cannot compute or summarize actual fit quality. In similar COTS systems, common issues include:
  - Peak under/overestimation (timing and magnitude),
  - Declines too slow after peaks (insufficiently sharp busts),
  - Coral composition misfit around outbreak phases.
- Please share residuals so we can verify whether the added mechanism reduces any observed slow-crash bias and improves peak/bust timing.

2) Alignment with the project context
- The current model incorporates key features:
  - Selective predation on fast (Acropora) and slow (Faviidae/Porites) coral via a multi-prey functional response with handling time and a Type II/III exponent.
  - Coral growth with space limitation, background and bleaching mortality.
  - COTS recruitment driven by food (per-predator intake) and temperature with an Allee effect, plus immigration and a one-year lag blend.
  - Carrying capacity linked to coral cover (Kc increases with coral).
- This structure is appropriate for generating boom-bust cycles. However, the bust phase is primarily driven by reduced growth via carrying capacity and baseline mortality, which can produce declines that are too gradual when prey is depleted.

3) Missing/oversimplified processes
- Starvation/disease mortality during low-food periods is not explicitly modeled. Empirically, after outbreak peaks, rapid busts often follow coral depletion due to starvation and disease.
- Recruitment delay may be longer than one year; a distributed lag could be considered in future iterations if residuals indicate timing issues.
- Consistency: Topt literature bounds in parameters.json (28–30 °C) were not fully reflected in model.cpp penalty bounds; this has been aligned.

Chosen single ecological improvement

Mechanism: Food-limitation-driven additional mortality for COTS
- Add an extra mortality term that increases as per-predator intake saturation (I_sat) declines.
- Mathematical representation:
  mC_extra = mC_starve_max * (max(eps, 1 - I_sat))^theta_starve
  mC_eff   = mC_base + mC_extra
  C_next   = C_prev + deltaC - mC_eff * C_prev + gamma_imm * IMM_t
- Where I_sat is the existing saturating food index used in reproduction (0..1). This uses predicted states only (no data leakage), is AD-safe, and introduces minimal complexity while targeting the observed ecology of sharp post-peak collapses.

Expected impacts
- Stronger, earlier busts after peaks when coral has been heavily consumed (I_sat low), improving timing and magnitude of declines.
- Retains outbreak triggers (food + temperature + Allee) and existing density regulation; adds a realistic feedback for crash dynamics without new data requirements.

Parameter changes
- Added:
  - mC_starve_max (year^-1): Maximum added mortality at zero intake. Bounds: [0.0, 5.0].
  - theta_starve (dimensionless): Curvature/sensitivity to food shortage; theta ≥ 0.5 allows sub- to super-linear responses. Bounds: [0.5, 5.0].
- Synced model.cpp penalty bounds for Topt to [28.0, 30.0] to match parameters.json (literature-updated).

Validation next steps
- With residuals: check whether peak overshoot and slow-crash biases are reduced; inspect residual ACF, phase alignment of peaks/busts, and coral composition fit. If timing remains off, consider a distributed multi-year recruitment lag in a subsequent iteration.
