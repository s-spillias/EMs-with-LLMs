I understand the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 1 Are code changes needed?                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Yes. To better capture the bust phase of outbreaks and improve ecological realism, I’m adding a saturating density-dependent mortality term for COTS. This represents increased predation/disease/cannibalism when COTS         
densities are high, which sharpens the decline after peaks and supports boom-bust dynamics without requiring new external drivers.                                                                                              

 2 Summary of changes                                                                                                                                                                                                           

 • Model: Add an endogenous mortality term mC_dd(C) = mC_dd_max * C / (Kc_dd + C), applied to the COTS population in addition to baseline mortality. This creates stronger, saturating negative feedback at high density,       
   improving the timing and magnitude of declines following outbreaks.

 +- Rationale: Outbreak declines are often steeper than predicted by baseline mortality and Ricker-only regulation. Processes such as predator aggregation, disease spread, and cannibalism intensify with COTS density and     
 saturate at high levels. A Holling type-II-like mortality increment captures this negative feedback without requiring new external data.
