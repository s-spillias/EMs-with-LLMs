 +- A residuals file was referenced but not provided here. Without it, I cannot quantitatively assess fit (biases, autocorrelation, peak under/overshoot). Please share the residuals to validate these points.                 
 +- Structurally, the COTS demographic core uses an additive logistic increment (deltaC = rC * C * (1 - C/Kc) - mC_base * C), which tends to produce smooth approach to carrying capacity and relatively muted declines. This   
 formulation can struggle to reproduce sharp boom-bust cycles typical of episodic COTS outbreaks unless rC varies extremely over time.

 +- Strengths: The model already includes selective predation on fast/slow coral via a multi-prey Holling response (with Type III option via q), Allee effects on COTS, temperature effects on both corals and COTS, and        
 immigration pulses.

 +  a) Overcompensation/boom-bust dynamics: Additive logistic growth for COTS generally underrepresents the rapid ascent to outbreak levels and sharp post-peak crashes that are characteristic in the field.                   
 +  b) Mortality feedbacks: Declines are controlled by mC_base and density limitation through Kc(Coral), but this often yields gradual declines rather than abrupt busts unless mC_base is very high.                           
 +  c) Recruitment pulse drivers (nutrient/larval survival) are not explicit; immigration provides pulses but may not be sufficient to reproduce the internal boom-bust dynamics.

 +- Stage structure (cryptic juveniles) and nutrient-driven larval survival pulses are not included; both can sharpen outbreak timing and amplitude.                                                                            
 +- Strong density-dependent mortality/disease at high COTS density is not explicit (beyond logistic limitation).                                                                                                               
 +- The demographic core uses an additive logistic increment instead of a multiplicative (discrete-time) stock-recruit form (e.g., Ricker), which is commonly used to reproduce oscillatory and outbreak dynamics.              
 +

 +- With current defaults, the maximum per-capita reproductive term may be too low to overcome baseline mortality:                                                                                                              
 +  rC_max = 3.0, epsilon_food = 0.4 → rC ≤ 1.2 at best (before temperature, Allee, food saturation multipliers). mC_base = 1.28065. Thus, even under ideal conditions, rC - mC_base < 0, implying declines without strong      
 immigration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 +- This does not require an immediate parameter change here, but during estimation the optimizer will likely push rC_max upward and/or epsilon_food upward (or reduce mC_base) to allow outbreaks. If the residuals confirm    
 persistent underprediction of outbreaks, consider relaxing epsilon_food’s upper bound (>1) or revisiting mC_base’s central tendency.

 +Chosen improvement: Switch COTS demographic core from additive logistic increment to a Ricker-type multiplicative update

 +  a) Ecological: COTS populations exhibit rapid increases and sharp declines (overcompensation) that are better captured by discrete-time multiplicative processes (Ricker) than by additive logistic increments.             
 +  b) Mathematical: The Ricker form N_{t+1} = N_t * exp(r_eff * (1 - N_t/K)) can generate pulses/oscillations when r_eff is large and supports boom-bust cycles without introducing new parameters.                            
 +  c) Minimal complexity: This targets the demographic nonlinearity with a single structural adjustment and no new parameters, preserving identifiability.
