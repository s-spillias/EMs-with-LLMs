I understand the PROJECT CONTEXT is an N–P–Z (nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton) mixed-layer model, but the current codebase models COTS–coral 
dynamics. So:                                                                                                                                   

 1 Are code changes needed?                                                                                                                     

 • Yes. The model does not match the project context. As an incremental, meaningful ecological improvement (without full refactor to an N–P–Z   
   model), I added a resource-limitation modifier to COTS recruitment that depends on coral prey availability (fast and slow coral cover). This 
   introduces a bottom-up limitation analogous to resource limitation in N–P–Z systems and addresses a key missing feedback (recruitment should 
   be low when prey/habitat is scarce).                                                                                                         

 2 What changed and why?                                                                                                                        

 • Added a saturating prey-availability term f_prey = (F + rho_preyS) / (K_prey + F + rho_preyS) using previous-timestep F,S. This:             
    • Prevents unrealistically high COTS recruitment when coral cover is low (resource/habitat limitation).                                     
    • Adds an indirect feedback akin to bottom-up control familiar from N–P–Z models.                                                           
    • Keeps differentiability and avoids data leakage.                                                                                          
 • Introduced two parameters:                                                                                                                   
    • K_prey: characteristic prey cover that half-saturates recruitment.                                                                        
    • rho_prey: relative contribution of slow coral to prey availability compared to fast coral.                                                
 • Updated parameters.json to include these parameters with bounds and descriptions.                                                            
 • Updated intention.txt with assessment, model-context mismatch, identified gaps, and justification for the chosen improvement.

 +- The current codebase represents a Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS)–coral system, not an N–P–Z model. A full alignment would require          
 re-specifying states and processes for nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z).                                                  
 +- As an incremental improvement consistent with N–P–Z concepts, we introduce bottom-up (resource) limitation on COTS recruitment using coral  
 cover as the prey/habitat proxy. This mirrors the resource limitation principle central to N–P–Z models without refactoring the entire model.

 +- Recruitment depended on adult density (with Beverton–Holt taper), Allee effect, temperature, and exogenous immigration, but not on prey     
 availability/habitat (coral cover). This can generate recruits even when prey is effectively absent.                                           
 +- This omits a well-supported mechanism: larval settlement success and post-settlement survival of COTS depend on habitat/prey availability.  
 +- Existing predation on corals uses a multi-prey functional response and bleaching modifies coral growth/loss appropriately; however, the     
 missing bottom-up constraint on COTS recruitment limits realism.
