Assessment and rationale

Fit to data
- Residuals file not provided in the current context, so a quantitative assessment of fit (bias, autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity) cannot be performed here. Please provide residuals or summary diagnostics to verify impacts post-change.
- Qualitatively, outbreak-style recruitment in the current model can be too permissive: recruitment can remain high even when coral prey/habitat is scarce, which often leads to overpredicted COTS persistence/outbreaks following severe coral loss.

Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT (N–P–Z mixed-layer model)
- The current codebase represents a Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS)–coral system, not an N–P–Z model. A full alignment would require re-specifying states and processes for nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z).
- As an incremental improvement consistent with N–P–Z concepts, we introduce bottom-up (resource) limitation on COTS recruitment using coral cover as the prey/habitat proxy. This mirrors the resource limitation principle central to N–P–Z models without refactoring the entire model.

Key ecological processes missing/oversimplified (prior model)
- Recruitment depended on adult density (with Beverton–Holt taper), Allee effect, temperature, and exogenous immigration, but not on prey availability/habitat (coral cover). This can generate recruits even when prey is effectively absent.
- This omits a well-supported mechanism: larval settlement success and post-settlement survival of COTS depend on habitat/prey availability.
- Existing predation on corals uses a multi-prey functional response and bleaching modifies coral growth/loss appropriately; however, the missing bottom-up constraint on COTS recruitment limits realism.

Chosen improvement: resource-limited COTS recruitment
- We multiply recruitment by a saturating prey-availability term using previous-timestep coral cover:
  f_prey = (F + rho_prey * S) / (K_prey + F + rho_prey * S)
  where F,S are fast/slow coral cover (%).
- Ecological justification:
  - Captures habitat/prey limitation on recruitment and early survival.
  - Prevents unrealistic outbreaks when coral cover is low.
  - Introduces an indirect negative feedback: heavy COTS predation lowers coral, which then suppresses future recruitment, improving stability and realism.
- Mathematical properties:
  - Bounded in [0,1], smooth, and increasing with coral cover.
  - Uses only previous-timestep F,S, avoiding data leakage.
- New parameters:
  - K_prey (% cover scale): half-saturation level for the prey effect. Suggested bounds 1–100%.
  - rho_prey (0–1): relative contribution weight of slow coral vs fast coral to recruitment limitation.
- Expected effects on residuals:
  - Reduce positive residuals (overprediction) for COTS following periods of low coral cover.
  - Potentially reduce temporal autocorrelation in COTS residuals by introducing a stabilizing feedback.

Notes and next steps
- To fully meet the N–P–Z project scope, consider a separate refactor to explicit N,P,Z state equations (e.g., Monod uptake, grazing with Holling functional response, nutrient recycling).
- After running the updated model, please share residuals/diagnostics to evaluate whether additional structure (e.g., variable efficiency terms or environmental modulation of mortality) is warranted.
