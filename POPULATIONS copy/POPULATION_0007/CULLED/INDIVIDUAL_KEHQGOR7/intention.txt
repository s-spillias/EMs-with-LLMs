Assessment summary

Fit to data:
- Residuals file was not included in the provided files, so I could not quantitatively assess fit or patterns (bias, variance, autocorrelation). The analysis below is structural and based on expected behavior of outbreak systems. Please provide residuals to refine this assessment.

How the current model addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Outbreak triggers and boom phase: Positive feedbacks in recruitment via adult density (C^phi) and a smooth Allee effect, plus temperature-modulated recruitment, can create rapid increases. Immigration forcing (cotsimm_dat) can seed events.
- Bust phase: Density-dependent adult mortality (gammaC*C^2) provides a mechanism for post-peak declines.
- Coral impacts: A multi-prey Holling II/III blend with separate fast/slow coral terms captures selective predation pressure, and bleaching reduces coral growth above a temperature threshold.
- Environmental drivers: Gaussian SST effect on recruitment and temperature-dependent coral growth/bleaching represent key thermal controls.

Potential shortcomings relative to the context:
- Missing prey-dependent starvation feedback on adults: When coral is depleted during an outbreak, adults should experience elevated mortality/starvation; current mortality is only baseline + density dependent in COTS themselves. This can delay or understate busts and allow unrealistically high predator persistence at low coral cover.
- Recruitment resource term: Recruitment currently scales with a coral “resource index” (wF*F + wS*S). Empirically, larval survival is more tied to nutrient pulses (e.g., flood-driven phytoplankton) rather than live coral cover, while settlement substrate availability may depend on free space. This coupling may misattribute recruitment variation to coral cover. However, I am not changing this term here to keep one focused improvement.
- External nutrient pulses: No explicit exogenous pulse to recruitment beyond cotsimm_dat. If residuals show clustered underprediction during known flood years, adding a nutrient covariate would be warranted.
- Stage structure: A single juvenile pool with constant mJ and muJ may be oversimplified given ontogenetic diet shifts; acceptable for now.

Parameter review highlights:
- T_opt_bleach was updated from literature (value 32.65°C with refined bounds). The current heat-stress growth multiplier exp(-beta_bleach * temp_excess) remains structurally consistent with this update.
- Other parameters are initial estimates and broad-bounded. Particularly phi, gammaC, mJ, muJ govern outbreak amplification/damping; they remain flexible for estimation.

Chosen improvement: prey-dependent starvation mortality for adult COTS

Ecological rationale:
- During outbreaks, COTS rapidly deplete preferred coral prey, after which adult survival declines due to starvation and increased susceptibility to predation/disease. Introducing a coral-dependent mortality term produces sharper, more realistic busts and helps match observed timing and duration of declines once coral falls below a threshold.

Mathematical form (added terms):
- Let TCor_prev = F_prev + S_prev be total coral cover (%) at t-1.
- Starvation signal (smooth logistic rising as coral declines below a threshold):
  starv_frac = 1 / (1 + exp(-k_starv * (K_starv - TCor_prev)))
  where:
  - K_starv (% cover) is the mid-point threshold where starvation risk is 50%.
  - k_starv (%^-1) controls steepness.
- Additional adult mortality rate:
  mu_starv = m_starv * starv_frac  [yr^-1]
- Adult mortality updated to:
  Mort_adult = (muC + mu_starv + gammaC * C_prev) * C_prev

Why this improves outbreak dynamics:
- Triggers busts when prey is exhausted, preventing prolonged high predator densities under low coral cover.
- Couples predator dynamics to their resource base, a key feedback consistent with observed outbreak collapses.
- Retains smooth differentiability and avoids data leakage by using t-1 states only.

Parameterization and bounds (added):
- K_starv (% cover): lower_bound 5.0, upper_bound 70.0
- k_starv (%^-1): lower_bound 0.01, upper_bound 1.0
- m_starv (yr^-1): lower_bound 0.0, upper_bound 2.0

Implementation notes:
- Added three new parameters (K_starv, k_starv, m_starv), smooth penalties for broad plausible ranges, and diagnostics to report starv_frac and mu_starv time series.
- No current-time observations are used in predictions; only t-1 state variables drive transitions.

Next steps once residuals are available:
- Inspect whether residuals during peak and post-peak periods shrink and lose positive autocorrelation with this feedback.
- If early boom timing is still off, consider adding an exogenous nutrient (flood/chl-a) covariate to recruitment or a saturating stock-recruitment form to avoid runaway dynamics without pulses.
