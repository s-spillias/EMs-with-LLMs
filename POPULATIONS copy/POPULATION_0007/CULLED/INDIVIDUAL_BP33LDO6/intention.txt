Assessment summary
- Data fit: The residuals file was not provided in the chat, so I cannot quantify fit. Based on structure, the recruitment pathway is smooth and memoryless aside from adult density and temperature. This often underestimates outbreak sharpness and can misalign peak timing and amplitude.
- Project alignment: The model includes Allee effects, resource limitation via coral, temperature modifiers for recruitment and bleaching, density-dependent adult mortality, and a multi-prey functional response. These are appropriate for COTS boom–bust dynamics. However, episodic outbreaks in COTS are strongly influenced by multi-year maturation delays and intermittent high larval survival episodes. The current single juvenile pool with fractional maturation (mJ) can under-represent the typical 2–3 year lag between larval pulses and adult outbreaks.
- Potentially missing or simplified processes:
  - Multi-year maturation delay (age/stage structure) is simplified to one stock.
  - Episodic larval survival drivers (e.g., runoff- or chl-a-driven pulses) are not represented. Adding a covariate or random-effects process would be a future enhancement if supported by data.

Review of parameters
- T_opt_bleach has updated literature support; current bleaching representation combines a multiplicative growth reduction and an additional linear loss per °C above threshold. While this doubles the thermal penalty, it is biologically plausible if beta_bleach primarily reduces net growth and m_bleach terms capture acute mortality. No structural change required at this stage.
- Other parameters (alpha_rec, phi, k_allee, etc.) remain initial estimates with plausible bounds and weak range penalties. No parameter bounds appear to force implausible behavior.
- mJ and muJ ranges are reasonable for annual rates. However, a single juvenile compartment likely smooths cohort dynamics too much to replicate observed lagged adult peaks.

Chosen improvement: two-stage juvenile structure
- Rationale: COTS typically mature over ~2–3 years. Representing juveniles with two sequential stages (J1 then J2) introduces a gamma-like maturation delay without adding new parameters. Adults recruit only from J2, creating a realistic lag and sharper outbreaks when recruitment pulses occur.
- Implementation:
  - Replace the single juvenile stock with two compartments J1 and J2.
  - Rec_in (larval input) enters J1.
  - J1 progresses to J2 at rate mJ; J2 progresses to adults at rate mJ; both stages experience juvenile mortality muJ.
  - Adults: C_t = C + mJ*J2 - Mort.
  - J2_t = (1 - mJ - muJ)*J2 + mJ*J1; J1_t = (1 - mJ - muJ)*J1 + Rec_in; all transitions wrapped in smooth pospart to prevent negatives.
- Expected effect on fit and dynamics:
  - Produces 1–2 year lag between recruitment pulses and adult peaks, improving outbreak timing.
  - Sharper, higher adult peaks for the same recruitment pulses, helping match peak amplitude.
  - Retains existing Allee, resource, and temperature controls on recruitment; no new data required.

Next steps after residuals review (not implemented here)
- If residuals indicate systematic underprediction preceding observed peaks, add an environmental recruitment multiplier (e.g., runoff/chl-a or a latent AR(1) process) to capture episodic larval survival.
- If coral loss during heatwaves is still underpredicted, consider adjusting the balance between beta_bleach (growth suppression) and m_bleach terms (acute loss), or allow taxon-specific heat multipliers.

Data leakage
- All prediction updates use only previous-step states and covariates; observation vectors are not used contemporaneously in process equations.

Interface/outputs
- Both juvenile stages (juv1_pred, juv2_pred) are reported, along with juv_pred = juv1 + juv2 for backward compatibility with previous outputs.
