ASSESSMENT

1) Model fit to data
- Residuals: A residuals file was referenced but not provided here, so I cannot quantitatively assess fit. Please share the residuals to confirm the specific misfit patterns (timing, magnitude, duration) across COTS, fast coral, and slow coral.
- Structural expectations: The current structure should capture broad boom-bust cycles via (i) recruitment amplification (alpha_rec, phi, Allee), (ii) larval resource dependence (K_R, wF, wS), (iii) density-dependent adult mortality (gammaC), and (iv) coral depletion through feeding and bleaching. However, without a starvation/food-limitation mechanism for adult COTS, busts may be too weak or delayed after coral has been heavily consumed/bleached, which often appears in residuals as over-prediction of adult COTS during the bust phase.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model includes key outbreak triggers: positive recruitment feedbacks (phi > 1 and Allee), larval resource limitation (R/(K_R+R)), and temperature-modified recruitment.
- It captures selective predation through prey-specific parameters (aF, aS, etaF, etaS, qF, qS), and coral thermal stress via T_opt_bleach with both growth suppression and extra losses m_bleachF/S.
- Gap with context: Empirically, adult COTS rapidly decline once coral cover is depleted (starvation or dispersal). The current adult mortality is baseline plus density dependence in C (muC + gammaC*C). It does not increase mortality when prey availability is low. This can mute or delay busts and weaken outbreak termination.

3) Processes potentially missing or oversimplified
- Missing adult food-limitation mortality: No explicit mortality increase at low coral resource. This is a key mechanism for abrupt post-outbreak declines.
- Recruitment environment pulses: Only SST affects recruitment; other environmental drivers (e.g., nutrient/runoff pulses) are not represented. There is an immigration input, but no stochastic or environmental multiplier.
- Predator control or removal: Not currently represented (potentially acceptable if data do not constrain it).
- Preference plasticity: Attack/handling are static; could be temperature-dependent, but this is secondary to getting busts right.

Parameter review
- T_opt_bleach has updated literature-derived value (33.02 °C; lower bound 31.74 °C). The heat-stress module (growth reduction and linear additional losses with temperature excess) remains mechanistically appropriate; no structural change is required for that update.
- Many other parameters are initial estimates. Given the project focus on outbreak termination, the absence of an adult starvation term is the most impactful structural omission.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT

Add adult food-limitation (starvation) mortality that increases smoothly when coral resource is low.

Rationale
- Empirical outbreaks end abruptly as food is depleted; adults exhibit high mortality/starvation or emigration. A resource-dependent mortality term provides a strong, biologically grounded negative feedback that accelerates busts after heavy coral loss, improving timing and magnitude of declines.
- This is a minimal structural change leveraging existing resource index R = wF*F + wS*S and does not introduce data leakage.

Formulation
- Introduce:
  - K_starv (% cover): coral resource threshold where starvation begins to increase.
  - k_starv (%^-1): steepness of the logistic around K_starv.
  - m_starv_max (yr^-1): maximum additional adult mortality when resource is extremely low.
- Starvation intensity (0–1), using previous-step resource R:
  f_starv = 1 / (1 + exp(k_starv * (R - K_starv)))
  where f_starv ≈ 1 when R << K_starv, and ≈ 0 when R >> K_starv.
- Adult mortality flux becomes:
  Mort_adult = (muC + gammaC * C_prev) * C_prev + (m_starv_max * f_starv) * C_prev

Expected effects
- Outbreaks can still initiate under high resource, but once coral is depleted, adult mortality increases sharply, producing faster and deeper busts consistent with observations.
- The juvenile stage and recruitment remain unchanged, preserving outbreak initiation dynamics while improving termination dynamics.

Notes
- No current-time observations are used in process equations; only t-1 states and covariates are used.
- Please provide residuals to verify that the added mechanism reduces post-peak positive residuals for COTS and improves lag structure of declines in coral and COTS.
