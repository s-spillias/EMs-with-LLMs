Assessment and rationale

1) Model fit to data
- A residuals file was referenced but not provided here. Without residual diagnostics, I base this assessment on the current process structure and common issues observed in COTS models.
- Likely fit issues given the present structure:
  - Overly prolonged high adult COTS densities after peak (outbreak “tail” too long), because adult mortality depends primarily on baseline + density-dependent terms and is weakly linked to prey depletion.
  - Timing mismatches of boom onset if recruitment is not sufficiently sensitive to environmental modifiers or prior state.
  - Coral declines may be captured, but rebounds could be delayed or too rapid depending on the balance of predation vs. regrowth.

2) Alignment with project context (episodic boom-bust outbreaks)
- Strengths:
  - Includes an Allee effect in reproduction, Gaussian temperature window for recruitment, and density-dependent mortality that can generate busts.
  - Multi-prey feeding with Type II/III blend and bleaching impacts on coral are represented.
- Gaps:
  - A key mechanism for sharp post-outbreak crashes is missing: starvation or prey-limited survival of adult COTS when coral cover is low after intense predation. Current adult mortality is largely a function of C and C^2 and does not explicitly increase when prey are scarce.
  - This limits the model’s ability to produce realistic rapid collapses following coral depletion, a hallmark of COTS dynamics.
  - Juvenile dynamics are aggregated into a single pool; while this can work, the absence of explicit prey-linked adult mortality is a more immediate limitation for capturing outbreak duration and decline.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Starvation mortality of adults at low coral cover (missing).
- External nutrient pulses affecting larval survival (partially present via cotsimm_dat, but not modeled with a saturating effect).
- Stage-structured juvenile pipeline causing delayed cohort maturation (simplified to one pool).
- Feedback of coral depletion on adult survival (missing; addressed below).

Chosen improvement

Approach: Resource limitation mechanism added to adult mortality (environmental modifier/feedback).
- Add a prey-dependent starvation mortality term that increases when combined coral cover (resource index R = wF*F + wS*S) is low.
- Ecological rationale: After an outbreak, adult COTS rapidly reduce coral cover; food scarcity then elevates mortality and accelerates population collapse, producing the characteristic bust.
- Mathematical form:
  - Define starvation mortality rate factor as: f_starve(R) = K_starve / (K_starve + R), where R is the resource index.
  - Additional adult mortality: Mort_starve = mu_starve_max * f_starve(R) * C
  - Total adult mortality becomes: Mort_adult_total = (muC + gammaC*C)*C + Mort_starve
  - Properties: At R→0, Mort_starve → mu_starve_max*C (maximum starvation); at R>>K_starve, Mort_starve → ~mu_starve_max*(K_starve/R)*C (negligible).
- Benefits:
  - Tightens the coupling between coral depletion and COTS collapse, improving magnitude and duration of post-peak declines.
  - Minimal added complexity (two parameters) with strong ecological justification.
- Expected residual improvements:
  - Reduced positive residuals for COTS during the decline phase (faster modeled collapse).
  - Better temporal alignment of the transition from boom to bust.

Parameter updates

Added parameters:
- K_starve (% cover): Half-saturation of resource effect on starvation mortality. Lower values imply starvation kicks in at relatively high coral depletion; higher values imply need for very low coral to trigger strong starvation.
- mu_starve_max (yr^-1): Maximum additional mortality rate at near-zero coral cover.

Bounds and initial values chosen to be broad but biologically plausible, and weakly enforced via smooth penalties in the likelihood.

Implementation notes

- Only previous-step state variables are used in process updates; no current-step observations are used (no data leakage).
- Recruitment, feeding, coral growth, and bleaching structures are unchanged.
- Adult mortality now includes Mort_starve computed from R = wF*F_prev + wS*S_prev at t-1.
- A diagnostic report vector (starve_vec) was added to aid evaluation of starvation mortality over time.

If residuals become available, we can re-check whether further refinements (e.g., stage-structured juveniles or multiplicative environmental recruitment modifiers) are warranted, but the starvation feedback is a high-leverage improvement for boom-bust realism.
