Assessment of current model relative to PROJECT CONTEXT (NPZ):
- Fit to data: A quantitative assessment requires the residuals file, which was not provided in this chat. Based on structure alone, the current model lacks bottom-up control on recruitment (f_food = 1.0), which often manifests as overprediction of COTS recruitment in warm/oligotrophic periods and underprediction in cool/nutrient-rich periods. Coral residuals may also reflect mis-specified outbreak timing through trophic coupling.
- Alignment with NPZ context: The model simulates COTS (predator of corals) and coral cover, not the NPZ compartments (nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton). However, a key NPZ mechanism relevant to COTS is bottom-up larval food limitation (phytoplankton), which can be introduced without fully replacing the model.
- Missing/oversimplified processes:
  1) Bottom-up resource limitation of recruitment is absent (K_food present in parameters.json but unused in model.cpp).
  2) No explicit phytoplankton/nutrient driver (P, N) feeding into recruitment success.
  3) Environmental modulation of larval survival via trophic conditions is oversimplified to temperature only.

Parameter review:
- K_food description indicates it should be “now actively used,” but the code sets f_food = 1.0. This mismatch suggests the structural intent has not been implemented.
- Other parameters sit within broad plausible bounds with weak penalties. No immediate structural conflicts identified besides the missing use of K_food.
- No updated literature values provided that force rescaling of other process equations.

Chosen improvement (ONE meaningful ecological improvement):
- Approach: Resource limitation mechanisms + Environmental modifiers of processes.
- Change: Implement a Monod-type bottom-up limitation of COTS recruitment using an SST-derived nutrient proxy:
  food_proxy = pospart(T_ref_food - SST_{t-1}) and f_food = food_proxy / (K_food + food_proxy).
  This leverages the ecological relationship that cooler SSTs often coincide with higher nutrient availability and phytoplankton biomass (enhanced mixing/upwelling), thus improving larval food availability and recruitment success.
- Rationale:
  - Captures a core NPZ concept (bottom-up control) without requiring a full NPZ submodel or new data inputs.
  - Keeps time indexing correct (uses t-1 SST).
  - Preserves smoothness and differentiability for TMB.
  - Uses existing K_food with an added T_ref_food parameter to control the proxy regime.

Structural and parameter updates:
- model.cpp: Replace neutral f_food = 1.0 with SST-proxy Monod term in recruitment.
- parameters.json:
  - Add T_ref_food (degC) with plausible bounds [20, 34].
  - Update K_food description to reflect SST-proxy usage.
- No changes to observation model or other processes; functional response and bleaching remain unchanged.

Future refinements (if residuals indicate specific issues or if additional data become available):
- If a phytoplankton time series (P) becomes available, replace SST-derived proxy with P_{t-1} in f_food = P / (K_food + P).
- Consider adding a background floor to f_food if zero-recruitment years are over-penalized.
- If residuals show cover-specific bias, allow qF, qS or handling h to vary with temperature or coral community composition.

Note on data leakage:
- All new terms use SST at t-1; no current time-step response variables are used.
