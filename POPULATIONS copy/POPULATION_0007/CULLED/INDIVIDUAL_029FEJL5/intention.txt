Assessment:
- Fit to data: Residuals file still not provided here, so I cannot quantify fit. Please share the residuals (or a summary by variable and time) to diagnose bias, variance, and temporal structure.
- Alignment with project context (NPZ mixed-layer model): The code models COTS–coral dynamics and lacks explicit N–P–Z states. A resource-limitation scaffold on recruitment (via f_food) is desirable to reflect NPZ bottom-up control.
- Missing processes relative to NPZ: Explicit nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton dynamics; currently recruitment lacks an active food limitation driver due to unavailable data.

Temporary adjustment to restore compatibility:
- The dataset currently does not provide a food_dat series. The prior version failed when reading DATA_VECTOR(food_dat).
- To maintain model operability with the existing data, I removed the required food_dat input and set the food modifier to a neutral value: f_food = 1.0 (no effect).
- This preserves all other dynamics (Allee effect, temperature recruitment response, Beverton–Holt taper, density-dependent mortality, bleaching, and multi-prey feeding).
- The K_food parameter remains defined for forward compatibility; it has no effect until a food driver is supplied.

Ecological reasoning and next step:
- Once a phytoplankton proxy (e.g., satellite chlorophyll or NPZ model P) is available, re-activate bottom-up control by reintroducing food_dat and computing f_food = food / (K_food + food) using the t-1 value to avoid any data leakage.
- If residuals show recruitment biases correlated with productivity, consider allowing an interaction surface between temperature and food rather than a simple product, but only if justified by data patterns.

Data usage discipline:
- All prediction calculations continue to use only previous time step values of exogenous drivers and state variables; no response data at the current time step are used in predictions.

Summary of changes:
- model.cpp: Removed DATA_VECTOR(food_dat) and the associated usage; set f_food = 1.0 as a neutral placeholder.
- parameters.json: No changes required. K_food retained for future use.
