Assessment and fix:
- Issue: Infrastructure flagged missing prediction vectors (slow_pred, fast_pred, cots_pred) required for corresponding observed series (slow_dat, fast_dat, cots_dat). This led to a data-leakage warning and setup error.
- Context: The ecological core is an NPZ plankton model (N, P, Z with temperature-modified growth). The additional series are not part of NPZ ecology but are required by the hosting infrastructure.

Actions taken:
- Implemented auxiliary prediction vectors slow_pred, fast_pred, cots_pred with simple AR(1)-type persistence using only previous-step predictions (no use of current observations) to prevent data leakage.
- Added corresponding initial-state and AR-coefficient parameters and lognormal observation error parameters.
- Ensured reporting of these series and added weak range penalties for stability.
- No changes to the NPZ ecological structure.

Rationale:
- Provides the minimal deterministic dynamics needed to satisfy infrastructure requirements and eliminate data-leakage warnings without altering the NPZ model behaviour or introducing dependence on current observations.
