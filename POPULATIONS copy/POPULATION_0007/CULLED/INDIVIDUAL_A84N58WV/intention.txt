Objective
- Build a dynamic, process-based Template Model Builder (TMB) model to predict episodic Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS; individuals per m2) outbreaks and their feedbacks on coral cover for two functional groups: fast-growing Acropora (fast; % cover) and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites (slow; % cover) on the Great Barrier Reef.

Ecological functioning (concise)
- Boomâ€“bust dynamics of COTS arise from interactions among: (i) resource-dependent growth fueled primarily by preferred prey (Acropora), (ii) immigration pulses of larvae, (iii) temperature-modulated performance and coral stress, and (iv) negative feedbacks from resource depletion and intraspecific density dependence.
- Coral groups grow logistically with interspecific competition and experience:
  1) Selective predation by COTS (Holling-type III functional response with saturation and prey refuge at low coral cover).
  2) Temperature-dependent bleaching mortality that increases smoothly when SST exceeds a thermal stress threshold.
- COTS population change combines:
  1) Ricker-type growth that scales with prey availability (saturating, threshold-like) and a bell-shaped temperature performance curve.
  2) Density dependence that self-limits outbreaks.
  3) Exogenous larval immigration, filtered by settlement efficiency that increases with live coral (especially Acropora).
- Indirect effects: Outbreaks depress coral cover (especially Acropora), which in turn reduces food and settlement habitat, hastening the collapse phase and lengthening recovery intervals. SST simultaneously (i) enhances COTS performance near an optimum and (ii) increases coral bleaching risk at high values, reinforcing busts after booms.

Numerical design
- All transitions are smooth (no hard cutoffs). Saturating and logistic forms prevent division-by-zero and use small constants (1e-8).
- Parameter ranges are softly enforced via smooth penalties; observation likelihoods are lognormal with minimum standard deviations for stability.
- Initial conditions are set directly from the first observations for each state (no data leakage from current time steps in the process equations).
