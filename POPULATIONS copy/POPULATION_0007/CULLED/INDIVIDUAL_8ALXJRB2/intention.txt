Purpose
- Predict episodic boomâ€“bust dynamics of Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef while jointly modeling selective predation impacts on two coral guilds: fast-growing Acropora (fast) and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites (slow).

Core processes
- COTS population dynamics are recruitment-driven with:
  - Resource-dependent larval success that saturates with total coral food (weighted sum of fast and slow coral cover).
  - A smooth Allee effect capturing mate-finding at low adult densities.
  - Temperature-modulated recruitment, peaking near an optimal SST and declining away from it.
  - Immigration forcing that can trigger outbreaks.
  - Density-dependent mortality that accelerates post-outbreak declines (bust phase).

- Coral dynamics are guild-specific with:
  - Logistic regrowth with competition for space between fast and slow corals (shared carrying capacity).
  - Selective predation by COTS via a multi-prey Holling-type functional response (Type II/III blend), with higher preference/efficiency on Acropora.
  - Temperature-induced bleaching that smoothly increases losses when SST exceeds a thermal threshold.

Feedbacks and outbreak mechanism
- Positive feedback (boom trigger): Higher coral food and favorable temperature increase larval survival and recruitment, steepening growth and enabling rapid outbreak onset.
- Negative feedback (bust): Predation depresses coral, which lowers resource-dependent recruitment; together with density-dependent mortality this collapses COTS density.
- Indirect effects: Coral depletion from predation weakens future COTS recruitment; temperature extremes both reduce coral growth and (off-optimum) reduce COTS recruitment.

Numerical/estimation choices
- Yearly discrete-time model with initial conditions fixed to the first observations (no data leakage).
- Smooth thresholds and soft penalties for biologically plausible parameter ranges.
- Lognormal errors for strictly positive COTS abundance; logit-normal errors for bounded coral cover (%).
- All observations are included with minimum standard deviations for numerical stability.

Outputs
- Time series predictions for cots_pred (ind/m2), fast_pred (% cover), slow_pred (% cover), aligned to the input Year vector.
