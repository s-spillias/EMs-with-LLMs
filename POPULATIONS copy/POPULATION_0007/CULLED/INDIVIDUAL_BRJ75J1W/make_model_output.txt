 +  The current code implements a coral–crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS)–temperature model with coral cover (%), adult/juvenile COTS densities,  
 bleaching, and a multi-prey functional response. The PROJECT CONTEXT, however, is an NPZ (nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton) mixed-layer mode

 +  The request instructs us to refer to a residuals file to evaluate fit, but no residuals were provided here. Without residuals, we cannot    
 quantitatively evaluate the current model fit to data. Qualitatively, the state and observation variables (COTS, fast/slow coral cover) are    
 incompatible with NPZ targets (N, P, Z), so fit assessment for NPZ is not applicable.

 +- Nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth (e.g., saturating uptake N/(K_N+N)) is absent.                                                  
 +- Zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton with a saturating/threshold functional response (Holling II/III) is absent in the NPZ sense (current   
 functional response targets coral).                                                                                                            
 +- Assimilation efficiency and partitioning of grazed P into Z growth vs. unassimilated waste returning to N are absent.                       
 +- Mortality terms and remineralization pathways that close the nutrient cycle are absent.                                                     
 +- External nutrient inputs and mixed-layer exchange (e.g., vertical mixing, advection, seasonal inputs) are absent.                           
 +- Temperature or light effects on phytoplankton growth and grazing are not implemented for NPZ (SST currently modulates COTS recruitment and  
 coral bleaching instead).

 +- Many parameters are specific to coral/COTS (e.g., bleaching parameters, coral growth rates rF, rS, COTS mortality muC, gammaC, functional   
 response on corals aF, aS, qF, qS, etc.). These do not translate to NPZ and would be removed or replaced in an NPZ model.                      
 +- Some parameters are grounded in literature values but for the wrong system (coral bleaching thresholds, handling times for coral predation) 
 Carrying these forward would not be ecologically meaningful for NPZ.                                                                           
 +- No evidence here of updated NPZ-relevant parameter values from literature searches. If such updates exist (e.g., typical ranges for mu_max, 
 K_N, g_max, assimilation efficiency), they should drive the choice of NPZ equations and priors/ranges.

 +- Chosen approach: Resource limitation mechanisms with environmental modifiers (core NPZ structure).                                          
 +- Rationale: The central dynamical feature of a mixed-layer NPZ model is nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth with zooplankton grazing, clos 
 by nutrient recycling. This captures the first-order controls on P and Z dynamics and their feedback on N. It is both parsimonious and         
 ecologically necessary. Temperature can modulate rates.

 +- alpha_N converts primary production to nutrient uptake units.                                                                               
 +- Bounds: enforce non-negativity with smooth functions (e.g., pospart) as in the current code.                                                
 +- Observation model: needs data vectors for P_dat, Z_dat, and optionally N_dat. Typical choices are log-normal or normal in log-space, possib 
 with temperature/seasonal observation variance.

 +Why no code changes in this commit                                                                                                            
 +                                                                                                                                              
 +- The present code and parameters are for a different ecological system. Implementing NPZ would require:                                      
 +  - Renaming/adding data inputs (N_dat, P_dat, Z_dat, possibly SST_dat retained)                                                              
 +  - Replacing state equations and parameter set                                                                                               
 +  - Revising the likelihood to match NPZ observables                                                                                          
 +- Without the residuals and target NPZ data schema, changing the code now risks misalignment with your data pipeline.                         
 +- Action requested:                                                                                                                           
 +  - Please confirm we should pivot this model to NPZ and share the residuals and data variable names for N, P, Z (and any environmental drive 
 to retain).                                                                                                                                    
 +  - If you want a draft NPZ implementation immediately, confirm the desired time step (annual vs. sub-annual) and observation error forms.    
 +
