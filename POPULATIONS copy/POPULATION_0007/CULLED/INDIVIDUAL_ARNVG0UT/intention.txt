Assessment and rationale

1) Model fit evaluation
- The brief references a residuals file, but it was not provided here. Without it, I cannot quantify bias, autocorrelation, or heteroscedasticity in the residuals. Please share the residuals to enable a targeted, data-driven critique (e.g., whether recruitment is systematically over/under-predicted during warm years, or whether coral cover errors co-vary with COTS abundance).
- Qualitatively, given the current structure lacks any active bottom-up resource limitation, recruitment variability driven by plankton availability is likely misrepresented or absorbed by other parameters (alpha_rec, phi, C_sat_rec), which may lead to biased dynamics and poorer fit if plankton variability is important.

2) Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT (NPZ)
- The current model is a COTS–coral predator–prey framework and does not explicitly model nutrient (N), phytoplankton (P), or zooplankton (Z).
- Parameters K_food and p_food exist but were not used (f_food was set to 1). Thus, the model does not incorporate the NPZ-style bottom-up control indicated by the project context.

3) Missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Bottom-up resource limitation: No explicit or latent representation of phytoplankton/food that modulates larval survival and recruitment.
- Environmental modifiers of food: Although SST modulates recruitment and coral processes, there is no coupling of SST to resource availability (P).
- Indirect pathways: Plankton dynamics can indirectly affect corals via COTS; this pathway is missing.

Parameter review and implications
- K_food and p_food were placeholders intended for a NPZ/food linkage but were neutralized (f_food=1). Because literature and ecological reasoning support food limitation of COTS larval survival, these parameters should be activated by introducing a food proxy.
- Other parameters (e.g., T_opt_bleach, rF, rS) are plausible and do not force structural changes at this time. If residuals show systematic thermal bias in recruitment, replacing the symmetric Gaussian with an asymmetric thermal performance curve could be considered later.

Chosen ecological improvement (one change)
- Approach: Resource limitation mechanism + environmental modifier
- Add a latent phytoplankton state P_t (food proxy) governed by logistic growth with a Gaussian thermal performance curve and linear loss:
  P_t = P_{t-1} + rP * P_{t-1} * (1 - P_{t-1}/K_P) * exp(-beta_P * (SST_{t-1} - T_opt_P)^2) - muP * P_{t-1}
- Use P_{t-1} in a Monod food-limitation term for COTS recruitment:
  f_food = (P_{t-1} / (K_food + P_{t-1}))^p_food
- Recruitment becomes:
  Rec = alpha_rec * [C^phi / (1 + C/C_sat_rec)] * f_Allee * f_Trec * f_food + cotsimm_{t-1}
- Notes:
  - All drivers are evaluated at t-1 to avoid data leakage.
  - This adds only one latent state and a few parameters, providing a principled bottom-up control consistent with the NPZ context.
  - The temperature-modified logistic for P captures environmental modulation without overfitting.

New/modified parameters
- New:
  - P0: initial latent phytoplankton; bounds [0, 100]
  - rP: phytoplankton intrinsic growth (yr^-1); bounds [0, 10]
  - K_P: carrying capacity (food units); bounds [1e-3, 1000]
  - muP: phytoplankton loss (yr^-1); bounds [0, 5]
  - T_opt_P: optimal SST for P; bounds [20, 34] °C
  - beta_P: curvature of thermal response; bounds [0, 2] °C^-2
- Activated (no structure change to parameter definitions, but now used):
  - K_food, p_food: now actively shape recruitment via Monod limitation using P.

Reporting and outputs
- P_pred (latent food proxy time series) is reported and ADREPORTED for diagnostics.
- No observation model was added for P to keep complexity limited; if residuals indicate identifiability issues, consider linking P to any available chlorophyll proxy later.

Next steps (pending residuals)
- If residuals show warm-year recruitment bias: consider an asymmetric temperature response for recruitment or a bleaching–reproduction interaction.
- If residuals show lag structure: consider adding a maturation/recruitment lag or slow-varying nutrient forcing on P.
- Please provide the residuals file to validate whether the new resource pathway reduces recruitment and COTS abundance errors.

Data leakage
- The implementation strictly avoids using current-time observed variables in prediction equations; only previous time-step SST and exogenous immigration are used.
