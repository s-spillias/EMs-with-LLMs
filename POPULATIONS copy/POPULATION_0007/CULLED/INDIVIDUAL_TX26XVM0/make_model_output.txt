 +- Residuals: A residuals file was referenced but not provided in this context. Therefore, the assessment below is based on model structure and typical misfit patterns for COTS boom-bust data. If available, please share    
 residuals to refine this assessment.

 +  - Early false-positive outbreaks: The current Ricker-style per-capita growth can allow growth from very low densities when temperature is favorable, even when mate encounter rates should be limiting. This often produces 
 premature increases relative to observed data.                                                                                                                                                                                 
 +  - Peak magnitude underestimation or timing offsets: Without a low-density threshold, the system may enter outbreak phases too frequently, smearing peaks across years rather than producing sharp, episodic pulses aligned  
 with favorable conditions and sufficient adult density.                                                                                                                                                                        
 +  - Bust duration: The crash phase may be too smooth because growth resumes immediately once temperature/food improve, even at very low densities, rather than requiring re-accumulation above a mate-limitation threshold.

 +  - Mate-finding/Allee effects at low COTS densities are a well-supported mechanism that can produce episodic, threshold-like transitions (boom-bust), preventing persistent low-level growth and better matching observed    
 outbreak initiation patterns.

 +- Ecological reasoning:                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 +  - COTS are broadcast spawners; fertilization success and effective reproduction are strongly reduced at low adult densities. Introducing an Allee effect creates a biologically realistic low-density threshold: population 
 below this threshold rely on immigration or sustained favorable conditions to cross into outbreak-capable densities.                                                                                                           
 +  - This directly addresses the project goal of capturing the timing and episodicity of outbreaks by requiring sufficient adult density and favorable environment to trigger rapid growth.

 +- Timing: Outbreak initiation will require both favorable environment and sufficient adult density (A_eff), delaying spurious early growth and better aligning with observed pulse onset.                                     
 +- Magnitude: Peaks can be sharper; once above threshold, growth proceeds rapidly under warm and food-rich conditions.                                                                                                         
 +- Duration: Bust phases are prolonged if density collapses below the threshold, as recovery will require immigration or sustained favorable conditions to rebuild density.

    • If you already have a run of the current model, exporting these makes it easy to compute residuals and inspect mechanisms.                                                                                                

If you can add at least Diagnostics/residuals.csv (with the schema above), I can use it to refine the model assessment and confirm whether the recent Allee-effect addition improves timing and peak dynamics.
