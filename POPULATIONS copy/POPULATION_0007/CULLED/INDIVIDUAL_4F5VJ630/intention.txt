Assessment and rationale for model update

1) Model fit to data
- The residuals file was not provided, so a quantitative assessment of fit is not possible here. Structurally, the model is well-posed, uses smooth functions, avoids hard truncations, and prevents data leakage by using only previous-step states in process equations.
- Please provide the residuals to refine the assessment (e.g., check for timing offsets of peaks, persistence bias, and prey-specific biases).

2) Alignment with project context
- Strengths:
  - Stage-structured COTS with juvenile delay supports boom-bust dynamics.
  - Resource-dependent recruitment via weighted coral cover introduces a key feedback linking prey and predator dynamics.
  - Smooth Allee effect on adult density models mating success thresholds for outbreak initiation.
  - Multi-prey functional response with Type-II/III blend and shared coral carrying capacity captures selective predation and space competition.
  - Temperature effects on recruitment and bleaching are included.
- Potential gaps or oversimplifications:
  - Fixed juvenile maturation rate (mJ) ignores coral-dependent acceleration of maturation, which is critical for timing the surge from juvenile cohorts into outbreaking adult populations.
  - No explicit representation of nutrient/runoff pulses beyond exogenous larval immigration.
  - Feeding is not temperature-sensitive (likely a secondary effect compared to maturation for outbreak timing).
  - Immigration lacks saturation/density effects.

3) Parameter review
- Most parameters are initial estimates; T_opt_bleach has updated bounds/values from literature.
- The single maturation parameter mJ is likely too rigid given known life-history dependence on food availability and ontogenetic diet shift. This can cause:
  - Outbreak peaks that occur too early/late relative to coral availability.
  - Outbreak durations that are too long if maturation remains high as coral declines, or too short if maturation is fixed low during high coral availability.

4) Chosen improvement: Resource-modulated maturation rate
- Objective: Improve timing and duration of outbreaks by linking juvenile-to-adult maturation to coral resource availability.
- Mathematical form:
  - R(t-1) = wF F(t-1) + wS S(t-1)
  - f_food(t-1) = R(t-1) / (K_R + R(t-1))
  - mJ_eff(t-1) = mJ_min + (mJ_max - mJ_min) * f_food(t-1), with 0 ≤ mJ_min ≤ mJ_max ≤ 1
  - Mat(t) = mJ_eff(t-1) * J(t-1)
  - J(t) = max(0, (1 - mJ_eff(t-1) - muJ) * J(t-1)) + Rec_in(t-1)
  - C(t) = max(0, C(t-1) + Mat(t) - Mort(t-1))
- Ecological justification:
  - High coral availability accelerates maturation, enabling rapid recruitment of adults and sharper outbreak onsets.
  - Coral depletion slows maturation, reducing adult inflow, thus sharpening busts and shortening peak duration.
  - Introduces a realistic resource limitation mechanism on a key life-history process with minimal added complexity.
- Implementation notes:
  - Added parameters mJ_min and mJ_max (bounded in [0,1]) and a smooth penalty to prefer mJ_max ≥ mJ_min.
  - Added a diagnostic report of mJ_eff over time.
  - All calculations use t-1 state variables to avoid data leakage.

Next steps
- Provide residuals to validate whether this change reduces timing bias of peaks, improves peak magnitude/duration match, and reduces autocorrelation in adult abundance residuals.
- If systematic biases remain, consider (in order): (a) nutrient/runoff pulse covariate on recruitment or juvenile survival, (b) temperature modulation of attack rate, (c) weak density dependence in larval settlement success.
