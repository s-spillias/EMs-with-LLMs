 +- However, a central process for episodic outbreaks is underrepresented: depensation (Allee effect) in broadcast spawners. For COTS, fertilization success declines sharply at low adult densities, creating a threshold-like 
 dynamic that helps explain the episodic transition from low background densities to outbreaks. Without this, models tend to allow unrealistically fast rebounds from near-zero.

 +- Ecological reasoning: As broadcast spawners, COTS require sufficient local density for gamete encounter. This produces low reproduction at low densities and a threshold that, once crossed, enables rapid population       
 increase—consistent with the observed episodic outbreaks.

If you have a different path/filename convention for these outputs, just share whatever you are already generating. With those files, I can quantify fit quality, inspect residual patterns across the boom-bust phases, and    
verify whether the recent Allee-effect addition improved timing and magnitude of outbreaks.
