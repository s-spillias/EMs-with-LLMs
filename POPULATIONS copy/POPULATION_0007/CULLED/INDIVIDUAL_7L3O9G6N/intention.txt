Assessment of current model and rationale for improvement

1) Fit to data
- Note: A residuals file was referenced but not provided in the current files. The following assessment is based on structural expectations for COTS boom-bust dynamics and typical fit issues (lags to peak, outbreak tail length, and amplitude).
- The current model includes key features that help fit outbreak characteristics:
  - Positive feedback at low adult density via a smooth Allee effect on recruitment.
  - A juvenile stage that provides a lag between reproduction and adult numbers.
  - Density-dependent adult mortality (gammaC*C) to curb high densities.
  - Coral depletion via selective predation, with handling/satiation and Type II/III blend.
  - Temperature effects on recruitment and coral growth/bleaching.
- Typical residual patterns in such systems include:
  - Overly slow collapses after peaks (outbreak tails too long).
  - Underestimation of peak amplitude or delayed peaks if growth feedbacks are too weak.
  - Coral losses during outbreaks captured reasonably, but recovery timings can be off if predator declines are too slow.

2) Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model targets episodic outbreaks and includes mechanisms to ignite (Allee + juvenile lag + recruitment nonlinearity) and to bust (density-dependent mortality and prey depletion).
- A key missing pathway for the bust phase is adult food-limited mortality. In reality, when coral cover is heavily reduced, adult COTS experience increased mortality due to starvation, accelerating the decline and shortening outbreak duration. This mechanism is especially important to reproduce the rapid post-peak collapses observed on the GBR.

3) Missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Adult food limitation: Mortality currently depends only on baseline and density and does not increase when coral cover is depleted. This can leave too-slow declines after peaks.
- Larval resource: Recruitment success is modulated by coral-based "resource" (wF*F + wS*S), which is an imperfect proxy because COTS larvae feed on microalgae/phytoplankton rather than coral. Without an external algal/nutrient driver in the data, we retain the existing term to avoid speculative changes, but note this as a structural caveat.
- Environmental pulses: Outbreaks are often linked to episodic nutrient inputs that boost larval survival. The provided cotsimm_dat accounts for larval immigration but not for unobserved nutrient pulses affecting local larval survival.

Chosen single ecological improvement

Approach: Resource limitation mechanism on adult mortality
- Add a coral-availability-dependent term to adult mortality that increases as food becomes scarce:
  - Define adult food availability as f_food_adult = R_adult / (K_Cfood + R_adult), with R_adult = wF*F + wS*S.
  - Add starvation mortality mu_starve * (1 - f_food_adult) to the adult mortality rate.
- Ecological rationale:
  - Directly captures starvation-driven collapse during and after outbreaks, aligning with GBR observations where COTS decline rapidly when preferred prey are depleted.
  - Complements existing density-dependent mortality and predation on corals.
  - Minimal additional complexity, no data leakage, and leverages coral states already in the model.
- Expected effect on dynamics:
  - Faster post-peak declines (shorter outbreak tails).
  - Stronger coupling between coral depletion and predator collapse.
  - More realistic boom-bust cycles in timing and magnitude.

Parameter updates
- Add mu_starve (yr^-1): strength of adult starvation mortality when coral is scarce. Suggested bounds: [0.0, 3.0].
- Add K_Cfood (% cover): half-saturation for adult food availability effect on mortality. Suggested bounds: [1.0, 100.0].
- Keep existing parameters unchanged, but narrow soft penalty bounds for T_opt_bleach to literature-informed values (30.5–34.3 °C) for consistency with parameters.json.

Implementation notes
- Recruitment continues to use the existing resource term to avoid introducing unobserved drivers.
- Process equations continue to use only previous time-step states (no data leakage).
- Diagnostics: mortality vector continues to report total adult mortality; starvation is embedded in Mort.

If you can share the residuals file, I can revisit and refine parameterization (e.g., K_Cfood scale, mu_starve magnitude) and consider whether the larval resource term should be revised or decoupled.
