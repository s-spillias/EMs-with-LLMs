Goal: Predict episodic boom–bust outbreaks of Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral communities (fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites) on the Great Barrier Reef, using a mechanistic, annually stepped model suitable for forecasting under varying initial conditions and environmental forcing.

Ecological functioning:
- COTS dynamics are driven by food-dependent reproduction and survival, density-dependent feedbacks, temperature-modified vital rates, and exogenous larval immigration pulses. When coral prey (especially Acropora) is abundant and warm conditions favor larval survival, per-capita reproduction increases and immigration pulses can push the population into outbreak, followed by density-dependent and starvation mortality as coral is depleted.
- Coral dynamics track (i) intrinsic regrowth under space limitation and interspecific competition, (ii) preferential predation by COTS described by a saturating, switching functional response (Type III), and (iii) temperature-driven bleaching mortality using a smooth threshold response.
- Indirect feedbacks create characteristic boom–bust cycles: COTS outbreaks reduce fast coral cover strongly, reducing future food intake and elevating starvation mortality, which collapses the outbreak and allows coral regrowth, potentially priming the system for a future outbreak when warm years and immigration pulses recur.
- Multiple forms of resource limitation are represented: (a) space-limited coral logistic growth with interspecific competition, (b) saturating prey selection and handling via Type III functional response, (c) food-limited COTS reproduction and survival, and (d) density-dependent COTS self-limitation.
- All transitions are smooth (no hard cutoffs), small constants prevent division by zero, and parameter ranges are encouraged via soft penalties. Observations enter the likelihood with lognormal errors and fixed minimum standard deviations. Initial states are set from the first observed values to avoid data leakage.
