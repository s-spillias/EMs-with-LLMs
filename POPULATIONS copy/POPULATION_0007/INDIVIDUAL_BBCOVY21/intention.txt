Assessment and rationale

1) Model fit
- The residuals file was not provided, so a quantitative fit evaluation is not possible here. Qualitatively, the previously proposed linkage of COTS larval success to plankton (P_dat) is ecologically sound for an NPZ context, but the dataset currently supplied to the model does not include P_dat. This caused the compile-time failure you reported.

2) Alignment with project context (NPZ)
- The project focuses on nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton (NPZ) dynamics. A direct larval food limitation term based on plankton would better align with this context. However, because P_dat is absent in the current data inputs, the code is updated to run without that dependency while keeping other ecologically realistic features (Allee effect, Beverton–Holt recruitment taper, temperature effects, and multi-prey coral consumption).

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Missing: explicit plankton/nutrient limitation of larval success. This remains a known gap pending availability of a plankton proxy (e.g., chlorophyll-a time series).
- Other simplifications retained to keep scope focused: constant feeding efficiencies, no explicit seasonality or mixing dynamics, no latent environmental process.

Changes made now (to restore a runnable model)
- Removed dependency on P_dat (external plankton proxy) to resolve the compile-time error due to missing data column.
- Removed parameter K_P since it is no longer used without P_dat.
- Recruitment remains: Rec = alpha_rec * [C^phi / (1 + C/C_sat_rec)] * f_Allee(C) * f_Trec(SST) + cotsimm, using only lagged states/drivers to avoid any data leakage.
- All other structures (Allee effect, Beverton–Holt recruitment taper via C_sat_rec, temperature recruitment modifier, coral growth with shared space and bleaching, and multi-prey functional response) are unchanged.

Parameter updates
- Removed K_P from parameters.json because no P_dat is provided. This avoids unused-parameter ambiguity and keeps the parameter set consistent with the current equation structure.
- No numeric values were changed for remaining parameters.

Next ecological improvement (recommended when data allow)
- Re-introduce a resource limitation term for larval success using a plankton proxy: f_plank(t-1) = P(t-1) / (K_P + P(t-1)). This is the most directly relevant enhancement for the NPZ project context and should improve timing and magnitude of recruitment pulses if suitable P_dat is available.
- If no P_dat will be available, a defensible alternative is a latent AR(1) environmental driver for recruitment that captures unobserved plankton variability; this would require adding a latent state vector and its parameters (mean, AR coefficient, process SD) and is not implemented here to minimize complexity.

Data-leakage note
- The model strictly uses only previous time-step values of response variables and exogenous drivers in prediction calculations, consistent with best practices.

What to look for in residuals once available
- Reduced phase error in COTS outbreaks (due to stock–recruit taper and Allee smoothing).
- Any remaining serial correlation in recruitment residuals likely indicates missing plankton limitation; that would be addressed by adding the plankton term when P_dat is supplied.
