Concise model intention: Predict episodic boom–bust outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS; adults, individuals m^-2) and their selective predation impacts on coral community composition (fast-growing Acropora vs. slow-growing Faviidae/Porites; cover in %). The model captures:
- Outbreak triggers: exogenous larval immigration pulses and temperature-modified larval survival that jointly amplify recruitment when adult COTS have high food (Acropora-dominated cover).
- Outbreak sustainment: positive feedback via high prey availability increasing adult condition and fecundity; switching/selective predation that initially targets fast corals, then shifts toward slow corals as fast corals decline, prolonging elevated COTS until food is depleted.
- Bust phase: density-dependent adult mortality and food depletion reduce survival and recruitment; coral recovery proceeds via space-limited logistic growth modulated by temperature.
- Environmental modulation: sea-surface temperature (SST) modifies coral growth (thermal performance curve) and COTS survival/larval survival.
- Resource limitation and thresholds: (i) coral growth saturates with remaining free space; (ii) COTS recruitment follows a saturating Beverton–Holt form with a smooth food threshold; (iii) multi-prey Holling type II functional response with soft prey preference switching.

State variables (observed and predicted): cots (individuals m^-2), fast (Acropora % cover), slow (Faviidae/Porites % cover). Forcing: sst (°C), cotsimm (immigrants m^-2 yr^-1). The model is discrete-time annual and initializes predicted states at the first observed values to avoid data leakage and to anchor the trajectory to empirical initial conditions.

Numerical safeguards: small constants avoid division by zero; smooth logistic/gaussian transitions replace hard cutoffs; posfun provides soft non-negativity and contributes a smooth penalty if violated; minimum observation standard deviations prevent degeneracy; logit-normal errors for bounded coral cover and lognormal errors for strictly positive COTS.
