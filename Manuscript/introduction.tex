Ecosystem models provide invaluable information for managing complex interactions between nature and people \citep{McCarthy2004, Holden2016}, but their development traditionally requires significant time and expertise, creating a bottleneck in addressing urgent environmental challenges \citep{Dichmont2017,Holden2024b}, particularly as climate change demands rapid, adaptable approaches for ecosystem management \citep{weiskopf2020climate,malhi2020climate}.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers great promise as a part of the solution to these modelling challenges, with potential to accelerate model development and enhance adaptability \citep{Spillias2024}. While initial efforts to apply AI in ecological modelling focused on machine learning approaches that rely on black-box methods \citep{morales2024developing}, emerging techniques in equation discovery and automated scientific discovery show particular promise \citep{Huntingford_Nicoll_Klein_Ahmad_2024,floryan2022data}. These methods can derive interpretable mathematical relationships directly from data, offering advantages over statistical emulators when modelling novel environmental conditions \citep{Schaeffer_2017,chen2024constructing,karniadakis2021physics}. Similarly, attempts to leverage large language models (LLMs) for direct time-series prediction \citep{zhang2024large,su2024large,hassani2024predictions,gandhi2024generative,bylund2024chatgpt,cao2023tempo,li2024lite,garza2023timegpt}, though successful in other fields, are unsuited for producing reliable ecological insights or testing management interventions. For instance, work on multimodal LLMs for environmental prediction \citep{li2024lite} achieves impressive accuracy in forecasting physical variables like streamflow and water temperature, but does not address the mechanistic relationships needed for ecosystem management and applications.

Rather than using AI to replace traditional modelling approaches, recent advances in AI coding capabilities suggest a more promising direction \citep{Xu2021}. Language models like o3-mini and Claude can assist in constructing mechanistic models \citep{Spillias2024}, maintaining interpretability while accelerating the development process \citep{TheRoyalSociety2024}. Recent demonstrations of LLMs automating scientific processes, from autonomous chemical experimentation \citep{burger2023autonomous} to biomedical research \citep{wang2024bioresearcher}, evidence synthesis \citep{spillias2024evaluating} and even fully automated scientific discovery \citep{kramer2023automated}, highlight their potential for systematic scientific work. The key challenge lies in developing frameworks that can systematically harness these capabilities while ensuring scientific rigor and maintaining human oversight in the discovery process \citep{kramer2023automated,Spillias2024}. To the best of our knowledge, such an approach has not been attempted yet in ecological modelling.

To address this challenge, we present ``AI for Models of Ecosystems'' (AIME), a novel framework that requires minimal inputs, only time-series data and research questions, and aims to produce ecologically sound mathematical models that explain the time-series data (Figure \ref{fig:modelling_intro}). AIME addresses the inverse problem of inferring ecologically meaningful mechanistic models and parameters that causally explain observed data. The inferred models can then be used to test management interventions and scenarios. When solving inverse problems through numerical optimization, practitioners usually predetermine the model and its allowable parameter ranges, which defines both the parameter space and its mapping to the observation space. Less commonly, the model itself is inferred directly from observations, as in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), System Identification, and Automated Algorithm Discovery. Successful model reconstruction in such scenarios requires extensive data to ensure statistical relations are represented in the observations. In addition, a common challenge across all inverse problem approaches is the need to impose constraints that prevent numerically accurate yet empirically unrealistic solutions. AIME differs from traditional and SciML approaches by leveraging information available to current LLMs to impose ecologically meaningful constraints on both forward models and parameter ranges. This addresses the significant limitation of sparse ecological observations. Within this framework, AIME employs Template Model Builder (TMB, a R/C++ library for efficient parameter estimation in complex nonlinear models) as its foundation, providing a rigorous statistical framework for ecological modelling. The system operates through an iterative process where an LLM generates candidate model structures as TMB-compatible equations, which are then evaluated against time-series data using normalized objective functions (where lower values indicate better model fit). These models undergo evolutionary optimization across multiple generations, where successful structures (referred to as ``individuals'') are selected and improved upon, while underperforming models are culled. This evolutionary approach systematically produces increasingly accurate representations of ecosystem dynamics and offers a way to explore relative support for multiple possible mechanistic structures.

We test AIME's ability to construct plausible ecological models through two complementary case studies that test different aspects of ecological modelling, each involving both dependent variables (state variables predicted by the model) and forcing variables (external drivers affecting the system). First, we evaluate the framework's ability to recover fundamental ecological understanding using synthetic data generated from a well-established nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) model \citep{edwards1999zooplankton}.  This controlled experiment tests AIME's equation-learning capabilities by comparing discovered equations against known mathematical relationships that represent core ecological processes. For our NPZ case study, we additionally evaluate models using ecological accuracy scores (on a scale of 0-8), which measure how well the generated models recover known ecological mechanisms from the reference model. These scores assess specific components like nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, and zooplankton dynamics, with higher scores indicating closer alignment with established ecological understanding. Second, we assess AIME's ability to provide management-relevant predictions using synthetic data based on Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) populations on the Great Barrier Reef, derived from existing MICE models \citep{Morello_Plaganyi_Babcock_Sweatman_Hillary_Punt_2014, Rogers_Plaganyi_2022,Plaganyi_Punt_Hillary_Morello_Thebaud_Hutton_Pillans_Thorson_Fulton_Smith_et_al_2014, Condie_Anthony_Babcock_Baird_Beeden_Fletcher_Gorton_Harrison_Hobday_Plaganyi_et_al_2021}. The COTS case study, with three dependent variables (COTS abundance, fast-growing coral cover, and slow-growing coral cover) and two forcing variables (temperature and COTS immigrants), tests the framework's robustness while focusing on a specific management challenge: quantifying outbreaks in a complex predator-prey system. Through systematic comparison of different LLMs (o3-mini, o4-mini, and GPT4.1 from OpenAI, Claude Sonnet 3.7 and 3.7 from Anthropic, and Gemini from Google), we evaluate how different AI capabilities affect model performance. This comparative approach demonstrates how our evolutionary framework can both recover theoretical ecological relationships and are potentially suitable for use in support of ecosystem management.
