This model incorporates variable nutrient storage in phytoplankton through an internal quota mechanism (Q). The quota represents stored nutrients that can support continued growth when external nutrients are scarce. Key features:

1. Nutrient uptake is regulated by the current quota level (uptake slows as storage fills)
2. Growth rate depends on the internal quota rather than external nutrients (Droop equation)
3. Enhanced mortality occurs when quota is severely depleted
4. Sinking rates increase under nutrient stress as cells become denser

This better represents how phytoplankton adapt to variable nutrient conditions in nature through storage and physiological responses. The mechanism creates a more realistic delay between nutrient depletion and growth limitation.
