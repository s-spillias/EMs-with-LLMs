This model incorporates light-dependent phytoplankton growth to better represent the physical constraints on primary production in marine ecosystems. The light limitation function follows a Steele formulation that accounts for both light limitation at low intensities and photoinhibition at high intensities.

The light intensity varies seasonally according to:
I(t) = I_opt * (1 + 0.6 * sin(2Ï€ * t/365))

This creates an annual cycle with peak light levels in summer and minimum in winter, scaled relative to the optimal light intensity (I_opt).

The growth rate is then modified by a light limitation factor:
f(I) = (I/I_opt) * exp(1 - I/I_opt)

This function peaks at I = I_opt and declines at both higher and lower light levels, representing photoinhibition and light limitation respectively. The beta parameter controls the steepness of photoinhibition.

This mechanistic addition better captures the seasonal forcing that drives many marine ecosystem dynamics, particularly in temperate and polar regions where light availability shows strong seasonal patterns.
