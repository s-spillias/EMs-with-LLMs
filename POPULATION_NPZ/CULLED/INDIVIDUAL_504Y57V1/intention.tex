\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Zooplankton Mortality}

This modification introduces nutrient-dependent mortality for zooplankton populations, representing a more realistic coupling between resource availability and consumer survival. The enhancement is motivated by ecological evidence that zooplankton experience increased mortality under nutrient-poor conditions, both directly through physiological stress and indirectly through reduced food quality.

The new mortality term takes the form:
\[
m_{total} = m_Z Z^2 + m_{Z_N} Z^2 \frac{K_{Z_N}}{N + K_{Z_N}}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $m_Z$ is the baseline quadratic mortality rate
\item $m_{Z_N}$ is the additional mortality coefficient under nutrient stress
\item $K_{Z_N}$ is the half-saturation constant for nutrient-dependent mortality
\item $N$ is the nutrient concentration
\end{itemize}

This formulation ensures that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mortality increases when nutrients are scarce (N → 0)
\item The effect diminishes at high nutrient levels (N >> K_{Z_N})
\item The quadratic form (Z²) maintains density-dependent control
\end{itemize}

This mechanism better captures the observed zooplankton dynamics, particularly during periods of nutrient limitation, and provides a more mechanistic representation of trophic interactions in the system.
