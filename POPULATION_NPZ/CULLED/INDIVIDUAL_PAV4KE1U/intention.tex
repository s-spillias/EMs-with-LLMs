This model enhancement implements nutrient-dependent uptake efficiency for phytoplankton, representing their ability to increase nutrient acquisition rates under favorable conditions (luxury uptake) and maintain efficient uptake under limitation.

The uptake term now includes a dynamic efficiency factor (eta_N) that varies with ambient nutrient concentration:
eta_N = eta_base + (eta_max - eta_base) / (1 + exp(-k_eta * (N - N_crit)))

Where:
- eta_base: Baseline uptake efficiency under nutrient limitation
- eta_max: Maximum efficiency under nutrient-replete conditions  
- k_eta: Steepness of efficiency response
- N_crit: Critical nutrient concentration where efficiency switches

This sigmoidal response captures:
1. Increased uptake efficiency when nutrients are abundant (luxury uptake)
2. Maintained baseline efficiency under limitation
3. Smooth transition between states
4. Physiologically realistic bounds on efficiency

This mechanism better represents how phytoplankton optimize their resource acquisition strategy based on environmental conditions, which is critical for capturing bloom dynamics and nutrient cycling in marine systems.
