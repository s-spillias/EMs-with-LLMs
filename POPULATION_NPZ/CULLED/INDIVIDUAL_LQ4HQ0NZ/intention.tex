This model incorporates prey-quality dependent grazing efficiency to better represent zooplankton-phytoplankton interactions. The grazing efficiency (alpha) depends on both ambient nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton nutrient status:

alpha = alpha_base + alpha_max * (N/(N + K_alpha)) * (P_quality)

where P_quality = N/(N + K_q) represents phytoplankton nutritional quality based on ambient nutrient conditions.

This mechanism captures how nutrient limitation affects trophic transfer efficiency through two pathways:
1. Direct effects of nutrient availability on zooplankton metabolism (original N/(N + K_alpha) term)
2. Indirect effects via reduced prey quality under nutrient limitation (new P_quality term)

This addition better represents the complex relationship between nutrient availability and predator-prey dynamics in marine systems, helping explain observed patterns in zooplankton growth efficiency.
