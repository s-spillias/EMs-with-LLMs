\section{Model Description}

This ecological model incorporates temperature dependence of biological rates to better represent seasonal and environmental influences on plankton dynamics. The model uses the Arrhenius equation to scale metabolic rates:

\[ \text{Rate}(T) = \text{Rate}(T_{\text{ref}}) \exp\left(\frac{E_a}{k_B}\left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{ref}}} - \frac{1}{T}\right)\right) \]

where $E_a$ is the activation energy (0.63 eV for photosynthesis), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is temperature in Kelvin, and $T_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference temperature (293.15 K = 20Â°C).

This mechanism captures how:
1. Metabolic rates generally increase with temperature
2. Phytoplankton growth and zooplankton grazing are temperature-dependent
3. Seasonal temperature variations affect ecosystem dynamics

The temperature scaling provides a mechanistic basis for temporal variations in biological rates, improving the model's ability to capture natural fluctuations in plankton populations.
