\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Zooplankton Mortality}

This modification introduces nutrient-dependent mortality for zooplankton populations, representing a more realistic coupling between environmental conditions and population dynamics. The enhanced model includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A new parameter K_M that determines how nutrient availability affects zooplankton mortality
    \item Modified mortality term that increases when nutrients are scarce
    \item Mechanistic link between system productivity and consumer survival
\end{itemize}

The effective mortality rate (m_Z_effective) is calculated as:
m_Z_effective = m_Z * (K_M / (K_M + N))

This formulation means that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When nutrients (N) are abundant, mortality approaches its baseline rate (m_Z)
    \item When nutrients are scarce, mortality increases, representing physiological stress
    \item The response is smooth and continuous, following established nutrient limitation kinetics
\end{itemize}

This change better captures the biological reality that zooplankton health and survival depend on overall system productivity, not just direct prey availability. It provides an additional feedback mechanism that can help explain observed population dynamics, particularly during nutrient-limited periods.
