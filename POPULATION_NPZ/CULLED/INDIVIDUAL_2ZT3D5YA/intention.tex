\section{Model Enhancement: Temperature-Dependent Growth}

We enhanced the ecological model by incorporating temperature dependence in phytoplankton growth rates using the Arrhenius equation. This mechanistic relationship better represents how metabolic processes fundamentally depend on temperature in aquatic ecosystems.

The growth rate $r(T)$ at temperature $T$ is modeled as:

\[
r(T) = r_{max} \exp\left(\frac{E_a}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_{ref} + 273.15} - \frac{1}{T + 273.15}\right)\right)
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $r_{max}$ is the maximum growth rate at reference temperature
\item $E_a$ is the activation energy (0.63 eV for photosynthesis)
\item $k$ is the Boltzmann constant (8.617 × 10^{-5} eV/K)
\item $T_{ref}$ is the reference temperature (20°C)
\item $T$ is the current temperature
\end{itemize}

This modification allows the model to capture how metabolic rates vary with temperature, which is particularly important for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Seasonal variations in primary productivity
\item Temperature-dependent biological rates
\item Metabolic scaling relationships
\end{itemize}

Future enhancements could include dynamic temperature variations based on seasonal or environmental data.
