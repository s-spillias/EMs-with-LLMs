This model enhancement introduces temperature-dependent zooplankton grazing efficiency to better represent seasonal dynamics in marine ecosystems. The modification is based on the metabolic theory of ecology, which predicts that temperature strongly influences consumer-resource interactions through its effects on physiological rates.

The grazing efficiency (alpha) now combines three components:
1. A baseline efficiency (alpha_base)
2. A nutrient-dependent component (as before)
3. A new temperature-dependent component

The temperature dependence follows an optimum curve rather than simple exponential scaling, reflecting that zooplankton typically have optimal temperature ranges for feeding efficiency. This better captures seasonal patterns in zooplankton biomass and their top-down control of phytoplankton populations.

This mechanism helps explain the observed temporal patterns in the data, particularly the pronounced zooplankton peaks and the phase relationships between nutrients, phytoplankton, and zooplankton populations.
