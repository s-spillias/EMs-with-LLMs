\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Zooplankton Assimilation}

This model enhancement introduces nutrient-dependent zooplankton assimilation efficiency. The basic assumption that zooplankton assimilation efficiency is constant (α) has been replaced with a dynamic efficiency (α_N) that depends on the nutrient:phytoplankton ratio. This better represents the ecological reality that zooplankton feeding efficiency varies with prey quality.

The modified assimilation term is:
α_N = α_base + α_max * (N/(N + K_α))

Where:
- α_base is the baseline assimilation efficiency
- α_max is the maximum additional efficiency possible
- K_α is the half-saturation constant for nutrient-dependent efficiency
- N/(N + K_α) represents nutrient limitation

This modification captures the observation that zooplankton assimilation efficiency typically improves when feeding on nutrient-rich phytoplankton, as documented in multiple marine studies. The relationship helps explain both the timing and magnitude of zooplankton population responses to phytoplankton blooms.
