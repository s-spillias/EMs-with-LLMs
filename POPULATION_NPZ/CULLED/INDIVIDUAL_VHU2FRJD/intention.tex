This model enhancement incorporates luxury uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton, a well-documented ecological process where cells can store excess nutrients when available. This storage provides a buffer against nutrient limitation and better captures the temporal dynamics of nutrient-phytoplankton interactions.

The implementation uses a variable internal quota model (Droop model), where:
- Nutrient uptake and growth are separated processes
- Growth depends on internal nutrient status (Q) rather than external concentration
- Uptake rate increases when internal stores are depleted
- Maximum storage capacity (Q_max) and minimum quota (Q_min) constrain the storage range

This mechanism helps explain:
1. The lag between nutrient depletion and phytoplankton decline
2. Continued growth during initial nutrient depletion
3. More realistic nutrient cycling dynamics
