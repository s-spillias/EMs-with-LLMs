This model incorporates nutrient quality effects on phytoplankton growth efficiency. While the base model only considered nutrient quantity through Monod kinetics, real phytoplankton growth depends on both the quantity and quality of available nutrients. We represent this by adding a nutrient quality factor that enhances growth efficiency when nutrient conditions are favorable.

The nutrient quality effect is modeled as an additional multiplier on the phytoplankton growth rate:
quality_factor = 1 + q_max * (N^h / (K_q^h + N^h))

Where:
- q_max is the maximum additional growth efficiency from nutrient quality
- K_q is the half-saturation constant for the quality effect  
- h is the Hill coefficient controlling the steepness of the quality response

This Hill function formulation creates a sigmoidal response where growth efficiency increases more rapidly above a threshold nutrient concentration, representing a shift to more bioavailable nutrient forms. This better captures the nonlinear relationship between nutrient availability and photosynthetic efficiency observed in natural systems.
