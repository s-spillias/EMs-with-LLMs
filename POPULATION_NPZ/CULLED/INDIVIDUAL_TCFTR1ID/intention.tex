\section{Ecological Mechanisms}

We enhanced the model by incorporating nutrient-dependent growth efficiency (phi_N) in the phytoplankton uptake process. This modification better represents how nutrient availability affects cellular photosynthetic efficiency and resource utilization.

The new efficiency term phi_N = phi_max * N/(K_N + N) creates a saturating response where:
- Under low nutrients, efficiency is reduced as cells struggle to maintain optimal metabolic processes
- As nutrients increase, efficiency approaches phi_max, representing maximum photosynthetic capacity
- Using the same half-saturation constant (K_N) maintains consistency with nutrient uptake kinetics

This mechanism captures an important feedback where nutrient limitation not only affects resource availability but also the efficiency of resource use. This better represents the physiological stress response of phytoplankton under nutrient limitation, which can help explain the observed patterns in bloom dynamics and system stability.
