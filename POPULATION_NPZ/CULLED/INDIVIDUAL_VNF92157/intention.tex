This model enhancement introduces luxury nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, a well-documented ecological process where cells can store excess nutrients when they are abundant. The key addition is a variable internal nutrient quota (Q) that can exceed the minimum requirements for growth.

The uptake rate now depends on both external nutrient concentration and how full the internal stores are (regulated by Q_max). When internal stores are low, uptake can exceed immediate growth requirements. This stored nutrient pool then supports growth when external nutrients become scarce.

This mechanism better represents the physiological plasticity of phytoplankton and helps explain how they can maintain high biomass even as external nutrients decline. It creates an important temporal buffer in nutrient-biomass dynamics that the original fixed-stoichiometry model couldn't capture.
