This model enhancement implements variable internal nutrient storage (luxury uptake) in phytoplankton. The key ecological reasoning is:

1. Phytoplankton can decouple nutrient uptake from growth by storing excess nutrients internally
2. This storage capacity provides a buffer against nutrient fluctuations
3. Growth rate depends on internal rather than external nutrient concentrations
4. Uptake rate varies with both external nutrients and current storage status

This mechanism is represented through:
- A new state variable Q representing the internal nutrient quota (nutrient:carbon ratio)
- Uptake rate that decreases as Q approaches maximum quota (Q_max)
- Growth rate that saturates with Q above minimum quota (Q_min)
- Separate equations for nutrient uptake and growth processes

This better captures the observed dynamics by allowing phytoplankton to:
- Take advantage of nutrient pulses through luxury uptake
- Continue growing when external nutrients are depleted
- Show more realistic time delays between nutrient uptake and growth
