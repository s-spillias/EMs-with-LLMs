\section{Nutrient-Dependent Growth Efficiency}

We incorporate nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency to better represent how resource availability affects photosynthetic capacity. The efficiency term $\phi_N$ scales from 0 to $\phi_{max}$ following a Monod function of ambient nutrient concentration:

\[\phi_N = \phi_{max} \frac{N}{N + K_N}\]

This modification captures the physiological response where nutrient limitation reduces photosynthetic efficiency even when light conditions are favorable. The mechanism represents:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced chlorophyll synthesis under nutrient stress
\item Impaired photosynthetic protein complex assembly
\item Downregulation of carbon fixation machinery
\end{itemize}

The efficiency scaling provides an additional pathway for resource limitation to affect growth beyond simple uptake kinetics, better matching observed system dynamics.
