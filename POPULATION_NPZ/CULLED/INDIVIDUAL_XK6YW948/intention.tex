This model enhancement incorporates light limitation in phytoplankton growth using a simplified seasonal light function. The addition represents:

1. Light-dependent growth: Phytoplankton growth is now co-limited by both nutrients and light availability
2. Seasonal variation: A sinusoidal function approximates annual light cycles
3. Photoinhibition: Growth reduction at both low and high light levels using an optimal light intensity parameter

The light limitation function follows a Gaussian curve around the optimal light intensity (I_opt), capturing both light limitation at low intensities and photoinhibition at high intensities. This better represents the physiological response of phytoplankton to varying light conditions throughout the year.

This modification should improve the model's ability to capture seasonal patterns in phytoplankton dynamics, which in turn affect nutrient uptake and zooplankton grazing patterns.
