This model incorporates nutrient-dependent zooplankton grazing efficiency to better represent predator-prey dynamics. When nutrients are abundant, phytoplankton cells have higher nutrient content and better biochemical composition, making them more nutritious prey for zooplankton. This is implemented by making the grazing half-saturation constant (K_P) decrease under high nutrient conditions, representing more efficient capture and processing of nutrient-rich prey.

The modification creates an indirect positive effect of nutrients on zooplankton through enhanced grazing efficiency, helping explain the observed strong initial zooplankton peak when nutrients are high. This represents a more realistic coupling between nutrient conditions and trophic transfer efficiency in marine food webs.
