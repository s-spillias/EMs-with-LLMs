The model has been enhanced to include nutrient-dependent photosynthetic efficiency (eta). This modification better represents how nutrient availability affects phytoplankton growth beyond simple resource limitation.

In natural systems, phytoplankton cells adapt their photosynthetic machinery and cellular composition based on nutrient availability. Under nutrient stress, cells may reduce their photosynthetic efficiency and alter their stoichiometry. The new parameter eta_max represents the maximum efficiency achievable under optimal nutrient conditions.

The nutrient-dependent efficiency term eta = eta_max * N/(N + K_N) creates a saturating response where:
- Under high nutrients (N >> K_N), efficiency approaches eta_max
- Under low nutrients (N << K_N), efficiency is reduced proportionally
- The half-saturation constant K_N determines the nutrient level where efficiency reaches half maximum

This mechanism provides a more realistic representation of how nutrient limitation affects phytoplankton growth through both resource availability and physiological adaptation.
