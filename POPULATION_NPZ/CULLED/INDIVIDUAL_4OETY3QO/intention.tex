This model incorporates temperature dependence of biological rates to better represent seasonal and environmental influences on plankton dynamics. The modification follows the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, using the Arrhenius equation to scale rates with temperature:

Rate(T) = Rate(T_ref) * exp(E_a/k_B * (1/T_ref - 1/T))

where:
- T is temperature in Kelvin
- T_ref is the reference temperature
- E_a is the activation energy
- k_B is the Boltzmann constant

This mechanistic relationship captures how metabolic processes like photosynthesis and grazing accelerate with warming, affecting nutrient cycling. The chosen activation energy (E_a) reflects typical values for autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in marine systems.

The temperature dependence helps explain:
1. Seasonal variations in plankton growth and grazing
2. Different temperature sensitivities of producers and consumers
3. Acceleration of nutrient cycling in warmer conditions

This addition provides a more realistic representation of how environmental conditions modulate biological rates and ecosystem dynamics.
