\section{Ecological Mechanism: Nutrient-Dependent Photosynthetic Efficiency}

We have enhanced the model by incorporating nutrient-dependent photosynthetic efficiency, represented by the term $\phi = \phi_{max} \frac{N}{N + K_{\phi}}$. This modification captures how nutrient limitation affects phytoplankton's ability to perform photosynthesis effectively.

\subsection{Ecological Justification}
Nutrient availability, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, directly affects the synthesis of photosynthetic machinery in phytoplankton. Under nutrient stress:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cells reduce chlorophyll content
    \item Photosystem repair and maintenance is impaired
    \item Overall photosynthetic capacity decreases
\end{itemize}

This mechanism creates a more realistic coupling between nutrient availability and primary production, potentially improving the model's ability to capture:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Early bloom dynamics
    \item Resource limitation effects
    \item System recovery after nutrient depletion
\end{itemize}

The functional form follows a Monod-type relationship, consistent with empirical observations of how nutrient limitation affects photosynthetic efficiency in marine phytoplankton.
