This model incorporates luxury uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton, separating nutrient acquisition from growth. This better represents how phytoplankton can store excess nutrients when they are abundant and continue growing when external nutrients become scarce.

The key mechanisms are:
- Tracking internal nutrient quotas (Q) in phytoplankton cells
- Nutrient uptake rate depends on external nutrients and current quota
- Growth rate depends on internal quota rather than external nutrients
- Maximum quota (Q_max) and minimum quota (Q_min) constrain storage

This allows phytoplankton to:
1. Take advantage of nutrient pulses by storing excess
2. Continue growing when external nutrients are depleted
3. Show more realistic time lags between nutrient uptake and growth

This mechanism is well-documented in phytoplankton ecology and helps explain bloom dynamics and competitive interactions.
