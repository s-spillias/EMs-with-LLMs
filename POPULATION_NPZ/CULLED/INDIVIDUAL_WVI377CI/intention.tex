This model incorporates light limitation in phytoplankton growth using a simplified seasonal light function. The maximum growth rate is modulated by both nutrient availability (Monod kinetics) and light availability (sinusoidal seasonal variation).

The light limitation function L(t) = 1 + β * sin(2π * t/365) represents seasonal variation in light availability, where:
- β controls the amplitude of seasonal variation
- t/365 scales time to yearly cycles
- The +1 term keeps light positive

This addition makes the model more mechanistically realistic by:
1. Capturing seasonal forcing effects on primary production
2. Representing a key resource limitation beyond just nutrients
3. Providing a mechanism for periodic forcing that can drive system dynamics

The phytoplankton growth term becomes: r_max * L(t) * N/(K_N + N) * P
