\section{Ecological Intention}

We incorporate nutrient-dependent prey quality effects on grazing efficiency to better represent trophic transfer dynamics. This modification reflects that nutrient-stressed phytoplankton are often poor-quality food for zooplankton, reducing the efficiency of energy transfer up the food chain.

The prey quality modifier (prey\_quality) scales from 0 to q\_max based on ambient nutrient concentrations:

prey\_quality = q\_max * N / (N + K\_q)

This creates a feedback where nutrient limitation not only affects phytoplankton growth directly, but also reduces their value as prey. This mechanism is well-documented in marine systems where nutrient-stressed phytoplankton have reduced nutritional content and can be harder for zooplankton to digest efficiently.

The modification affects both the grazing rate and nutrient recycling, representing:
1. Reduced feeding efficiency on poor-quality prey
2. Changes in nutrient recycling due to varying prey quality

This better captures the complex relationship between nutrient availability and trophic transfer efficiency in marine food webs.
