The model now incorporates a more mechanistic representation of how nutrient limitation affects phytoplankton mortality. The new formulation uses a power-law response (controlled by m_P_shape) to capture the non-linear deterioration of cellular health under nutrient stress.

This better reflects the biological reality that phytoplankton cells can maintain function under moderate nutrient limitation through various adaptation mechanisms, but experience rapidly increasing mortality once nutrients drop below critical thresholds. The shape parameter allows the model to capture different physiological responses across species or communities.

The modified equation represents:
1. Initial resilience to mild nutrient stress through cellular reserves and adaptation
2. Accelerating mortality as stress becomes severe and cellular maintenance fails
3. Maximum mortality rate under extreme nutrient limitation

This replaces the previous linear response which didn't capture the observed threshold-like behavior in the mortality data.
