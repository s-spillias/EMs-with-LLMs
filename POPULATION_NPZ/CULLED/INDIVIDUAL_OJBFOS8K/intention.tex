This model enhancement introduces nutrient-dependent zooplankton mortality to better capture the coupling between nutrient availability and zooplankton population dynamics. The modification reflects that zooplankton experience increased mortality under nutrient-poor conditions through multiple mechanisms:

1. Reduced food quality: When nutrients are scarce, phytoplankton have poor nutritional value, leading to increased zooplankton mortality even when prey biomass is present.

2. Metabolic stress: Low nutrient conditions often correlate with other environmental stressors that increase zooplankton mortality.

3. Population regulation: The nutrient-dependent mortality term provides a mechanistic way to represent how resource limitation controls zooplankton biomass.

The mathematical formulation uses the same Monod-type kinetics as nutrient uptake, with mortality increasing as nutrient concentrations decrease. This maintains consistency with other resource-limitation processes in the model while adding an important feedback mechanism between nutrient availability and zooplankton population control.
