\section{Model Description}

This ecological model has been enhanced to include temperature dependence of biological rates using the Arrhenius equation. This modification recognizes that metabolic processes in marine ecosystems are fundamentally controlled by temperature, which affects reaction kinetics at the molecular level.

The temperature scaling follows the Boltzmann-Arrhenius relationship:

\[ f(T) = \exp\left(\frac{E_a}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_{ref}} - \frac{1}{T}\right)\right) \]

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $E_a$ is the activation energy (eV)
\item $k$ is the Boltzmann constant (eV/K)
\item $T_{ref}$ is the reference temperature (K)
\item $T$ is the ambient temperature (K)
\end{itemize}

This scaling factor is applied to both phytoplankton growth rates and zooplankton grazing rates, as these processes are driven by enzyme-mediated reactions that exhibit temperature dependence. The activation energy ($E_a$) value of 0.63 eV is based on empirical studies of marine plankton metabolism.

The temperature dependence allows the model to capture seasonal and spatial variations in biological rates, potentially improving its ability to represent natural ecosystem dynamics. This mechanistic approach is preferable to fixed rate constants as it explicitly accounts for a fundamental physical driver of biological processes.
