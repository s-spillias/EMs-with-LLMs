This model incorporates luxury uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton, a key ecological mechanism where cells can store excess nutrients beyond their immediate growth requirements. This storage capacity is represented by Q_store, which modifies nutrient uptake rates based on the cell's current storage status.

The storage-dependent uptake mechanism uses:
- Q_min: Minimum cellular nutrient quota needed for survival
- Q_max: Maximum storage capacity for nutrients
- Q_store: Current nutrient storage level per unit biomass
- f_store: A function that reduces uptake as storage approaches maximum

This better represents how phytoplankton can rapidly acquire nutrients when available and continue growing even as external nutrients decline, leading to more realistic bloom dynamics and nutrient drawdown patterns.
