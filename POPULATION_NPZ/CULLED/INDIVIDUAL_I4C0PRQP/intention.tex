\section{Model Description}

This model incorporates nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency to better represent physiological adaptations to nutrient limitation. Under nutrient stress, phytoplankton can upregulate nutrient transporters and modify their metabolic pathways to maintain growth with less available nutrients. This is represented by an efficiency term that increases as nutrient concentrations decrease:

\[ \eta_N = \eta_{base} + \eta_{max} \frac{K_N}{N + K_N} \]

where $\eta_{base}$ is the baseline growth efficiency, $\eta_{max}$ is the maximum additional efficiency under nutrient limitation, and $K_N$ is the half-saturation constant. This mechanism allows phytoplankton to partially compensate for low nutrient conditions, leading to more realistic bloom dynamics and improved representation of the system's resource limitation patterns.
