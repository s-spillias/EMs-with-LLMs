\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Phytoplankton Mortality}

We enhanced the ecological model by incorporating nutrient-dependent phytoplankton mortality. This modification better represents the physiological stress that phytoplankton experience under nutrient-limited conditions. The key changes are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Added parameter m\_P\_N to represent additional mortality under nutrient stress
    \item Modified phytoplankton mortality term to increase when ambient nutrients are low
    \item Used Monod-type formulation to smoothly transition between normal and stressed states
\end{itemize}

The nutrient stress mortality term takes the form:
\[ \text{nutrient\_stress} = m_{P\_N} \frac{K_N}{N + K_N} \]

This formulation ensures that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mortality increases as nutrient concentration decreases
    \item The effect is strongest when N << K_N
    \item The additional mortality approaches zero when nutrients are abundant
\end{itemize}

This mechanism helps explain the observed rapid decline in phytoplankton populations after bloom events, when nutrients become depleted. It represents an important feedback between resource availability and population dynamics that was missing from the original model.
