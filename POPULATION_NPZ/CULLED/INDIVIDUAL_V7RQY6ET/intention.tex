This model incorporates nutrient-dependent zooplankton mortality to capture bottom-up control effects in marine ecosystems. When nutrients are scarce (low N), zooplankton experience higher mortality rates, reflecting physiological stress and reduced survival in resource-limited conditions. This mechanism creates an indirect coupling between nutrient availability and top predator dynamics, which better represents the cascading effects of resource limitation through the food web.

The modified mortality term Z_mort = m_Z * Z^2 / (1 + N/(K_N + eps)) increases when N is low and approaches the original quadratic mortality when N is high. This formulation:
1. Maintains mathematical stability through quadratic density dependence
2. Uses the existing half-saturation constant K_N to maintain parameter parsimony
3. Creates a mechanistic link between resource availability and predator survival

This change should improve the model's ability to capture:
- Long-term zooplankton population dynamics
- Ecosystem responses to nutrient limitation
- Trophic cascade effects
