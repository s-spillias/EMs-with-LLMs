This model incorporates nutrient storage (luxury uptake) by phytoplankton, which is a well-documented ecological process where cells can accumulate nutrients beyond their immediate growth requirements. This is represented through:

1. Internal nutrient quota (Q): The amount of nutrients stored within cells
2. Quota-dependent growth: Growth rate increases with internal nutrients until saturation
3. Uptake regulation: Uptake slows as cells approach their maximum storage capacity

This mechanism allows phytoplankton to:
- Buffer against nutrient fluctuations
- Maintain growth during temporary nutrient depletion
- Achieve higher peak biomass through stored nutrients
- Better compete through storage strategies

The implementation uses the Droop equation for quota-dependent growth and includes feedback between internal quota and uptake rate, capturing the physiological trade-offs in nutrient storage.
