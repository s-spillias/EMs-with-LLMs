\section{Model Description}

This ecological model incorporates temperature dependence on biological rates using the Boltzmann-Arrhenius relationship:

\[ f(T) = e^{\frac{-E_a}{k} (\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_{ref}})} \]

where $E_a$ is the activation energy (eV), $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $T_{ref}$ is the reference temperature.

This temperature scaling affects both phytoplankton growth and zooplankton grazing rates, as these processes are fundamentally controlled by metabolic rates. The temperature dependence creates seasonal-like variations in biological activity that can better capture the observed oscillations in population dynamics.

The model uses literature-based activation energy values typical for photosynthesis and heterotrophic metabolism in marine plankton communities.
