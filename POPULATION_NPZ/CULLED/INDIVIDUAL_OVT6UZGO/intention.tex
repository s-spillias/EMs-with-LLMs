This model enhancement incorporates light limitation as a key environmental driver of phytoplankton growth. The additions include:

1. Light-dependent growth limitation:
   - Added seasonal light variation using a simplified annual cycle
   - Implemented Monod-type light limitation kinetics
   - Separated nutrient and light limitation terms for clearer mechanistic representation

2. Ecological justification:
   - Phytoplankton growth depends critically on both nutrients and light
   - Seasonal light patterns often drive annual cycles in marine ecosystems
   - Multiplicative limitation (Liebig's law) better represents co-limitation
   - The original model's poor fit to nutrient dynamics suggests missing environmental drivers

3. Parameter choices:
   - K_I value based on typical half-saturation constants for marine phytoplankton
   - I_0 represents average surface irradiance in temperate regions
   - Seasonal variation captures typical mid-latitude annual cycles

This change should improve the model's ability to capture seasonal patterns and better represent the mechanistic basis of phytoplankton growth limitation.
