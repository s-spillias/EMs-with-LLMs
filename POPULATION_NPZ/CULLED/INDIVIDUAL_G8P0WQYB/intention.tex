This model enhancement introduces nutrient-dependent photosynthetic efficiency to better represent how nutrient limitation affects phytoplankton's ability to utilize light. Under nutrient stress, phytoplankton reduce their chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity, creating an important feedback between nutrient availability and light utilization.

The light limitation factor is now modified by a nutrient-dependent efficiency term:
photo_efficiency = phi_max * (N / (N + K_phi))

where:
- phi_max is the maximum photosynthetic efficiency adjustment
- K_phi is the half-saturation constant for nutrient-dependent photosynthetic efficiency

This mechanism represents how nutrient limitation reduces photosynthetic efficiency through decreased chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthetic protein production, a well-documented physiological response in phytoplankton.
