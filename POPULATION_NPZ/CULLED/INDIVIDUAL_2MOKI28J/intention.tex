\section{Model Enhancement: Light-Dependent Growth}

The original model considered temperature effects on metabolic rates but overlooked the crucial role of light in phytoplankton growth. Marine primary production is fundamentally dependent on both nutrient availability and light intensity, with seasonal variations in light being a major driver of plankton dynamics.

We incorporated light limitation using a Monod-type function:
\[
\text{Light limitation} = \frac{I_0}{K_I + I_0}
\]
where $I_0$ represents surface light intensity (varying seasonally) and $K_I$ is the half-saturation constant for light.

The phytoplankton growth term now becomes:
\[
\text{Growth} = r_{max} \cdot T_{factor} \cdot \frac{N}{K_N + N} \cdot \frac{I_0}{K_I + I_0} \cdot P
\]

This multiplicative formulation follows Liebig's Law of the Minimum, where growth is constrained by both nutrient and light availability. The seasonal light pattern ($I_0$) introduces an annual cycle that can help explain observed temporal patterns in phytoplankton biomass and subsequent ecosystem dynamics.
