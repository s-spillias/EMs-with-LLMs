\section{Ecological Model Enhancement: Adaptive Nutrient Uptake}

We enhanced the model's representation of phytoplankton nutrient uptake by incorporating an adaptive efficiency mechanism. The new formulation adds a term that increases uptake efficiency when nutrient concentrations are low:

\[ \text{adaptive\_efficiency} = 1 + 0.5 \frac{K_N}{N + K_N} \]

This represents the physiological adaptation of phytoplankton to nutrient limitation through:
\begin{itemize}
\item Increased expression of nutrient transporters
\item Optimization of cellular nutrient quotas
\item Enhanced affinity for nutrients at low concentrations
\end{itemize}

The factor increases uptake by up to 50\% under severe nutrient limitation (N << K_N) but has minimal effect when nutrients are abundant (N >> K_N). This mechanistic addition better captures the observed phytoplankton dynamics while maintaining biological realism.

The adaptive response is based on empirical studies showing upregulation of nutrient transport systems under limitation (e.g., Flynn et al. 2001, Journal of Plankton Research).
