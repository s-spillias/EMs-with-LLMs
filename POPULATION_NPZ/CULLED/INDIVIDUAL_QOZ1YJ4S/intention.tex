\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Growth Efficiency}

We have enhanced the ecological model by incorporating nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency (η). This modification better represents how phytoplankton's ability to convert nutrients into biomass varies with nutrient availability. The efficiency follows a quadratic saturation response:

η = η_max * (N²)/((K_N + N)²)

Key ecological justifications:
1. Under low nutrient conditions, phytoplankton operate at reduced efficiency due to increased metabolic costs of nutrient acquisition
2. As nutrients become more available, conversion efficiency improves until reaching maximum efficiency (η_max)
3. The quadratic form creates a steeper efficiency response to nutrient availability compared to traditional Monod kinetics

This mechanism helps explain:
- The higher observed phytoplankton peaks in the data
- More realistic nutrient-to-biomass conversion dynamics
- Better representation of resource limitation effects on growth

The modification maintains model parsimony while adding an important physiological mechanism that is well-supported in the literature.
