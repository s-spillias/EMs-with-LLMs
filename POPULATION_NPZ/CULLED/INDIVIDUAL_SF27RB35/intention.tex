\section{Temperature-Dependent Nutrient Uptake}

We have enhanced the ecological realism of the model by incorporating temperature-dependent nutrient uptake efficiency in phytoplankton. This modification is based on well-established physiological principles:

1. Membrane fluidity increases with temperature, affecting nutrient transport across cell membranes
2. Enzyme kinetics are temperature-dependent, with generally higher efficiency at warmer temperatures
3. Nutrient uptake proteins and transporters function more efficiently in warmer conditions

The modified half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake (K_N_T) now varies with temperature:

K_N_T = K_N_base * (1 - θ_N * (T_scale - 1))

where:
- K_N_base is the baseline half-saturation constant
- θ_N is the temperature sensitivity parameter
- T_scale is the metabolic temperature scaling factor

This formulation allows for more efficient nutrient uptake at higher temperatures (lower K_N_T), reflecting the enhanced membrane fluidity and enzyme activity. The relationship is bounded to prevent unrealistic values, while capturing the fundamental physiological response to temperature changes.

This mechanism should improve the model's ability to capture:
- Seasonal variations in nutrient uptake efficiency
- The timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms
- The coupling between environmental conditions and population dynamics
