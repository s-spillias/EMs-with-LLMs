This model enhancement incorporates temperature-dependent photosynthetic efficiency for phytoplankton growth. The modification is based on the metabolic theory of ecology, which suggests that photosynthetic efficiency varies with temperature following an Arrhenius relationship.

The new parameter E_p represents the activation energy specific to photosynthetic processes, which differs from the general metabolic activation energy (E_a) already in the model. This allows the model to capture the differential temperature sensitivity of photosynthesis compared to other metabolic processes.

The temperature dependence is implemented through a photosynthetic efficiency factor (photo_eff) that modifies the maximum growth rate (r_max). This better represents how temperature affects the light-harvesting and carbon-fixation machinery of phytoplankton, leading to more realistic bloom dynamics.

This mechanism is particularly important for capturing the observed early-season bloom magnitudes, as seen in the historical data where the model previously underestimated peak abundances.
