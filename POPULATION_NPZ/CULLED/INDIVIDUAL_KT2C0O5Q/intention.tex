This model enhancement introduces temperature-dependent phytoplankton mortality using a quadratic deviation from optimal temperature conditions. The functional form captures how mortality increases more rapidly as temperature deviates further from optimal conditions, representing the combined effects of:

1. Metabolic stress from increased maintenance costs
2. Protein and enzyme denaturation
3. Cell membrane destabilization
4. Enhanced oxidative stress

The quadratic response (temp_scale - 1.0)^2 means that mortality increases symmetrically for both warmer and cooler temperatures relative to the reference temperature. The m_P_T parameter controls the strength of this temperature effect.

This mechanism is ecologically important because phytoplankton experience multiple stressors that can lead to cell death when temperatures deviate from their optimal range. The original model only captured nutrient stress mortality, but temperature stress can be equally important in determining population dynamics, especially given seasonal temperature variations.
