This model enhancement implements luxury uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton, separating nutrient uptake from growth processes. This better represents how phytoplankton can store excess nutrients when they are abundant and continue growing when external nutrients become scarce.

The key changes are:
- Adding internal nutrient quota (Q) tracking for phytoplankton
- Making growth rate depend on internal rather than external nutrient concentration
- Implementing separate uptake kinetics based on quota status

This mechanism is ecologically important because:
1. It provides a buffer against nutrient fluctuations
2. It allows continued growth during temporary nutrient depletion
3. It better captures the delayed response to nutrient changes
4. It represents a key competitive advantage of phytoplankton

The implementation uses standard quota-based growth formulations (Droop model) where:
- Uptake rate decreases as internal quota approaches maximum
- Growth rate increases with internal quota but saturates
- Minimum quota represents stored nutrients required for basic cell function
