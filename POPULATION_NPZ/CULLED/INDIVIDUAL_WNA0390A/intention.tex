\section{Model Description}

This ecological model incorporates nutrient-dependent mortality for both phytoplankton and zooplankton to better represent resource limitation effects. When nutrient concentrations are low:

For phytoplankton:
1. Cellular stress increases due to nutrient deficiency
2. Reduced ability to maintain cellular functions
3. Higher susceptibility to viral lysis

For zooplankton:
1. Reduced metabolic efficiency from poor food quality
2. Increased susceptibility to disease
3. Compromised reproduction success

The mortality rates are modeled using Monod-type functions where:
- Base mortality (m_P, m_Z) occurs under all conditions
- Additional mortality increases as nutrient concentrations decrease
- K_M controls how quickly mortality increases with nutrient depletion

This dual mortality response creates important feedbacks between nutrient availability and population dynamics at multiple trophic levels.
