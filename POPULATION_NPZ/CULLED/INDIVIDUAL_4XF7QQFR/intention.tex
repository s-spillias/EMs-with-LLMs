This model enhancement incorporates nutrient-dependent photosynthetic efficiency, representing how nutrient limitation affects light utilization in photosynthesis. The new parameter phi_max represents the maximum achievable photosynthetic efficiency when nutrients are not limiting.

The photosynthetic efficiency (phi) varies linearly with the internal nutrient quota (Q), scaled between Q_min and Q_max. This reflects the biological reality that nutrient-stressed cells have reduced capacity to build and maintain photosynthetic machinery, particularly the nitrogen-rich proteins involved in light harvesting and carbon fixation.

This mechanism creates an important feedback where nutrient limitation not only affects growth directly through the Droop equation, but also indirectly by reducing the efficiency of light utilization. This better captures the multiple ways that nutrient stress impacts phytoplankton physiology and should improve the model's ability to reproduce observed dynamics, particularly during transitions between nutrient-replete and nutrient-limited conditions.
