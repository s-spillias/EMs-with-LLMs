\section{Model Enhancement: Temperature-Dependent Growth Efficiency}

We enhance the ecological model by incorporating temperature-dependent growth efficiency for phytoplankton. This addition reflects the well-documented relationship between temperature and photosynthetic efficiency in marine ecosystems. Many phytoplankton species show optimal growth within specific temperature ranges, with reduced efficiency at both higher and lower temperatures.

The modified model includes a temperature-dependent growth efficiency factor (E_T) that modulates the maximum growth rate (r_max). This factor follows a Gaussian-like curve centered around an optimal temperature (T_opt), with width controlled by the temperature sensitivity parameter (T_w).

This mechanism better represents:
1. The physiological constraints on phytoplankton growth across temperature gradients
2. Seasonal variations in primary productivity
3. The coupling between environmental conditions and population dynamics

The temperature dependence is implemented as:
E_T = exp(-((T - T_opt)^2)/(2 * T_w^2))

This formulation creates a smooth transition in growth efficiency across temperatures, with maximum efficiency at T_opt.
