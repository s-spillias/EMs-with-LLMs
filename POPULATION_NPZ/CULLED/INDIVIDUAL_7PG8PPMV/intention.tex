\section{Model Enhancement: Light Limitation}

The original NPZ model has been enhanced to include light limitation effects on phytoplankton growth. This modification addresses a key environmental driver of phytoplankton dynamics that was previously missing from the model.

\subsection{Ecological Justification}
Light availability is crucial for photosynthesis and therefore directly impacts phytoplankton growth. As phytoplankton populations increase, they create self-shading effects that can limit light penetration to deeper waters, creating a natural negative feedback mechanism. This addition helps explain:

1. The observed limitation in peak phytoplankton biomass
2. More realistic nutrient uptake patterns
3. Better representation of the system's carrying capacity

\subsection{Mathematical Implementation}
The light limitation is implemented using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Beer-Lambert law for light attenuation: $I = I_0 e^{-P}$
    \item Michaelis-Menten kinetics for light limitation: $f(I) = \frac{I}{K_I + I}$
    \item Combined with existing nutrient limitation: $\text{Growth} = r_{max} \cdot \frac{N}{K_N + N} \cdot \frac{I}{K_I + I} \cdot P$
\end{itemize}

This formulation creates a more mechanistic representation of phytoplankton growth limitations, potentially improving the model's ability to capture observed patterns in the data.
