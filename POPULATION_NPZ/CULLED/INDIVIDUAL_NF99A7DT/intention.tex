\section{Nutrient-Dependent Growth Efficiency}

We enhance the model by incorporating nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency. This modification reflects the biological reality that phytoplankton can adjust their photosynthetic machinery and resource allocation based on nutrient availability.

The growth efficiency term $\eta_N = 1 + \eta_{max} \frac{N}{N + K_N}$ represents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Baseline efficiency (1.0) under nutrient-limited conditions
    \item Additional efficiency ($\eta_{max}$) that scales with nutrient availability
    \item Uses the same half-saturation constant $K_N$ as nutrient uptake
\end{itemize}

This mechanism captures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhanced photosynthetic capacity when nutrients are abundant
    \item Reduced efficiency under nutrient stress
    \item Smooth transition between these states
\end{itemize}

The modification should improve the model's ability to capture:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Higher phytoplankton peaks under favorable conditions
    \item More realistic nutrient-growth relationships
    \item Cascading effects on zooplankton dynamics
\end{itemize}
