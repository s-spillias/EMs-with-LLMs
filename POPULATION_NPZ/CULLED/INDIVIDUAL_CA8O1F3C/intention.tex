This model incorporates density-dependent nutrient uptake efficiency for phytoplankton populations. Under nutrient limitation, phytoplankton can modify their uptake strategies through various mechanisms like increasing transporter proteins or altering cell surface area to volume ratios. This adaptive response is represented as a function of both ambient nutrient concentration and phytoplankton density.

The uptake efficiency (eta_N) now includes a density-dependent term that captures how phytoplankton populations optimize their nutrient acquisition strategies based on both resource availability and competition intensity. This better represents the biological reality where cells can adjust their uptake mechanisms but face increased competition at higher population densities.

The modified uptake efficiency equation is:
eta_N = eta_base + (eta_max - eta_base) / (1 + exp(-k_eta * (N - N_crit))) * (1 / (1 + k_dd * P))

where k_dd is a new density-dependence coefficient that reduces uptake efficiency as population density increases, reflecting increased competition for nutrients.
