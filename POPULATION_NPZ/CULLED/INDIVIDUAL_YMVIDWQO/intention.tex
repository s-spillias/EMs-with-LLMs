\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Assimilation Efficiency}

We enhance the ecological model by incorporating nutrient-dependent zooplankton assimilation efficiency. This modification reflects the biological reality that zooplankton growth efficiency typically decreases under nutrient-limited conditions, as:

1. Lower nutrient content in phytoplankton prey reduces their nutritional value
2. Zooplankton must expend more energy processing nutrient-poor food
3. Stoichiometric constraints limit consumer growth when prey have suboptimal nutrient ratios

The assimilation efficiency ($\alpha$) now varies with ambient nutrient concentration:

$\alpha_{effective} = \alpha_{max} \frac{N^2}{K_N^2 + N^2}$

where:
- $\alpha_{max}$ is the maximum assimilation efficiency under nutrient-replete conditions
- $N$ is the ambient nutrient concentration
- $K_N$ is the half-saturation constant for nutrient limitation

This formulation creates a smooth transition between low efficiency under nutrient limitation and maximum efficiency under nutrient-replete conditions, better capturing the observed system dynamics.
