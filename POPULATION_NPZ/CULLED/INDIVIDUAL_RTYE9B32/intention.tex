This model incorporates nutrient-dependent phytoplankton mortality to better represent physiological stress under nutrient limitation. When nutrients become scarce, phytoplankton experience increased mortality due to:

1. Reduced cellular maintenance capabilities
2. Increased susceptibility to viral lysis
3. Greater sensitivity to other environmental stressors

The mortality term m_P is modified to include both baseline mortality and an additional nutrient-dependent term:
mortality = m_P * P + m_P_N * P * (K_N/(N + K_N))

This formulation increases mortality when nutrient concentrations are low (N << K_N), helping capture the rapid decline in phytoplankton populations observed after bloom periods.
