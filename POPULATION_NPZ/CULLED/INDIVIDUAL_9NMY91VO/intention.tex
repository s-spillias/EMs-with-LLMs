\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Recycling}

We enhanced the ecological model by implementing nutrient-dependent recycling efficiency. This modification reflects the biological reality that nutrient availability affects microbial decomposition rates and nutrient regeneration processes.

The original model used a constant recycling fraction ($\gamma$), which oversimplified the relationship between nutrient availability and decomposition efficiency. In natural systems, nutrient limitation can impair microbial decomposition processes, resulting in less efficient nutrient recycling when nutrients are scarce.

The new formulation uses a Monod-type equation to make recycling efficiency dependent on ambient nutrient concentration:

\[ \gamma(N) = \gamma_{max} \frac{N}{K_R + N} \]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\gamma_{max}$ is the maximum recycling efficiency
    \item $K_R$ is the half-saturation constant for nutrient-dependent recycling
    \item $N$ is the ambient nutrient concentration
\end{itemize}

This modification creates a feedback loop where low nutrient conditions reduce recycling efficiency, potentially explaining the observed initial dynamics in the system where nutrient regeneration appears to be limited.
