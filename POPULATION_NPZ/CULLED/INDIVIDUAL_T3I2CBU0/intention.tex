\section{Model Enhancement: Phytoplankton Self-Shading}

We enhance the ecological realism of the model by incorporating phytoplankton self-shading effects. In natural aquatic systems, high phytoplankton concentrations create a negative feedback by reducing light penetration through the water column. This mechanism helps regulate phytoplankton blooms and influences the temporal dynamics of plankton populations.

The light limitation factor now includes both the baseline light attenuation and a term proportional to phytoplankton biomass:

\[ I_{effective} = I_0 \exp(-k_w P) \]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $I_0$ is the surface light intensity
    \item $k_w$ is the light attenuation coefficient due to phytoplankton
    \item $P$ is the phytoplankton biomass
\end{itemize}

This modification creates a density-dependent feedback that should better capture the observed dynamics, particularly during bloom periods.
