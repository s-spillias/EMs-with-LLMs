This model incorporates nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency to better represent physiological adaptations to resource limitation. When nutrients become scarce, phytoplankton can enhance their growth efficiency through mechanisms like:

1. Upregulation of nutrient transporters
2. Modification of cellular nutrient quotas
3. Increased resource use efficiency
4. Altered metabolic pathways

The enhancement is modeled as:
gamma = 1 + gamma_max * (K_N / (N + K_N)) * (N / (N + K_gamma))

This formulation ensures that:
- Enhancement increases as nutrients become limiting (first term)
- Enhancement requires some minimal nutrient availability (second term)
- Enhancement is bounded between 1 and (1 + gamma_max)

This mechanism allows phytoplankton to maintain higher growth rates under moderate nutrient limitation, potentially explaining the higher observed biomass peaks and subsequent effects on zooplankton dynamics.
