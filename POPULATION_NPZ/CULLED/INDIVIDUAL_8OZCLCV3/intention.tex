This model enhancement incorporates nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency through the addition of the eta parameter. The modification reflects the ecological principle that phytoplankton can optimize their growth efficiency when nutrients are abundant.

The growth efficiency term (1 + eta * N/(K_N + N)) increases the effective growth rate when nutrients are plentiful, representing:
1. Enhanced photosynthetic efficiency under good nutrient conditions
2. More efficient nutrient uptake mechanisms when resources are abundant
3. Reduced metabolic costs when nutrients are easily accessible

This addition aims to better capture the observed rapid population growth during nutrient-rich periods while maintaining reasonable behavior during nutrient-limited conditions. The formulation ensures that growth efficiency smoothly transitions between baseline (eta=0) and maximum (eta>0) efficiency states based on nutrient availability.
