\section{Ecological Mechanism: Variable Nutrient Storage}

The model has been enhanced to include variable internal nutrient storage in phytoplankton, representing a key physiological adaptation observed in nature. This mechanism, known as "luxury uptake", allows phytoplankton to store excess nutrients when they are abundant and utilize these reserves during periods of scarcity.

The implementation uses a quota-based approach where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Q represents the cellular nutrient:carbon ratio
    \item Q\_min is the minimum quota needed for survival
    \item Q\_max is the maximum storage capacity
    \item Uptake rate is regulated by current quota status
    \item Growth rate depends on internal quota rather than external nutrients
\end{itemize}

This better captures how phytoplankton can maintain growth during temporary nutrient depletion and explains the observed rapid bloom development when nutrients become available. The mechanism provides a more realistic representation of nutrient-phytoplankton dynamics, particularly during transition periods between high and low nutrient conditions.
