This model incorporates luxury nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, an important ecological mechanism where cells can store excess nutrients when they are abundant. This storage strategy provides a competitive advantage by allowing continued growth when external nutrients become scarce.

The luxury uptake mechanism is implemented through:
1. A maximum internal nutrient quota (Q_max)
2. A minimum quota needed for growth (Q_min) 
3. Variable uptake rates based on current quota status
4. Growth rates that depend on internal rather than external nutrient concentrations

This better represents how phytoplankton actually respond to nutrient availability in nature, where internal storage can buffer against environmental variability and create more realistic bloom dynamics.
