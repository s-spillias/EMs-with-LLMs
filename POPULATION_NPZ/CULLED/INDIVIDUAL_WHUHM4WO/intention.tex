This model enhancement introduces phosphorus as a second limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth, implementing Liebig's Law of the Minimum. In many marine ecosystems, both nitrogen and phosphorus can limit primary production at different times or simultaneously. The modified model:

1. Adds phosphorus (P_i) as a state variable
2. Implements Liebig's Law to determine the most limiting nutrient
3. Maintains mass balance for both N and P cycles
4. Uses realistic N:P ratios based on Redfield stoichiometry

This change should improve the model's ability to capture:
- Resource limitation dynamics
- Seasonal succession patterns
- Peak biomass limitations
- Nutrient cycling feedbacks
