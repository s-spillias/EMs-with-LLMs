This model enhancement implements variable internal nutrient storage (quota) in phytoplankton, representing luxury uptake dynamics. This better captures how phytoplankton can:

1. Store excess nutrients when they are abundant
2. Continue growing using stored nutrients when external nutrients become scarce
3. Exhibit variable nutrient uptake rates based on their internal stores

The key equations modified/added are:

- Separate equations for nutrient uptake and growth, rather than coupling them directly
- Growth rate depends on internal quota (Droop equation)
- Uptake rate varies with both external nutrients and internal quota (feedback regulation)

This mechanism helps explain the observed phase relationships between nutrients and biomass, as phytoplankton can maintain growth even after external nutrients are depleted. It also provides a more mechanistic representation of how nutrient limitation affects phytoplankton physiology and population dynamics.
