\section{Model Enhancement: Light Limitation}

We enhanced the ecological model by incorporating light limitation effects on phytoplankton growth. This addition better represents the seasonal dynamics often observed in marine ecosystems. The key modifications include:

\subsection{Light Limitation Implementation}
We introduced a simplified seasonal light cycle using a sinusoidal function with an annual period. The relative light intensity (I\_rel) varies between 0 and 1 throughout the year. The uptake rate is then modified by a Michaelis-Menten type light limitation term:

\[ I_{rel} = 0.5(1 + \sin(2\pi t/365)) \]
\[ f(I) = \frac{I_{rel}}{K_I + I_{rel}} \]

where K\_I is the half-saturation constant for light limitation.

\subsection{Ecological Justification}
Phytoplankton growth is fundamentally dependent on light availability for photosynthesis. By including this mechanism, we can better capture:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Seasonal variations in primary productivity
    \item Bottom-up control of ecosystem dynamics
    \item More realistic nutrient-phytoplankton coupling
\end{itemize}

This modification should improve the model's ability to reproduce observed patterns, particularly the longer-term oscillations visible in the historical data.
