This model enhancement introduces nutrient-dependent phytoplankton mortality to better capture the dynamics of phytoplankton populations under nutrient stress. When nutrients become scarce, phytoplankton experience increased mortality rates due to:

1. Reduced cell maintenance capability
2. Increased susceptibility to viral lysis
3. Enhanced programmed cell death

The modified mortality term uses a Monod-type function where mortality increases as nutrient concentrations decrease, representing these combined stress effects. This mechanism is particularly important in oligotrophic conditions and helps explain the rapid population declines observed in the historical data when nutrients become limiting.
