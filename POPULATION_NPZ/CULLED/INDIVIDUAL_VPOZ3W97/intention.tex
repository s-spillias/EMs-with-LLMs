\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Zooplankton Assimilation}

This modification implements a variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency that depends on the nutrient:phytoplankton ratio. The ecological reasoning is that phytoplankton with higher nutrient content (higher N:P ratio) provide better food quality for zooplankton, improving their growth efficiency.

The assimilation efficiency α now varies according to:
α_effective = α_base * (1 + α_slope * N/P)

This represents:
- Higher assimilation when nutrients are abundant relative to phytoplankton
- Reduced efficiency when phytoplankton are nutrient-limited
- A baseline efficiency (α_base) modified by the N:P ratio
- α_slope controls sensitivity to nutrient conditions

This mechanism creates an important feedback where zooplankton growth depends not just on prey quantity but also quality, which better reflects real marine ecosystem dynamics.
