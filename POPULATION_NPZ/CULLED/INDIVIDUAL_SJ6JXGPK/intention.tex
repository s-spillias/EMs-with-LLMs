This model enhancement introduces temperature-dependent growth optimization for phytoplankton communities. The previous Arrhenius equation assumed a monotonic increase in metabolic rates with temperature, which doesn't capture the reality that phytoplankton species often have optimal temperature ranges for growth.

The new implementation uses a Gaussian response curve centered around an optimal temperature (T_opt_C). This better represents how phytoplankton growth efficiency peaks at their adapted temperature and declines at both higher and lower temperatures. The temperature tolerance parameter (T_tol) defines the width of this optimal range.

This mechanistic change is ecologically justified because:
1. Phytoplankton communities show clear thermal optima in nature
2. Temperature adaptation is a key trait structuring marine communities
3. Growth efficiency typically shows a unimodal response to temperature
4. Seasonal temperature variations can drive succession patterns

The modification should improve the model's ability to capture:
- Seasonal growth patterns
- The magnitude of bloom events
- Community adaptation to local temperature regimes
