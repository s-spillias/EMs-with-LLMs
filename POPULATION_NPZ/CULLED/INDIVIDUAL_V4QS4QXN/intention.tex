This model enhancement implements variable internal nutrient storage in phytoplankton, known as luxury uptake. This ecological mechanism allows phytoplankton to store excess nutrients when they are abundant and continue growing when external nutrients become scarce. The implementation follows Droop's cell quota model, where growth depends on internal rather than external nutrient concentrations.

Key ecological processes captured:
1. Decoupling of nutrient uptake from growth
2. Variable uptake rates based on internal stores
3. Growth limitation based on internal quota rather than external concentration
4. More realistic nutrient-limited growth dynamics

The modified equations represent:
- Internal quota (Q) dynamics: dQ/dt = V(N,Q) - μ(Q)Q
- Growth rate: μ = r_max * (1 - Q_min/Q)
- Uptake rate: V = V_max * (1 - Q/Q_max) * N/(K_N + N)

This better captures the observed lag between nutrient depletion and growth reduction, and allows for more realistic bloom dynamics.
