This model enhancement introduces nutrient-dependent mortality for phytoplankton populations. 
The modification reflects that phytoplankton experience increased mortality under nutrient-limited conditions, 
a well-documented phenomenon in marine ecosystems. The additional mortality term (m_N) scales inversely 
with nutrient availability, representing increased cell death and autolysis under nutrient stress.

This mechanism helps explain the rapid population crashes observed in the historical data when nutrients 
become depleted, improving the model's ability to capture the sharp transitions in population dynamics.
