\section{Model Description}

This model incorporates nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency to better represent how phytoplankton adapt to varying nutrient conditions. Under nutrient stress, many phytoplankton species can increase their nutrient use efficiency through various physiological adaptations like increasing surface-to-volume ratios or expressing different nutrient transporters.

The growth efficiency term ($\eta_N$) is modeled as:

\[ \eta_N = \eta_{base} + \eta_{max} \frac{N}{N + K_{\eta}} \]

where $\eta_{base}$ is the baseline efficiency, $\eta_{max}$ is the maximum additional efficiency possible under optimal nutrient conditions, and $K_{\eta}$ is the half-saturation constant for this response.

This mechanism allows phytoplankton to maintain higher growth rates under moderate nutrient limitation, while still being constrained under severe nutrient depletion. This better reflects the observed patterns in the data where phytoplankton show more gradual responses to changing nutrient levels than predicted by simple Monod kinetics alone.
