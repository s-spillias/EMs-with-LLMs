    "qualitative_description": "The model shows a sophisticated and enhanced version of the standard NPZ model, with additional complexity in temperature scaling, light limitation, and nutrient-dependent processes. While the core mathematical structure is similar, some specific NPZ equation components are implemented with more nuanced approaches.",

      "nutrient_equation_uptake": {
        "score": 0.8,
        "explanation": "Includes Michaelis-Menten kinetics (N/(K_N+N)) with temperature and light scaling. Self-shading is implemented via light attenuation (exp(-k_w * P)). Slightly more complex than standard formulation."

      "nutrient_equation_recycling": {
        "score": 0.6,
        "explanation": "Recycling terms are present but not in the exact specified form. Detritus remineralization (r_D * temp_scale * D) replaces the explicit zooplankton recycling terms. Lacks direct beta*lambda*P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z and gamma*q*Z terms."

        "score": 0.8,
