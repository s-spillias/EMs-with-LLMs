\section{Model Description}

This ecological model incorporates nutrient-dependent zooplankton feeding efficiency to better represent trophic transfer dynamics. The key modification is making zooplankton assimilation efficiency (α) dependent on phytoplankton nutrient status:

α_effective = α_base * (N/(K_N + N))

This formulation captures that:
1. Nutrient-stressed phytoplankton are lower quality prey
2. Zooplankton growth efficiency improves with better-nourished prey
3. The effect saturates at high nutrient levels

This mechanism helps explain the observed strong coupling between nutrient availability and zooplankton population peaks in marine systems. When nutrients are abundant, phytoplankton can maintain higher nutrient content, allowing more efficient energy transfer to zooplankton.
