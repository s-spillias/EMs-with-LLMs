This model enhancement adds internal nutrient storage in phytoplankton cells, a key physiological adaptation observed in marine systems. The storage mechanism is implemented through a variable quota model where:

1. Nutrient uptake and growth are decoupled - cells can take up nutrients faster than needed for immediate growth
2. Maximum storage capacity (Q_max) limits excessive accumulation
3. Growth rate depends on internal rather than external nutrient concentration
4. Uptake rate decreases as cells approach storage capacity (feedback control)

This better represents how phytoplankton buffer against nutrient fluctuations and helps explain the observed lag between nutrient availability and population response. The mechanism is particularly important in dynamic environments where nutrient supply is variable.
