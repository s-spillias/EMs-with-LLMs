This model incorporates temperature dependence of biological rates using the Arrhenius equation:

rate = rate_ref * exp(E_a/k_B * (1/T_ref - 1/T))

where:
- E_a is the activation energy (eV)
- k_B is the Boltzmann constant
- T_ref is the reference temperature (Kelvin)
- T is the ambient temperature (Kelvin)

This modification recognizes that metabolic processes like photosynthesis, grazing, and mortality are fundamentally temperature-dependent. The Arrhenius relationship is well-established in metabolic theory and helps explain seasonal and spatial variations in plankton dynamics.

The temperature dependence affects:
1. Phytoplankton growth (r_max)
2. Zooplankton grazing (g_max)
3. Mortality rates (m_P, m_Z)

This should better capture the timing and magnitude of population changes, especially during seasonal transitions.
