This model enhancement incorporates phytoplankton nutrient storage (luxury uptake) dynamics, which is a well-documented ecological process where phytoplankton can accumulate nutrients beyond their immediate growth requirements when nutrients are abundant. This stored pool can later support growth when external nutrients become scarce.

The implementation uses Droop's cell quota model framework, where growth depends on internal nutrient status (Q) rather than external nutrient concentration. Key equations:

1. Nutrient uptake rate = f(external N, Q_max - Q) 
   - Uptake slows as internal stores approach maximum capacity
   - Maintains mass balance

2. Growth rate = r_max * (Q - Q_min)/(Q - Q_min + K_Q)
   - Growth depends on how much internal nutrient content exceeds minimum requirements
   - Allows continued growth for some time after external nutrients are depleted

This better represents the temporal decoupling between nutrient uptake and growth that occurs in natural systems, potentially explaining the observed lag between nutrient depletion and biomass peaks.
