This model enhancement incorporates variable internal nutrient quotas in phytoplankton, representing their ability to maintain growth under nutrient limitation through flexible stoichiometry. The key additions are:

1. A new state variable Q representing the internal nutrient:carbon ratio of phytoplankton
2. Modified uptake equations that separate nutrient uptake from carbon fixation
3. Growth limitation based on internal rather than external nutrient concentration
4. Variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency based on prey nutrient content

This better captures:
- Luxury uptake and storage of nutrients by phytoplankton
- Continued (but reduced) growth under nutrient limitation
- Variable nutritional quality effects on higher trophic levels
- More realistic time delays in nutrient limitation effects

These mechanisms are well-documented in marine systems and help explain the observed phase relationships between nutrients, phytoplankton, and zooplankton.
