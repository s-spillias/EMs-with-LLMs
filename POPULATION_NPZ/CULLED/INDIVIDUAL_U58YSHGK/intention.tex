\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Zooplankton Mortality}

We enhanced the ecological model by incorporating nutrient-dependent zooplankton mortality. This modification reflects the biological reality that zooplankton populations experience higher mortality rates under nutrient-poor conditions, due to:

1. Reduced food quality when phytoplankton are nutrient-limited
2. Increased metabolic costs of finding food in low-productivity environments
3. Reduced energy available for predator defense and immune function

The zooplankton mortality term was modified from a simple quadratic form ($m_Z Z^2$) to:

$m_Z \frac{Z^2}{1 + N/(K_N)}$

This formulation increases mortality when ambient nutrient concentrations (N) are low relative to the half-saturation constant ($K_N$). When nutrients are abundant, the mortality rate approaches the base rate $m_Z Z^2$. This creates a stabilizing feedback that prevents zooplankton from persisting at unrealistically high levels when the system becomes nutrient-depleted.
