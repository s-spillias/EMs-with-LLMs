This model enhancement implements luxury uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton, where cells can store excess nutrients internally when they are abundant and use these stores to maintain growth when external nutrients become scarce. This better represents the physiological adaptations of phytoplankton to variable nutrient environments.

The key additions are:
1. Internal nutrient quota (Q) bounded by Q_min and Q_max
2. Droop equation relating growth to internal rather than external nutrients
3. Regulated uptake that slows as cells approach their maximum quota

This mechanism allows phytoplankton to:
- Buffer against nutrient fluctuations through storage
- Maintain growth temporarily during nutrient limitation
- Decouple nutrient uptake from growth

These changes should improve the model's ability to capture:
- Higher peak phytoplankton biomass through stored nutrients
- More realistic nutrient-growth relationships
- Better timing of population dynamics
