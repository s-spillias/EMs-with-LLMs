This model enhancement introduces temperature-dependent zooplankton grazing efficiency. The modification is based on the metabolic theory of ecology, which predicts that biological rates including feeding efficiency scale with temperature following an Arrhenius relationship.

The new parameter E_g represents the activation energy for grazing efficiency, with a value of 0.55 eV that falls within the typical range for biological processes (0.5-0.7 eV). This creates a temperature scaling factor that modifies the nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency (alpha_N).

The temperature dependence is implemented as a multiplier on the existing nutrient-dependent efficiency term. This maintains the nutrient limitation effects while adding temperature modulation. The scaling is bounded between 0.5-1.5Ã— to prevent extreme values.

This change better represents the physiological constraints on zooplankton feeding, as their ability to efficiently process consumed phytoplankton depends on both nutrient availability and temperature-dependent metabolic processes. The modification should help capture observed patterns in zooplankton abundance, particularly during warmer periods when metabolic rates and feeding efficiency may be enhanced.
