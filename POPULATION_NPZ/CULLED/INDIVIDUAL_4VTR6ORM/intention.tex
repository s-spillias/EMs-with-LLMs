This model incorporates nutrient-dependent phytoplankton sinking as a key ecological process. Under nutrient stress, many phytoplankton species alter their cellular composition and density, leading to increased sinking rates. This represents an important feedback mechanism where nutrient limitation not only reduces growth but also accelerates the loss of phytoplankton from the surface mixed layer.

The sinking rate is modeled as:
sinking = (s_P + s_P_max * K_N/(N + K_N)) * P

where:
- s_P is the base sinking rate under nutrient-replete conditions
- s_P_max is the maximum additional sinking under nutrient stress
- K_N/(N + K_N) scales the additional sinking from 0 (high nutrients) to 1 (severe limitation)

This mechanism creates a stronger coupling between nutrients and phytoplankton dynamics, potentially improving the model's ability to capture observed oscillations and phase relationships in the NPZ system.
