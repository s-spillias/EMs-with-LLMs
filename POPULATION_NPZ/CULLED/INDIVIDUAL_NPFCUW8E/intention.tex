This model enhancement incorporates photoinhibition effects on phytoplankton growth through the addition of a photoinhibition term in the light limitation function. The modified equation better represents the physiological response of phytoplankton to high light intensities, where excessive light can damage photosynthetic machinery and reduce growth efficiency.

The new light limitation factor includes:
1. Standard light limitation (effective_light/I_opt)
2. Optimal light adaptation (exp(1 - effective_light/I_opt))
3. Photoinhibition term (-beta_I * (effective_light - I_opt)) that only activates when light exceeds optimal levels

This mechanism helps explain the observed mismatch between modeled and historical phytoplankton peaks, as excessive light during summer can limit maximum bloom intensity. The photoinhibition coefficient beta_I is based on empirical studies of marine phytoplankton photophysiology.
