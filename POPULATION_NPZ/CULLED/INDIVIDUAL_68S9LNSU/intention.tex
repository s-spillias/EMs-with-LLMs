\section{Temperature Dependence Implementation}

This model enhancement implements temperature-dependent biological rates using the Arrhenius equation:

\[ f(T) = e^{\frac{-E_a}{k} (\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_{ref}})} \]

where:
- $E_a$ is the activation energy (eV)
- $k$ is the Boltzmann constant (eV/K)
- $T$ is the temperature (K)
- $T_{ref}$ is the reference temperature (K)

This scaling factor affects growth, grazing, and mortality rates since these biological processes are fundamentally controlled by temperature-dependent metabolic rates. The activation energy $E_a$ represents the temperature sensitivity of these processes, while $T_{ref}$ sets the baseline temperature at which the nominal rates apply.

The implementation uses realistic values from the metabolic theory of ecology, with $E_a \approx 0.63$ eV being typical for photosynthesis and other biological rates in marine systems (Brown et al., 2004).

This modification should help capture seasonal and long-term variations in plankton dynamics that are driven by temperature changes in marine ecosystems.
