This model enhancement introduces nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency (eta_N) to better capture adaptive responses to nutrient limitation. The efficiency term eta_N increases as nutrient concentrations decrease, representing:

1. Physiological adaptations where phytoplankton become more efficient at nutrient uptake and utilization under limitation
2. Changes in community composition toward species better adapted to low nutrient conditions
3. More efficient internal recycling of nutrients within cells

The functional form eta_N = 1 + eta_max * K_N/(N + K_N) ensures:
- Baseline efficiency (eta_N = 1) under nutrient-replete conditions
- Increased efficiency (up to 1 + eta_max) under nutrient limitation
- Smooth transition using the same half-saturation constant K_N as nutrient uptake

This mechanism provides a key negative feedback that helps stabilize phytoplankton populations under nutrient stress, potentially improving the fit to observed dynamics.
