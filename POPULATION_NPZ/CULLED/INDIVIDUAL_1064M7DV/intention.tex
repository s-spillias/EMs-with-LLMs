\section{Model Modifications}

We enhanced the ecological model by incorporating nutrient-dependent zooplankton assimilation efficiency. This modification reflects that zooplankton feeding efficiency typically decreases in nutrient-poor environments, as:

1. Lower nutrient concentrations often indicate lower-quality phytoplankton prey
2. Zooplankton must expend more energy to process and extract nutrients from nutrient-deficient prey
3. This creates an important feedback loop between nutrient availability and trophic transfer efficiency

The assimilation efficiency α is now modeled as:

α_effective = α_base * N/(K_N + N)

where:
- α_base is the maximum assimilation efficiency (original α parameter)
- N is the nutrient concentration
- K_N is the half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake

This formulation ensures that:
- Assimilation efficiency approaches α_base when nutrients are abundant
- Efficiency decreases when nutrients are scarce
- The relationship follows established nutrient limitation kinetics
