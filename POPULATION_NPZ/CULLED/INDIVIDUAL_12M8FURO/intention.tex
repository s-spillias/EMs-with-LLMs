This model enhancement introduces nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency (η). The efficiency of nutrient uptake and conversion to biomass is not constant but varies with nutrient availability:

η(N) = η_base + η_max * (N / (N + K_η))

where:
- η_base is the baseline efficiency under nutrient-limited conditions
- η_max is the maximum additional efficiency possible
- K_η is the half-saturation constant for this relationship
- N is the nutrient concentration

This mechanism reflects that phytoplankton can optimize their nutrient utilization when resources are abundant, leading to more efficient growth. Under nutrient-limited conditions, they maintain a baseline efficiency (η_base) but cannot achieve their maximum potential growth efficiency.

The modification affects the nutrient uptake term in the model:
uptake = r_max * temp_scale * light_limitation * η(N) * N * P / (K_N + N)

This better captures the physiological response of phytoplankton to varying nutrient conditions, potentially explaining the observed peaks in biomass when conditions are favorable.
