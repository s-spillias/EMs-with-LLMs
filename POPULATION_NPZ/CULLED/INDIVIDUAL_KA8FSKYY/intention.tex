This model enhancement incorporates phytoplankton nutrient storage (luxury uptake) dynamics. 
In nature, phytoplankton can take up excess nutrients when available and store them for later use, 
decoupling nutrient uptake from growth. This provides a competitive advantage during nutrient-poor periods 
and better captures the lag between nutrient depletion and biomass decline.

The model now tracks internal nutrient quota Q (g N/g C) in addition to external nutrients. 
Nutrient uptake depends on both external nutrient concentration and current storage status (Q_max - Q), 
while growth rate depends on internal quota rather than external nutrients. This creates a more realistic 
two-step process: 1) nutrient uptake into storage, 2) growth using stored nutrients.

This mechanism should improve prediction of phytoplankton peaks and subsequent zooplankton dynamics by 
allowing phytoplankton to better utilize nutrient pulses through temporary storage.
