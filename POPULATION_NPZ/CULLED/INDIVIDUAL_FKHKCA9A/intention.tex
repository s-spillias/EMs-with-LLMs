\section{Model Enhancement: Temperature-Dependent Metabolic Scaling}

We enhanced the NPZ model by incorporating temperature dependence of key biological rates using the Arrhenius equation. This modification reflects the fundamental influence of temperature on metabolic processes in marine ecosystems.

\subsection{Ecological Justification}
Temperature is a master variable that controls the rates of biochemical reactions and consequently affects growth, grazing, and other metabolic processes. The Arrhenius equation provides a mechanistic basis for modeling this temperature dependence:

\[ \text{Rate}(T) = \text{Rate}(T_{\text{ref}}) \exp\left(\frac{E_a}{k_B}\left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{ref}}}-\frac{1}{T}\right)\right) \]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E_a$ is the activation energy (eV)
    \item $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant
    \item $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin
    \item $T_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference temperature
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation}
We applied temperature scaling to both phytoplankton growth ($r_{\text{max}}$) and zooplankton grazing ($g_{\text{max}}$) rates, as these processes are directly linked to metabolic activity. The scaling preserves the original model structure while adding mechanistic temperature dependence.

This modification should improve the model's ability to capture temporal variations in plankton dynamics, particularly when temperature fluctuations drive changes in biological rates.
