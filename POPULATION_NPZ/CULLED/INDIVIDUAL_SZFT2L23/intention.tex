\section{Variable Nutrient Storage Model}

This model enhancement incorporates variable internal nutrient storage by phytoplankton, known as luxury uptake. This mechanism is based on Droop's cell quota model, where growth depends on the internal nutrient content rather than external concentrations.

Key ecological implications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phytoplankton can store excess nutrients when available, creating a buffer against future limitation
    \item Growth rate depends on internal rather than external nutrient status, allowing continued growth even when external nutrients are depleted
    \item Uptake rate varies with both external concentration and internal quota, representing physiological regulation
    \item This mechanism can help explain time lags between nutrient availability and population growth
\end{itemize}

The internal quota Q varies between Q\_min (minimum for survival) and Q\_max (storage capacity). Growth rate increases with Q but saturates, while uptake rate decreases as Q approaches Q\_max, representing down-regulation of uptake systems.
