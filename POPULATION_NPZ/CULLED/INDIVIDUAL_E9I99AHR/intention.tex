This model enhancement incorporates density-dependent grazing efficiency to better represent zooplankton feeding dynamics. The modification adds a reduction term φ that decreases grazing efficiency as phytoplankton density increases beyond an optimal level.

The functional form φ = 1 - φ_max * P/(P + P_opt) ensures that:
1. At low phytoplankton densities (P << P_opt), grazing efficiency remains near maximum (φ ≈ 1)
2. As P increases beyond P_opt, efficiency decreases asymptotically toward (1 - φ_max)
3. The transition is smooth and biologically realistic

This mechanism represents several ecological processes:
- Mechanical interference in feeding at high prey densities
- Physiological limitations in processing very abundant food
- Reduced capture efficiency when prey is too dense

The modification helps explain why zooplankton may not control phytoplankton blooms as effectively as simple prey-dependent functional responses would suggest, potentially improving the fit to observed bloom dynamics.
