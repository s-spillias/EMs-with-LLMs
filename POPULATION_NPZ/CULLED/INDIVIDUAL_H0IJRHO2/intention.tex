This model enhancement introduces temperature-dependent nutrient assimilation efficiency for phytoplankton. While basic metabolic rates generally increase with temperature following Arrhenius kinetics, photosynthetic machinery and nutrient processing systems often have different temperature optima. This creates a dome-shaped response curve where efficiency peaks at an optimal temperature and declines at both higher and lower temperatures.

The modification uses a Gaussian function to model this temperature dependence:
temp_efficiency = exp(-(T - T_opt)^2 / (2 * T_width^2))

This better captures:
1. The existence of an optimal temperature (T_opt) for nutrient processing
2. Reduced efficiency at both low and high temperatures
3. The interaction between temperature and nutrient limitation

This mechanism helps explain the observed early-season dynamics where the original model underestimated peak phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations, likely due to oversimplified temperature effects on nutrient utilization.
