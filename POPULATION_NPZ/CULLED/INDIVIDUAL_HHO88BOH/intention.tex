This model enhancement introduces temperature-dependent photosynthetic efficiency for phytoplankton growth. While the base model already includes general metabolic temperature scaling, photosynthesis often shows distinct temperature responses due to the specialized biochemical machinery involved.

The modification adds a temperature optimum (T_opt) parameter and implements a bell-shaped temperature response curve that better captures:
1. Reduced efficiency at low temperatures due to slower enzyme kinetics
2. Peak efficiency near species-specific optimal temperatures 
3. Rapid decline above optimal temperatures due to enzyme denaturation and increased photorespiration

This mechanistic relationship should improve the model's ability to capture seasonal phytoplankton dynamics, particularly during spring blooms when temperature changes rapidly.
