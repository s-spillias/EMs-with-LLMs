\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Growth Efficiency}

We enhanced the ecological model by incorporating nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency. This modification addresses the observation that phytoplankton can adjust their photosynthetic efficiency based on ambient nutrient conditions, a well-documented phenomenon in marine ecosystems.

The enhancement adds two new parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\eta_{max}$: Maximum additional growth efficiency under optimal nutrient conditions
    \item $K_{\eta}$: Half-saturation constant for the nutrient-dependent efficiency response
\end{itemize}

The nutrient uptake term now includes an efficiency bonus factor:
$$ \eta_N = \frac{\eta_{max} N}{N + K_{\eta}} $$

This modifies the uptake rate to:
$$ uptake = r_{max}(1 + \eta_N) \cdot T_{scale} \cdot L_{limit} \cdot \frac{NP}{K_N + N} $$

This mechanism captures the ability of phytoplankton to optimize their growth efficiency when nutrients are abundant, while maintaining baseline growth under nutrient-limited conditions. The modification aims to better represent the observed peaks in phytoplankton biomass and subsequent effects on zooplankton dynamics.
