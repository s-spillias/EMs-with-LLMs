This model incorporates phytoplankton nutrient storage (luxury uptake) - a key physiological adaptation where cells can uptake excess nutrients when available and store them for later use. This mechanism is implemented through:

1. Separate equations for nutrient uptake and growth
2. Tracking internal nutrient quotas (Q)
3. Making growth dependent on internal rather than external nutrient concentration
4. Variable uptake rates based on internal quota status

This better represents how phytoplankton actually process nutrients in nature, allowing them to:
- Buffer against nutrient fluctuations
- Maintain growth when external nutrients become scarce
- Show more realistic bloom dynamics
- Better compete for pulsed nutrient inputs

The implementation uses the Droop equation for quota-dependent growth and regulated uptake based on internal stores.
