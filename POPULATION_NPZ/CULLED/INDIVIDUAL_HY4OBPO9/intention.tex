\section{Model Enhancement: Nutrient-Dependent Phytoplankton Growth Efficiency}

We enhanced the ecological model by incorporating nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency. This modification reflects the biological observation that phytoplankton can optimize their resource utilization under favorable nutrient conditions through various physiological adaptations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Increased enzyme production for nutrient processing
    \item Enhanced photosynthetic efficiency
    \item Optimized nutrient transport mechanisms
    \item Better resource allocation within cells
\end{itemize}

The enhancement is implemented through a Monod-type equation:
\[ \eta_N = 1 + \eta_{max} \frac{N}{N + K_{\eta}} \]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\eta_N$ is the nutrient-dependent efficiency multiplier
    \item $\eta_{max}$ is the maximum additional efficiency (0.3)
    \item $K_{\eta}$ is the half-saturation constant (0.15 g C m^{-3})
\end{itemize}

This mechanism allows phytoplankton growth to respond more dynamically to nutrient availability, potentially improving the model's ability to capture observed population dynamics, particularly during bloom periods.
