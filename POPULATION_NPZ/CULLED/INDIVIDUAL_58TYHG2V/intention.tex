\section{Model Description}

This ecological model incorporates light limitation of phytoplankton growth using a Monod-type response to seasonal irradiance. The light limitation factor (L) follows a sinusoidal pattern representing seasonal changes in daily light availability, with maximum irradiance occurring in summer months.

The phytoplankton growth rate is now co-limited by both nutrients (N) and light (L), following Liebig's law of the minimum. This better represents the reality that phytoplankton growth can be limited by either resource, depending on environmental conditions.

The addition of light limitation helps explain:
1. The timing and magnitude of spring phytoplankton blooms
2. Seasonal succession patterns
3. The vertical distribution of primary production

This mechanism is particularly important in temperate marine systems where seasonal light variation is a major driver of plankton dynamics.
