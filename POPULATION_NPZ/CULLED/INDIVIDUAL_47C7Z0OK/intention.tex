This model enhancement introduces temperature-dependent photosynthetic efficiency to better capture the physiological response of phytoplankton to environmental conditions. The modification adds a new parameter Q10_photo that represents the change in photosynthetic rate for every 10°C increase in temperature, following the Q10 temperature coefficient principle widely observed in biological systems.

The temperature dependence is implemented through a Q10-based scaling factor that modifies the maximum photosynthetic rate (r_max). This reflects the known relationship between temperature and photosynthetic enzyme kinetics, particularly the temperature sensitivity of RuBisCO activity.

The Q10 relationship is expressed as:
photo_temp_factor = Q10_photo^((T - T_ref)/10)

where T is the ambient temperature and T_ref is the reference temperature (20°C).

This mechanism provides a more mechanistic representation of how temperature influences phytoplankton growth, which is particularly important for capturing seasonal dynamics and responses to temperature variations.
