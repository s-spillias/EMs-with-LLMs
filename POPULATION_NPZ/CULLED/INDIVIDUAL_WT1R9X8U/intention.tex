This model enhancement introduces density-dependent competition effects in phytoplankton nutrient uptake. As phytoplankton density increases, cells begin to interfere with each other's ability to acquire nutrients through multiple mechanisms:

1. Physical interference between cells can reduce the effective surface area available for nutrient uptake
2. Dense populations create boundary layers that inhibit nutrient diffusion
3. Local depletion zones form around cells in dense populations

The competition effect is implemented using a density-dependent reduction factor in the nutrient uptake term:
competition_factor = 1 / (1 + c_P * P)

where c_P is the competition coefficient that determines how strongly phytoplankton density reduces uptake efficiency.

This mechanism provides negative feedback on phytoplankton growth at high densities, which better represents the physical and chemical constraints on nutrient acquisition in dense populations.
