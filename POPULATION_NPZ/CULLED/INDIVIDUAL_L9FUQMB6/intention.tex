This model enhancement introduces nutrient-dependent zooplankton mortality to better capture the complex relationships between nutrient availability and trophic interactions in marine ecosystems. The modification is based on the ecological understanding that nutrient limitation can affect not just primary producers, but also higher trophic levels through various physiological and behavioral mechanisms.

The new formulation makes zooplankton mortality rate inversely dependent on nutrient availability through a Monod-type relationship. When nutrients are scarce (N << K_Z), the effective mortality rate approaches the base rate m_Z. As nutrient levels increase, the mortality rate decreases, reflecting improved zooplankton survival under nutrient-rich conditions.

This mechanism represents several ecological processes:
1. Indirect effects of nutrient limitation on zooplankton food quality
2. Physiological stress under nutrient-poor conditions
3. Altered predator-prey interactions in nutrient-limited environments

The addition of K_Z parameter provides a threshold for these effects, making the model more mechanistically realistic while maintaining parsimony.
