This model incorporates nutrient-dependent phytoplankton uptake efficiency to better represent how phytoplankton adapt their nutrient acquisition strategies to environmental conditions. The uptake efficiency (η) varies with ambient nutrient concentration following a Monod-type relationship:

η = η_max * N / (K_η + N)

where η_max is the maximum uptake efficiency and K_η is the half-saturation constant for efficiency.

This mechanism captures several important ecological processes:
1. At low nutrient concentrations, uptake efficiency increases, representing enhanced nutrient acquisition strategies
2. At high concentrations, efficiency saturates, reflecting physiological limitations
3. The variable efficiency creates a more realistic coupling between nutrients and phytoplankton growth

This addition helps explain the observed dynamics by allowing phytoplankton to maintain growth under lower nutrient conditions, potentially improving the model's ability to capture bloom dynamics and subsequent ecosystem responses.
