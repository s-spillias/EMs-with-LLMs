This model incorporates nutrient-dependent phytoplankton mortality to better represent how nutrient limitation affects phytoplankton population dynamics. Under low nutrient conditions, phytoplankton experience increased mortality due to cellular stress and reduced ability to maintain essential functions. This mechanism is implemented as an additional mortality term that increases as nutrient concentrations decrease, following a Monod-type relationship.

The modified phytoplankton equation includes both base mortality (m_P) and nutrient-dependent mortality (m_P_N):

dP/dt = uptake - grazing - m_P * P - m_P_N * (K_N/(K_N + N)) * P

This formulation causes higher phytoplankton death rates when nutrients are scarce (N << K_N), helping to better capture the observed dynamics in the system.
