\section{Density-Dependent Nutrient Uptake Enhancement}

We incorporate positive density dependence in phytoplankton nutrient uptake to better represent collective population effects during bloom conditions. At intermediate population densities, phytoplankton can enhance local nutrient availability through mechanisms such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Increased extracellular enzyme activity breaking down organic matter
\item Local recycling of nutrients through cell lysis and bacterial decomposition
\item Reduced individual metabolic costs through collective boundary layer effects
\end{itemize}

This is modeled as a bell-shaped modifier to uptake efficiency that peaks at intermediate densities:

\[ f(P) = 1 + \frac{h_{max}}{1 + \left(\frac{P - P_{opt}}{\sigma_P}\right)^2} \]

where $h_{max}$ is the maximum enhancement factor, $P_{opt}$ is the optimal population density, and $\sigma_P$ controls the width of the density window where enhancement occurs. This better captures the nonlinear population dynamics observed during bloom formation and decline.
