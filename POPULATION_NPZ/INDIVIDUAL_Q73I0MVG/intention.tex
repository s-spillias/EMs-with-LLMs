\section{Variable Internal Nutrient Quota}

The model has been enhanced to include variable internal nutrient storage in phytoplankton cells, following Droop's cell quota model. This better represents how phytoplankton can buffer against nutrient fluctuations by storing excess nutrients when they are abundant and continuing to grow when external nutrients become scarce.

Key mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phytoplankton growth rate depends on internal rather than external nutrient concentration
    \item Nutrient uptake rate increases when internal stores are depleted
    \item Maximum storage capacity limits luxury uptake
    \item Minimum quota represents subsistence nutrient requirements
\end{itemize}

This mechanism helps explain the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms by accounting for the temporal decoupling between nutrient uptake and growth. It also provides a more realistic representation of how nutrient limitation affects phytoplankton population dynamics.
