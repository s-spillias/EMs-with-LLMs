\section{Model Enhancement: Light Limitation}

We enhanced the NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) model by incorporating seasonal light limitation effects on phytoplankton growth. This addition better represents the fundamental ecological process of photosynthesis, which depends not only on nutrient availability but also on light intensity.

The light limitation function follows an annual cycle:
\[ I_{rel}(t) = 0.5 + 0.4\cos\left(\frac{2\pi(t-180)}{365}\right) \]

where:
- $I_{rel}(t)$ represents relative light intensity (ranging from 0.1 to 0.9)
- $t$ is time in days
- Peak light occurs at day 180 (assuming Northern Hemisphere summer)

This modification creates a more mechanistically realistic representation of phytoplankton growth by:
1. Introducing seasonal forcing that affects primary production
2. Combining nutrient and light limitation through a multiplicative effect
3. Maintaining mathematical simplicity while capturing essential ecological processes

The new growth term becomes:
\[ \text{uptake} = r_{max} \cdot T_{scale} \cdot I_{rel} \cdot \frac{N}{K_N + N} \cdot P \]

This formulation follows Liebig's Law of the Minimum, where both light and nutrients can limit growth.
