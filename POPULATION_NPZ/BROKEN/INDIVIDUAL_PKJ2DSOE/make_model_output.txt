Based on the prediction plots, I notice that the model     
struggles to capture some of the longer-term dynamics,     
particularly in the nutrient (N) and zooplankton (Z)       
predictions. I propose adding light limitation to          
phytoplankton growth, as this is a crucial environmental   
factor that can create seasonal patterns in marine         
ecosystems.                                                

Let's add a seasonal light dependency that affects         
phytoplankton growth. Here are the changes:

 \section{Model Enhancement: Light Limitation}             
                                                           
 We enhanced the NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton)  
 model by incorporating seasonal light limitation effects  
 phytoplankton growth. This addition better represents the 
 fundamental ecological process of photosynthesis, which   
 depends not only on nutrient availability but also on lig 
 intensity.                                                
                                                           
 The light limitation function follows an annual cycle:    
 \[ I_{rel}(t) = 0.5 +                                     
 0.4\cos\left(\frac{2\pi(t-180)}{365}\right) \]            
                                                           
 where:                                                    
 - $I_{rel}(t)$ represents relative light intensity (rangi 
 from 0.1 to 0.9)                                          
 - $t$ is time in days                                     
 - Peak light occurs at day 180 (assuming Northern         
 Hemisphere summer)                                        
                                                           
 This modification creates a more mechanistically realisti 
 representation of phytoplankton growth by:                
 1. Introducing seasonal forcing that affects primary      
 production                                                
 2. Combining nutrient and light limitation through a      
 multiplicative effect                                     
 3. Maintaining mathematical simplicity while capturing    
 essential ecological processes                            
                                                           
 The new growth term becomes:                              
 \[ \text{uptake} = r_{max} \cdot T_{scale} \cdot I_{rel}  
 \cdot \frac{N}{K_N + N} \cdot P \]                        
                                                           
 This formulation follows Liebig's Law of the Minimum, whe 
 both light and nutrients can limit growth.

This enhancement adds seasonal forcing through light       
limitation, which is a key driver of marine ecosystem      
dynamics. The light function creates an annual cycle that  
modulates phytoplankton growth alongside temperature and   
nutrient limitation. The parameters are chosen to maintain 
reasonable bounds (light limitation between 0.1 and 0.9)   
while providing clear seasonal patterns.                   

The modification should help explain some of the           
longer-term oscillations visible in the data, particularly 
the periodic patterns in nutrient and phytoplankton        
concentrations that the current model struggles to capture.

This change:                                               

 1 Removes the direct copying of observed data into        
   predictions                                             
 2 Sets reasonable initial concentrations for all state    
   variables                                               
 3 Maintains positive values to prevent numerical issues   
 4 Lets the model dynamics determine the predictions rather
   than using observations                                 

The values 0.1 and 0.05 are typical starting concentrations
for marine ecosystems in similar units. The model will     
evolve these initial conditions based on its dynamics      
rather than using observed data directly.

This change:                                               

 1 Uses the first data point from each observation vector  
   to initialize the corresponding prediction vector       
 2 Maintains the connection between observations and       
   predictions at t=0                                      
 3 Lets the model dynamics determine subsequent predictions
   rather than using arbitrary values                      

The model will now start from the observed initial         
conditions and evolve according to the system dynamics,    
which is more appropriate than using arbitrary initial     
values.

This change:                                               

 1 Uses ADREPORT_VECTOR to properly declare prediction     
   vectors that TMB can track                              
 2 Explicitly resizes the vectors to match the time series 
   length                                                  
 3 Uses square bracket notation for consistency            
 4 Maintains initialization from data for t=0              

The ADREPORT_VECTOR declaration tells TMB these are        
prediction vectors we want to track and report, which      
should resolve the data leakage warning.

 1 Properly declares the prediction vectors as vector with 
   the correct size                                        
 2 Uses ADREPORT() instead of ADREPORT_VECTOR for proper   
   TMB integration                                         
 3 Maintains the same functionality but fixes the          
   declaration order issue                                 

The vectors are now properly declared before being used,   
which should resolve the data leakage warnings.

Let me fix the prediction vector issue by properly         
calculating them in the model. The key is to ensure we     
calculate predictions before using them in the likelihood  
calculations.

This change:                                               

 1 Properly declares the prediction vectors                
 2 Sets initial conditions from data                       
 3 Calculates predictions for all time points using a      
   simple Euler integration scheme                         
 4 Reports the predictions using ADREPORT                  
 5 Ensures predictions are calculated before being used in 
   likelihood calculations                                 

The model now has a complete prediction calculation that   
should resolve the data leakage warning.
