\section{Model Enhancement: Light Limitation}

This enhancement introduces light limitation effects on phytoplankton growth, which is a fundamental driver of primary production in marine ecosystems. The modification affects the nutrient uptake term in the phytoplankton equation.

The light limitation is implemented using a smooth sigmoid function:
\[ \text{light\_limitation} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \tanh(I_0 - k_I)) \]

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $I_0$ is the relative light intensity
\item $k_I$ is the half-saturation constant for light
\end{itemize}

The enhanced uptake equation becomes:
\[ \frac{dP}{dt} = \text{light\_limitation} \cdot \text{uptake} - \text{grazing} - \text{mort}_p \cdot P \]

This modification captures key ecological processes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Light-dependent photosynthesis
\item Seasonal variation in primary production
\item Resource co-limitation (nutrients and light)
\end{itemize}

The light limitation term provides a mechanistic basis for variation in phytoplankton growth efficiency and better represents the physiological constraints on primary production.
