This model incorporates size-dependent grazing efficiency to better represent zooplankton-phytoplankton interactions. As phytoplankton populations increase during blooms, community size structure typically shifts toward larger cells. This affects zooplankton grazing efficiency, with smaller cells generally being grazed more efficiently than larger ones.

The grazing efficiency term η(P) decreases with increasing phytoplankton biomass:
η(P) = η_max * K_η / (K_η + P)

where:
- η_max is the maximum grazing efficiency on small cells
- K_η is the half-saturation constant for size-dependent efficiency
- P is phytoplankton biomass

This mechanism helps explain why zooplankton cannot maintain the same grazing pressure during dense phytoplankton blooms, leading to higher peak abundances as observed in the data.
