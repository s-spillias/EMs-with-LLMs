This model incorporates temperature dependence of biological rates using the Arrhenius equation:

rate = rate_ref * exp(E_a/k_B * (1/T_ref - 1/T))

where:
- E_a is the activation energy (~0.6-0.7 eV for biological processes)
- k_B is the Boltzmann constant
- T_ref is the reference temperature (typically 293.15K)
- T is the ambient temperature

This modification reflects how metabolic rates and biochemical processes scale with temperature in marine ecosystems. The temperature dependence affects both nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and grazing by zooplankton, capturing seasonal variations in process efficiencies.
