This ecological model incorporates seasonal variation in biological rates using a bounded scaling factor:

rate = rate_base * (1 + 0.2 * tanh(E_a * T_amp * sin(2π*t/365)))

where:
- rate_base is the baseline rate
- E_a is a dimensionless temperature sensitivity scaling parameter
- T_amp controls the magnitude of seasonal variation
- t is time in days

The hyperbolic tangent function naturally bounds the scaling factor between 0.8 and 1.2 (±20% variation), ensuring biological realism and numerical stability. This simple relationship captures how metabolic processes like phytoplankton growth and zooplankton grazing vary seasonally, helping explain temporal variations in population dynamics that constant-rate models cannot capture.
