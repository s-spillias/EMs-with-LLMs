This model enhancement incorporates phytoplankton nutrient storage (luxury uptake), a well-documented ecological process where phytoplankton can uptake and store excess nutrients when they are abundant, using these reserves during nutrient-poor conditions. This mechanism helps explain how phytoplankton maintain growth during periods of nutrient limitation.

The model now tracks both structural biomass (P) and internal nutrient quota (Q) of phytoplankton. Growth rate depends on the internal quota rather than external nutrients, following Droop kinetics. This provides a more mechanistically accurate representation of nutrient-limited growth and helps explain the observed lag between nutrient depletion and phytoplankton decline.
