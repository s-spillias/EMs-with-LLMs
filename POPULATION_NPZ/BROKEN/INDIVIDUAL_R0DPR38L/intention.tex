This model incorporates light limitation effects on phytoplankton growth using:

uptake = vmax * (I/(I + KI)) * (N/(N + km)) * P

where I is the light intensity and KI is the half-saturation constant for light.

Light availability fundamentally controls photosynthesis and phytoplankton growth. Adding this mechanism allows the model to capture:
1. Daily and seasonal variations in primary production
2. Depth-dependent growth limitations
3. More realistic timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms

The light half-saturation parameter KI determines how strongly growth depends on light availability. This helps represent the photoacclimation capacity of phytoplankton communities.
