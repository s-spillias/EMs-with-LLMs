\section{Model Description}

This ecological model incorporates nutrient-dependent phytoplankton growth efficiency to better represent resource limitation effects. When nutrients are abundant, phytoplankton can achieve higher growth efficiency through luxury uptake and internal storage. Conversely, under nutrient stress, growth efficiency decreases as cells must expend more energy on nutrient acquisition.

This mechanism is implemented through a Monod-type function that modifies the base growth rate:

\[ \text{efficiency} = \text{eff\_base} + \text{eff\_max} \cdot \frac{N}{N + K\_\text{eff}} \]

where eff_base is the baseline efficiency, eff_max is the maximum additional efficiency possible under optimal nutrient conditions, and K_eff is the half-saturation constant for this relationship.

This addition better captures the observed dynamics, particularly the relationship between nutrient availability and phytoplankton growth patterns seen in the data.
