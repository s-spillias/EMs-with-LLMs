This model incorporates luxury nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, an important ecological mechanism where cells can store excess nutrients when they are abundant. This storage capacity acts as a buffer against nutrient limitation and better represents how phytoplankton respond to variable nutrient conditions in nature.

The key additions are:
- Q: Internal nutrient quota (nutrient:carbon ratio) of phytoplankton
- q_min: Minimum quota needed for growth
- q_max: Maximum storage capacity
- V_max: Maximum nutrient uptake rate

Growth rate now depends on the internal quota rather than external nutrients, following Droop kinetics: Î¼ = r_max * (1 - q_min/Q)
Nutrient uptake rate follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics but is also regulated by how full the storage capacity is.

This mechanism allows phytoplankton to:
1. "Luxury consume" nutrients when abundant
2. Continue growing when external nutrients become scarce
3. Show more realistic bloom dynamics due to storage effects
