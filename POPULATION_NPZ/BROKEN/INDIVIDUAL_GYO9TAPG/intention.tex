This ecological model focuses on the core interactions between nutrients, phytoplankton, and zooplankton in a marine ecosystem. The model captures:

1. Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton following Michaelis-Menten kinetics
2. Zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton using a Holling Type II functional response
3. Recycling of nutrients through mortality of both plankton groups

The model maintains parsimony while representing the key processes that drive plankton dynamics and nutrient cycling in marine systems.
