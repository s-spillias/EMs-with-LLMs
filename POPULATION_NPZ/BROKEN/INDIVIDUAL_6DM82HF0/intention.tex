\section{Model Description}

This ecological model incorporates light limitation into phytoplankton growth, recognizing that both nutrients and light are essential resources for photosynthesis. The light limitation follows a Monod-type response curve with seasonal variation, representing the changing day length and light intensity throughout the year.

The phytoplankton growth rate is now co-limited by both nutrients and light:

\[ \text{Growth} = r_{max} \cdot \text{temp\_scale} \cdot \frac{N}{K_N + N} \cdot \frac{I}{K_I + I} \cdot P \]

where I is the light intensity (varying seasonally) and K_I is the half-saturation constant for light limitation.

This modification better represents the mechanistic basis of phytoplankton growth, as both nutrients and light are essential resources that can limit primary production. The seasonal light variation helps explain temporal patterns in ecosystem dynamics.
