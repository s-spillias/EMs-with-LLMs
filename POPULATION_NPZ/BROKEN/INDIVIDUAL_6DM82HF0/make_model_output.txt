Based on the prediction comparison plots, I notice that the
model struggles to capture some key dynamics, particularly 
in the nutrient (N) cycling. I propose adding light        
limitation to phytoplankton growth, as this is a crucial   
environmental factor that often creates seasonal patterns  
in marine ecosystems.                                      

Let's make these changes:

 \section{Model Description}                               
                                                           
 This ecological model incorporates light limitation into  
 phytoplankton growth, recognizing that both nutrients and 
 light are essential resources for photosynthesis. The lig 
 limitation follows a Monod-type response curve with       
 seasonal variation, representing the changing day length  
 and light intensity throughout the year.                  
                                                           
 The phytoplankton growth rate is now co-limited by both   
 nutrients and light:                                      
                                                           
 \[ \text{Growth} = r_{max} \cdot \text{temp\_scale} \cdot 
 \frac{N}{K_N + N} \cdot \frac{I}{K_I + I} \cdot P \]      
                                                           
 where I is the light intensity (varying seasonally) and K 
 is the half-saturation constant for light limitation.     
                                                           
 This modification better represents the mechanistic basis 
 of phytoplankton growth, as both nutrients and light are  
 essential resources that can limit primary production. Th 
 seasonal light variation helps explain temporal patterns  
 ecosystem dynamics.

This modification adds light as a key environmental driver 
while keeping the model relatively simple. The seasonal    
light variation could help explain some of the oscillatory 
patterns seen in the prediction comparison plots,          
particularly the longer-term cycles in nutrient and        
phytoplankton concentrations.

This change:                                               

 1 Properly initializes the prediction vectors to zero     
 2 Sets initial conditions more directly without           
   unnecessary log transformations                         
 3 Maintains separation between observations and           
   predictions                                             

The model will now properly track predictions separately   
from observations, preventing data leakage while           
maintaining the same ecological dynamics.

   complete                                                
 4 Removes duplicate REPORT calls since ADREPORT handles   
   both reporting and automatic differentiation            

The model should now properly handle the predictions       
without data leakage warnings.

Let me fix the prediction issue by properly calculating and
storing predictions in the model. Here's the correction:

This change:                                               

 1 Initializes prediction vectors with the data            
 2 Calculates predictions using the model equations        
 3 Updates predictions using Euler integration             
 4 Ensures predictions stay positive                       
 5 Reports predictions using ADREPORT                      

The model should now properly calculate and track          
predictions without data leakage warnings.
