This model incorporates luxury nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, an important ecological mechanism where cells can store excess nutrients when they are abundant. This storage provides a buffer against nutrient limitation and better represents the adaptive strategies of phytoplankton.

The key additions are:
- Internal nutrient quota (Q) tracking for phytoplankton
- Uptake rate that depends on both external nutrients and current quota
- Growth rate dependent on internal quota rather than external nutrients
- Separate equations for nutrient uptake and growth

This mechanism helps explain:
- More realistic bloom dynamics as stored nutrients enable continued growth
- Better timing of population changes due to nutrient storage buffers
- More accurate representation of nutrient-limited growth
- Improved capture of luxury uptake during favorable conditions

The Droop equation relates growth to internal quota: μ = μmax * (1 - Qmin/Q)
Uptake follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics but is down-regulated as Q approaches Qmax.
