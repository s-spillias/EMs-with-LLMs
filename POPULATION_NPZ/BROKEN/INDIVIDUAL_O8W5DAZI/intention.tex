\section{Model Enhancement: Temperature-Dependent Growth}

We enhanced the NPZ model by incorporating temperature dependence in the phytoplankton growth rate using the Q10 relationship. This fundamental biological principle states that metabolic rates approximately double for every 10°C increase in temperature, though the exact factor (Q10) can vary between species and processes.

The modified growth rate equation is:

\[ \mu(T) = \mu_{max} \cdot [1 + (Q10-1)(T-T_{ref})/10] \]

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mu_{max}$ is the maximum growth rate at the reference temperature
\item $T$ is the ambient temperature
\item $T_{ref}$ is the reference temperature (15°C)
\item $Q10$ is the temperature sensitivity coefficient (typically ~2.0)
\end{itemize}

This modification better captures the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton growth, which is crucial in marine systems where temperature varies significantly throughout the year. The sharp peaks observed in the historical data suggest strong seasonal forcing, which this temperature-dependent growth mechanism helps to represent.

The Q10 relationship is well-established in marine ecology and has been extensively validated across different plankton groups. It provides a mechanistic basis for how temperature influences metabolic rates while maintaining model parsimony.
