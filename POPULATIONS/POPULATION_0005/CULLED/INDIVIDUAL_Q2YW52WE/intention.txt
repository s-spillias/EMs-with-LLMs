Model Assessment:
The current model fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics and underestimates coral mortality during outbreaks. The simple logistic growth model for COTS produces overly smooth population trajectories.

Improvement Strategy:
Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics by incorporating a critical density threshold. This creates positive density dependence at low populations (matching real reproductive dynamics where proximity aids success) while maintaining negative density dependence at high populations.

The Allee effect helps explain why COTS populations can remain low for extended periods before suddenly exploding into outbreaks when conditions are favorable. This better matches the observed boom-bust cycles in the data.
