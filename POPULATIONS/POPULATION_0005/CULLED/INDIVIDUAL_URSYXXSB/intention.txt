Model Assessment:
The current model underpredicts COTS outbreak magnitudes and lacks mechanisms for sudden population explosions. While it captures basic predator-prey dynamics, it misses critical threshold behaviors characteristic of COTS outbreaks.

Improvement: Adding Allee Effects
Implementing an Allee effect in COTS population dynamics to better represent:
1. Population thresholds that trigger outbreaks
2. Reproductive success that increases with density
3. More realistic boom-bust cycles

This addition provides mechanistic support for outbreak dynamics while maintaining model parsimony.
