You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) has a significant potential for exponential population growth:

1. Juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish exhibit exponential growth over their first year on the reef, reaching sizes up to 52.5 mm by mid-December (Uthicke et al., 2009).

2. The size ranges of juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish can increase by a factor of 3.5 from May to December, indicating rapid growth during this period (Uthicke et al., 2009).

3. Based on the periodicity (14-17 years) of past population cycles, it is expected that a new wave of crown-of-thorns starfish population irruptions will commence in the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in the near future (Pratchett et al., 2023).

4. Crown-of-thorns starfish that feed on coral exhibit accelerated growth compared to individuals that continue to feed on coralline algae, further contributing to their exponential population growth potential (Pratchett et al., 2020).

In summary, the available evidence suggests that crown-of-thorns starfish have a significant potential for exponential population growth, driven by their rapid juvenile growth, periodic population cycles, and the accelerated growth of coral-feeding individuals. This rapid growth and population expansion can have devastating impacts on coral reef ecosystems.

Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a direct numerical value for the log of COTS population growth rate (year^-1).

While the search results discuss exponential growth and rapid population dynamics of crown-of-thorns starfish, they do not provide a specific quantitative growth rate value that could be used to calculate the log of the population growth rate.

The results describe qualitative growth characteristics like:
- Juvenile size increases by a factor of 3.5 from May to December
- Periodic population cycles every 14-17 years
- Accelerated growth when feeding on coral

However, these descriptions do not translate directly into a numerical growth rate value.

Therefore, my response is:

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the optimal sea temperature for the survival of Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris) appears to be between 24°C and 29°C.

The first search result indicates that the sea surface temperatures at the collection locations for the Crown-of-thorns starfish generally range from 24°C to 29°C annually (AIMS 2021a). This suggests that this temperature range is suitable for the survival of this species.

The second search result further supports this, stating that 32°C is above the thermal optimum for Crown-of-thorns starfish, and prolonged exposure to temperatures at this level can negatively impact their performance and survival (Uthicke et al. 2022).

Additionally, the third search result suggests that the optimal breeding season for Crown-of-thorns starfish in New Caledonia is concentrated around the end of the calendar year, when water temperatures reach above 26°C (Pratchett et al. 2021). This indicates that temperatures around 26°C or higher are favorable for the reproductive success of this species.

In summary, the optimal sea temperature for the survival of Crown-of-thorns starfish appears to be between 24°C and 29°C, with temperatures above 32°C being detrimental to their performance and survival. The species also seems to thrive in water temperatures above 26°C, which is optimal for their reproductive outputs.

Based on the search results, I'll extract the temperature values for COTS survival:

Temperatures mentioned:
- Minimum: 24°C
- Maximum: 29°C
- Optimal around 26°C

Since the question asks for the log of optimal temperature, I'll convert 26°C to its logarithmic value:

log(26) ≈ 1.41

Therefore, the JSON response would be:

{"min": 1.38, "max": 1.46, "value": 1.41}

Notes on calculation:
- Converted temperatures to log values
- log(24) ≈ 1.38
- log(29) ≈ 1.46
- log(26) ≈ 1.41 (average/optimal)
- Used natural logarithm (base e)

The values represent the log of temperature in °C, matching the model's expected units.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the thermal tolerance range for the Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) population appears to be between 18°C and 31°C, with the optimal range being 26°C to 30°C.

The first study (Johnson and Babcock, 1994) reported a thermal tolerance range of 18-31°C for the gastrula and bipinnaria stages of the Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) (1).

The second study found that the thermal tolerance range for the Crown-of-thorns starfish is 18-31°C (2).

The third study exposed Crown-of-thorns starfish to four different thermal treatments, with final temperatures of 26°C (control, annual average), 28°C (summer average), and 30°C (summer maximum). The results showed that the starfish performed and survived best at the 26°C control temperature, with reduced performance and survival at the higher temperatures (3).

In summary, the available research indicates that the thermal tolerance range for the Crown-of-thorns starfish population is approximately 18-31°C, with an optimal range of 26-30°C. Temperatures above 30°C can negatively impact the performance and survival of these starfish.

I'll help you extract the numerical values for the log of temperature tolerance range.

First, I'll calculate the log of the temperature values:
- Minimum temperature: log(18) = 1.26
- Maximum temperature: log(31) = 1.49
- Average temperature: log((18+31)/2) = log(24.5) = 1.39

Therefore, the JSON response would be:

{"min": 1.26, "max": 1.49, "value": 1.39}

This response represents the log-transformed temperature tolerance range for the Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), based on the provided search results. The values are in log(°C), as requested, and capture the full range of thermal tolerance from 18°C to 31°C, with an average around 24.5°C.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the predation impact of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) on fast-growing coral species can be summarized as follows:

Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) are known to preferentially feed on fast-growing coral species, such as branching corals and plate corals of the genus Acropora (AIMS). This selective predation can act to increase coral species richness by reducing the dominance of these fast-growing species (Pratchett et al., 2014).

During COTS outbreaks, their feeding behavior can have significant impacts on reef systems. They can reduce live coral cover, erode reef complexity, and cause shifts in reef trophic structure (Pratchett et al., 2014). For areas where COTS focus their predation on Acropora corals, which are among the fastest-growing coral species with the greatest recovery potential, the impacts can be particularly severe (Pratchett et al., 2014).

In summary, the predation impact of crown-of-thorns starfish on fast-growing coral species, such as Acropora, can lead to a reduction in the dominance of these species, potentially increasing coral species richness, but also causing significant damage to reef ecosystems during COTS outbreaks.

No relevant values found. 

The search results discuss crown-of-thorns starfish predation on corals but do not provide a specific numerical value for the log of grazing rate on fast-growing corals in m2/individual/year. While the text describes predation impacts, it does not include the precise quantitative measurement requested.

To obtain this specific numerical value, additional research or more detailed scientific sources would be needed that directly measure the grazing rate of crown-of-thorns starfish on coral surfaces.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, predation by starfish can have a significant impact on slow-growing coral species in coral reef communities. 

The first study suggests that predation of coral polyps by aggregations of adult starfish may be a natural cyclic phenomenon, similar to predation of plants in terrestrial ecosystems (Moran, 1986). This indicates that starfish predation can be a natural part of the coral reef ecosystem dynamics.

The second study found that along a gradient of increasing fishing intensity, predator densities declined while starfish densities increased by three orders of magnitude. This led to cascading effects, where the loss of predators allowed starfish populations to explode and cause significant damage to the coral reef community (Dulvy et al., 2004).

The third study provides more details on the life cycle of crown-of-thorns starfish, a major coral predator. It notes that juvenile starfish are initially slow-growing and feed on crustose coralline algae, before switching to feeding on hard corals as they mature (Birkeland & Lucas, 1990). This slow initial growth phase allows the starfish populations to build up before they start rapidly consuming the slower-growing coral species.

In summary, the search results indicate that predation by starfish, particularly crown-of-thorns starfish, can have a significant negative impact on slow-growing coral species in coral reef ecosystems. This impact can be exacerbated by the loss of predators that would normally keep starfish populations in check. Effective management strategies are needed to monitor and control starfish outbreaks to protect vulnerable coral communities.

No relevant values found. 

While the search results discuss starfish predation on corals in detail, they do not provide any specific numerical values for grazing rate on slow-growing corals in m2/individual/year. The text describes predation dynamics and population interactions, but does not quantify the specific grazing rate metric requested.

To obtain this value, additional research or more specific scientific literature would need to be consulted that directly measures coral grazing rates by starfish.

Based on the search results, there is evidence that coral species can recover and regenerate rapidly, especially when aided by artificial structures.

The first study, published in Nature Scientific Reports, found that the creation of artificial structures can facilitate rapid coral community recovery and increase resilience against climate change impacts like coral bleaching (Abelson et al., 2023). The researchers observed that coral cover increased significantly on artificial structures compared to natural reefs.

Similarly, a study published in Current Biology reported that coral restoration efforts can drive rapid recovery of coral reef carbonate budgets (Roff et al., 2023). Within 4 years, the researchers found that fast coral growth supported a rapid recovery of coral cover, from 17% to 56%, as well as increased substrate rugosity.

Finally, a news article summarizing a study in Japan found that corals recover faster on artificial structures compared to natural reefs after bleaching events (Mongabay, 2023). The researchers attributed this to the ability of artificial structures to provide suitable substrate and habitat for coral settlement and growth.

In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that coral species have significant potential for rapid recovery and regeneration, especially when aided by the creation of artificial structures or coral restoration efforts. These findings highlight the importance of proactive conservation and restoration measures to support the resilience of coral reef ecosystems in the face of climate change and other threats.

After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the log of fast coral growth rate (year^-1). While the results discuss coral recovery and growth rates qualitatively, they do not provide a precise logarithmic growth rate value.

The text mentions percentage increases in coral cover (from 17% to 56% in 4 years) and discusses rapid recovery, but does not translate this into a log growth rate.

Therefore, my response is:

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the key points regarding the slow recovery and regeneration potential of coral species are:

1. Coral species, especially long-lived and slow-growing deep-sea coral species, are expected to recover slowly after disturbances. A study on deep-sea coral species found that they have a limited ability to recover after disturbances due to their slow growth rates (Projecting the recovery of a long‐lived deep‐sea coral species after disturbance, Baco-Taylor et al. 2019).

2. The recovery potential of coral populations is influenced by the level of degradation on the reef. Degraded reefs have reduced replenishment of adult coral populations due to limited habitat availability for coral recruitment (Coral reef degradation affects the potential for reef recovery after disturbance, Riegl & Purkis 2015).

3. Increased structural complexity on reefs has been shown to have great potential for the recovery of coral species abundance and richness after disturbances. This suggests that restoring habitat complexity can facilitate the recovery of coral populations (Recovery potential of fish and coral populations following ecological disturbance, Komyakova et al. 2018).

In summary, the slow growth and recovery rates of coral species, especially long-lived deep-sea corals, combined with the negative impacts of reef degradation on coral recruitment, indicate that the regeneration potential of coral populations is limited. Restoring habitat complexity may help facilitate the recovery of coral communities after disturbances.
