This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interactions with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS larval survival and recruitment
2. Density-dependent COTS population growth
3. Differential predation on fast-growing (Acropora) vs slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) corals
4. Coral growth and recovery dynamics
5. Environmental thresholds that trigger outbreak events

Key mechanisms:
- COTS outbreaks are triggered by enhanced larval survival at optimal temperatures
- Population growth is limited by coral availability (resource limitation)
- Coral recovery is modeled with logistic growth, modified by COTS predation
- System includes feedback loops where coral depletion eventually limits COTS population growth

The model uses time series data of COTS abundance, coral cover (fast/slow-growing), sea surface temperature, and larval immigration rates to predict outbreak dynamics.
