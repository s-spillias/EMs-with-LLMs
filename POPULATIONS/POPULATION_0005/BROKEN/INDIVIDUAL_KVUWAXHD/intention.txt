Model Assessment:
The current model underestimates COTS outbreak intensity and fails to capture the sharp population explosions seen in historical data. The smooth predictions suggest missing positive feedback mechanisms during outbreak events.

Improvement: Density-dependent Predation Efficiency
Added density-dependent modification to COTS grazing rates to represent:
1. Increased feeding efficiency at higher densities due to reduced search time
2. Aggregation effects during spawning periods
3. Overwhelmed coral defense mechanisms

This creates a positive feedback loop where initial COTS increases lead to more efficient predation, supporting rapid population growth during outbreaks while maintaining stability at low densities.
