Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Model Assessment:
- Basic predator-prey dynamics captured but outbreak intensities understated
- Temperature-dependent recruitment included but other environmental effects limited
- Simple linear predation terms may oversimplify outbreak dynamics

Key Missing Process:
Density-dependent predation efficiency during outbreaks. Research shows COTS feeding rates
per individual often decrease at high densities due to:
- Interference competition between COTS
- Local depletion of preferred coral
- Changed behavior at high densities

Improvement Implementation:
Added density-dependent modifier to attack rate that decreases predation efficiency
as COTS density increases. This better reflects field observations of reduced
per-capita feeding during outbreaks while maintaining simpler dynamics at low densities.
