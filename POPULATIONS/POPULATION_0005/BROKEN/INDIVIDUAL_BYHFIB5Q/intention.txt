Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but shows delayed responses to outbreaks and misses some key fluctuations in coral cover. While it includes temperature effects on recruitment and selective predation, the timing and magnitude of outbreaks need improvement.

Proposed Improvement: Density-dependent predation efficiency
- Adding interference competition between COTS during feeding
- Represents reduced feeding efficiency at high COTS densities
- Helps capture more realistic outbreak dynamics
- Supported by field observations of COTS behavior

This modification should improve the model's ability to:
1. Better represent the self-limiting nature of COTS outbreaks
2. Capture more realistic coral recovery patterns
3. Produce more accurate timing of population crashes after outbreaks
