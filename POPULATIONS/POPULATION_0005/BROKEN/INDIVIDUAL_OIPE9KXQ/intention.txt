Model Assessment:
- Current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but misses outbreak timing
- Predictions smooth out observed population fluctuations
- Outbreak crashes and coral recovery delays not well represented

Improvement Strategy:
Added density-dependent COTS mortality and coral recovery inhibition during outbreaks to better represent:
1. Rapid COTS population crashes after reaching high densities
2. Reduced coral recovery rates during/after COTS outbreaks
3. More realistic boom-bust cycle dynamics

These mechanisms are supported by field observations showing mass COTS die-offs after food depletion and prolonged coral recovery periods following major outbreaks.
