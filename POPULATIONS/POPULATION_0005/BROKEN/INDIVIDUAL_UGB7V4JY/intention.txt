Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current model limitations:
- Fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics
- Underestimates population variability
- Misses key transition points

Improvement: Adding Allee effect to COTS population dynamics
Rationale:
1. COTS show positive density dependence during outbreak initiation due to:
   - Enhanced fertilization success at higher densities
   - Group feeding benefits
   - Predator saturation
2. This creates bistability that better matches observed outbreak patterns
3. Helps explain why some disturbances trigger outbreaks while others don't

Mathematical implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter
- Modified COTS growth equation to include positive density dependence
- Maintained negative density dependence at high populations
