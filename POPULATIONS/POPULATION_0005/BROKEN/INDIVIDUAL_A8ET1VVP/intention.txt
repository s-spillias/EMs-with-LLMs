Model Assessment:
Current implementation shows poor fit to observed COTS outbreaks and coral dynamics. The model particularly struggles with:
1. Timing and magnitude of COTS population explosions
2. Variability in coral cover
3. Non-linear recovery patterns

Improvement Implementation:
Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics to better capture outbreak behavior. This creates:
- Positive density dependence at low populations (mate-finding)
- Negative density dependence at high populations (resource competition)
- Critical population threshold for outbreaks

This mechanism better represents the biological reality of COTS reproduction requiring sufficient local population density for successful fertilization, while maintaining carrying capacity constraints.
