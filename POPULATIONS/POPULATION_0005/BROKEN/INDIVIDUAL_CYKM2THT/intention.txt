Model Assessment and Improvements:

1. Current Performance:
- Model underpredicts COTS outbreak peaks
- Smooths out observed population fluctuations
- Misses timing of some key transitions

2. Added Allee Effect Mechanism:
- Incorporates positive density dependence at low COTS densities
- Represents benefits of synchronized spawning and aggregation
- Maintains negative density dependence at high populations
- Better captures outbreak triggers and population explosions

3. Mathematical Implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter
- Modified COTS growth equation to include Allee term
- Maintains biological realism while improving outbreak dynamics
