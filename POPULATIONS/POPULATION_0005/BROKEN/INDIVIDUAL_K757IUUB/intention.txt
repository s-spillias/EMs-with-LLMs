Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and misses key population triggers. Adding an Allee effect through a critical density threshold improves representation of:

1. Enhanced reproductive success when population density exceeds critical levels
2. Synchronized spawning benefits in denser populations
3. Predator saturation effects at higher densities

This mechanism helps explain why COTS populations can remain low for extended periods before rapidly transitioning to outbreak states, better matching observed dynamics.
