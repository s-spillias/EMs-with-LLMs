Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current model evaluation:
- Captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak intensities
- Missing important density-dependent reproduction effects
- Simplified predation impacts may not reflect real ecological processes

Improvement: Adding Allee effect to COTS population dynamics
Rationale:
1. COTS show positive density dependence in reproduction due to:
   - Synchronized spawning benefits
   - Increased fertilization success at higher densities
   - Group formation improving feeding efficiency
2. This mechanism helps explain rapid outbreak development
3. Better matches ecological understanding of COTS population dynamics

Mathematical implementation:
- Modified growth term incorporating Allee threshold
- Maintains carrying capacity constraints
- Allows stronger positive feedback during outbreak initiation
