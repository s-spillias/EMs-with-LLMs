Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current model limitations:
- Fails to capture explosive nature of COTS outbreaks
- Underestimates population peaks and variability
- Misses key ecological threshold effects

Improvement: Adding Allee effect to COTS population dynamics
Rationale:
1. COTS show positive density dependence during outbreak initiation due to:
   - Enhanced fertilization success at higher densities
   - Synchronized spawning benefits
   - Group feeding advantages
2. This mechanism helps explain rapid outbreak development
3. Better captures threshold-dependent population dynamics

Mathematical implementation:
- Modified logistic growth with Allee term
- New parameter for Allee threshold density
- Maintains basic structure while adding key ecological process
