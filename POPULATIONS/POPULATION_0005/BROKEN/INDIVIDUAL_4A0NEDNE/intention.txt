Model Assessment:
Current implementation captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and misses sharp population transitions. Temperature effects are oversimplified.

Improvement Strategy:
Added Allee effects to COTS population dynamics to better represent:
1. Positive density dependence during outbreak initiation (synchronized spawning benefits)
2. Negative density dependence at high densities (resource competition)
3. More realistic outbreak thresholds

This modification should improve capture of characteristic boom-bust cycles while maintaining model parsimony.
