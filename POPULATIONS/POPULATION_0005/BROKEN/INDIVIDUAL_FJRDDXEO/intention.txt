Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current model limitations:
1. Underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes
2. Misses characteristic boom-bust dynamics
3. Lacks explicit outbreak triggering mechanisms

Improvement: Adding Allee effects and density-dependent mortality
- Allee effects capture reduced reproduction at low densities
- Density-dependent mortality increases during outbreaks
- These mechanisms better represent outbreak triggers and crashes

Mathematical changes:
1. Modified COTS growth equation to include:
   - Allee effect term (beta_allee * cots_pred)
   - Additional density-dependent mortality (gamma_dd * cots_pred^2)
2. These terms create more realistic population dynamics:
   - Slower growth at low densities
   - Faster crashes at high densities
   - More pronounced boom-bust cycles
