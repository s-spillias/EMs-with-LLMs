Model Assessment:
The current model fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics and underestimates coral mortality during outbreaks. The smooth COTS predictions suggest missing mechanisms for population explosions.

Improvement Strategy:
Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics to better represent:
1. Difficulty establishing populations at low densities
2. Rapid population growth once critical density is reached
3. More realistic boom-bust cycles

This creates a bistable system that can better capture sudden transitions to outbreak states.
