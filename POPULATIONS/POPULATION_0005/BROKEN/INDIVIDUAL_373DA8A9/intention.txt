Model Assessment:
Current model captures basic dynamics but underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes and coral mortality impacts.

Improvement: Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics
Rationale: COTS show positive density-dependence in reproduction due to broadcast spawning - fertilization success increases with adult density. This mechanism helps explain sudden outbreak occurrences and their self-reinforcing nature once triggered.

Mathematical implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter (A_cots)
- Modified COTS growth equation to include multiplicative Allee term: (N/A_cots)/(1 + N/A_cots)
- This creates weak Allee effect where growth is reduced but still positive at low densities
