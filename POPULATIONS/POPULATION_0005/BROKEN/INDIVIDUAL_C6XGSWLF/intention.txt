Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak intensities and subsequent population crashes. While temperature-dependent recruitment and coral type preferences are included, the model lacks key density-dependent processes that characterize COTS outbreaks.

Proposed Improvement: Addition of density-dependent mortality
Ecological justification:
1. COTS populations show increased mortality at high densities due to:
   - Disease transmission intensifying with population density
   - Resource depletion leading to starvation
   - Reproductive interference at high densities
2. This mechanism helps explain rapid population crashes post-outbreak
3. Provides negative feedback missing from current model

Mathematical implementation:
- Added quadratic mortality term to COTS dynamics
- Mortality increases non-linearly with density
- Effect becomes significant only during outbreaks
