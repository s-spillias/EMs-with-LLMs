Model Assessment:
The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and lacks key density-dependent behaviors.

Improvement: Added density-dependent predation efficiency
Ecological Justification:
- COTS show increased feeding efficiency at higher densities due to group feeding behavior
- This positive feedback helps explain rapid coral loss during outbreaks
- Supported by field observations of accelerated coral mortality during outbreak events
