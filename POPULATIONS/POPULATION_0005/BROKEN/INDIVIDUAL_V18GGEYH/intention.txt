Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current model limitations:
- Fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics
- Underestimates population variability
- Missing key ecological triggers

Improvement: Adding Allee effect to COTS population dynamics
Rationale:
1. COTS show positive density dependence during outbreak initiation due to:
   - Enhanced fertilization success at higher densities
   - Predator saturation effects
   - Group feeding benefits
2. This mechanism helps explain the rapid transition to outbreak states
3. Provides ecological basis for boom-bust dynamics
