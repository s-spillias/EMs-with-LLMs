Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and misses key population explosion triggers. Comparison plots show the model particularly struggles with the 1990-1991 outbreak peak.

Added Allee Effect Mechanism:
Incorporating an Allee effect in COTS population dynamics to represent:
1. Enhanced reproductive success at medium densities (synchronized spawning)
2. Reduced success at low densities (mate-finding limitation)
3. Resource limitation at high densities (original carrying capacity)

This better reflects COTS reproductive biology where population growth rate increases with density up to a threshold before declining, helping trigger and sustain outbreak events.
