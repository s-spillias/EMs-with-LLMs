Model Assessment:
Current implementation shows reasonable baseline behavior but underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes and coral response dynamics. The model captures basic predator-prey interactions but lacks mechanisms for explosive population growth.

Improvement Implementation:
Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics to better represent outbreak characteristics. This creates a critical population threshold that must be exceeded before rapid population growth occurs, matching observed outbreak patterns. The Allee effect is implemented through a modified logistic growth equation that includes a threshold term.

Ecological Justification:
COTS show strong Allee effects in nature due to:
1. Broadcast spawning requiring minimum density for successful fertilization
2. Group feeding behavior increasing predation efficiency
3. Predator saturation effects at higher densities

This addition should improve capture of outbreak timing and magnitude while maintaining model parsimony.
