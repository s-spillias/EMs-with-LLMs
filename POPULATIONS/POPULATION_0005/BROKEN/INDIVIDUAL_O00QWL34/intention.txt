Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current model evaluation:
- Captures basic dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes
- Missing important nonlinear population processes
- Temperature effects may be oversimplified

Improvement: Implementation of Allee effect in COTS population dynamics
Justification:
1. COTS require minimum population density for successful reproduction
2. Will better capture rapid outbreak dynamics
3. Provides natural control at low densities
4. Supported by literature on COTS reproductive biology

Mathematical implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter
- Modified COTS growth equation to include positive density dependence at low numbers
- Maintains carrying capacity control at high densities
