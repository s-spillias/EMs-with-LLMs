Model Assessment:
Current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak intensities and misses some key ecological feedbacks.

Improvement: Added density-dependent recruitment success for COTS
Rationale: COTS larvae experience higher survival rates at higher adult densities due to:
1. Predator saturation effects
2. Enhanced fertilization success
3. Reduced per-capita predation risk

This positive feedback mechanism helps explain rapid outbreak development and better matches observed population spikes.
