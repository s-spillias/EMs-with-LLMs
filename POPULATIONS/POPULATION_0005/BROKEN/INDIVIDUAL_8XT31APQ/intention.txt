Model Assessment:
Current model captures basic coral-COTS dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and misses some key ecological processes.

Improvement Strategy:
Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics to better represent density-dependent reproductive success. This modification helps capture the characteristic rapid population explosions when COTS density exceeds critical thresholds for successful fertilization during spawning events.
