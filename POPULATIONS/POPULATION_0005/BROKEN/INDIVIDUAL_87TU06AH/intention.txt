Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Model Limitations:
- Underestimates magnitude of COTS outbreaks
- Misses sharp coral decline during peak outbreaks
- Uses constant predation rates regardless of COTS density

Improvement: Density-dependent predation rates
Ecological Justification:
- COTS show increased feeding efficiency at higher densities
- Aggregation behavior during outbreaks accelerates coral mortality
- Creates positive feedback loop driving outbreak dynamics

Mathematical Implementation:
- Added density-dependent multiplier to grazing rates
- Base rate applies at low densities
- Efficiency increases with population size but saturates
- Separate parameters for onset and saturation of group feeding
