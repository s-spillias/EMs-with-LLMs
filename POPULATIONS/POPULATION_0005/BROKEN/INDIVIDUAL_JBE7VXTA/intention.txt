Model Assessment:
Current model underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes and fails to capture characteristic boom-bust dynamics. Coral predictions show oversimplified responses.

Improvement: Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics
Rationale: COTS reproduction success depends strongly on population density due to broadcast spawning. Below critical densities, fertilization rates drop dramatically. This mechanism helps explain sudden population explosions when density thresholds are exceeded.

Mathematical implementation:
- Added fixed Allee threshold constant (0.2 individuals/m2)
- Modified COTS growth equation with quadratic Allee effect term
- Uses smooth transition between low and high density regimes
- Maintains negative density dependence at high populations
