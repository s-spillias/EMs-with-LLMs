Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current model evaluation:
- Captures basic population dynamics but smooths out sharp outbreak peaks
- Includes key processes like temperature effects and coral preferences
- Reasonable fit to general trends but misses outbreak intensity

Key missing process:
The model lacks mechanisms that can trigger rapid population explosions characteristic of COTS outbreaks. In particular, it misses the Allee effect where reproductive success increases with density due to more efficient fertilization at higher population densities.

Improvement implementation:
Adding an Allee effect term to the COTS population dynamics to better capture:
1. Difficulty in population growth at very low densities
2. Increased reproductive success at medium densities
3. Upper limit on reproductive benefits at high densities

This addition should help generate more realistic outbreak patterns while maintaining model parsimony.
