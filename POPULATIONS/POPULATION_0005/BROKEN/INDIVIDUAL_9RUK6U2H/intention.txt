Model Assessment:
- Current model underpredicts COTS outbreak magnitudes
- Misses sharp transitions in population dynamics
- Simplified linear density dependence doesn't capture complex outbreak triggers

Improvement: Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics
Rationale:
- COTS show strong positive density dependence at low-medium densities due to:
  * Synchronized spawning benefits
  * Enhanced fertilization success at higher densities
  * Predator saturation effects
- This mechanism helps explain rapid outbreak development
- Better captures transition between stable and outbreak states
