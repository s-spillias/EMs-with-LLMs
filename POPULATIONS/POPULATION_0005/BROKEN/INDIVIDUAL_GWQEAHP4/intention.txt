Model Assessment:
The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and misses key threshold behaviors. Historical data shows more explosive population growth during outbreaks than the model predicts.

Improvement Strategy:
Adding Allee effects to COTS population dynamics to better represent:
1. Density-dependent reproductive success
2. Group feeding advantages
3. Predator saturation effects

This modification should improve the model's ability to capture outbreak triggers and magnitudes while maintaining mechanistic simplicity.
