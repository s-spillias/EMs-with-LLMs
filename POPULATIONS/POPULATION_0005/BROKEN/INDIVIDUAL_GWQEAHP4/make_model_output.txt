Proposed Improvement: I'll add Allee effects to better capture outbreak dynamics. This means COTS populations need to reach a critical density before explosive growth occurs, which is ecologically justified by:

 The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and misses key threshold behaviors. Historical data shows more explosive population growth during outbreaks than the model predicts.

This modification introduces a critical density threshold while maintaining model parsimony. The Allee effect term (allee_effect) scales population growth smoothly from near-zero at low densities to maximum potential at high densities, better capturing the explosive nature of COTS outbreaks.

The error occurs because we need to declare the log_allee parameter. Let me fix that by adding it to the parameters section:

This adds the missing parameter declaration that was causing the compilation error. The parameter was already defined in parameters.json but needed to be declared in the model code.

The error suggests numerical instability in the gradient evaluation. Let's modify the Allee effect implementation to ensure better numerical stability and prevent NA/NaN values. We'll also adjust the initial parameter value:

 1 Replace the simple ratio-based Allee effect with a smoother sigmoid function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 2 Use a larger minimum denominator (0.1) to prevent extreme values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 3 Add explicit bounds on relative density                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 4 Improve growth rate bounds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 5 Use explicit Type(1.0) for better numerical precision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

The modified Allee effect implementation provides a smoother transition and better numerical stability while maintaining the same ecological meaning.

Let's simplify the Allee effect implementation to improve numerical stability. I'll modify the model.cpp file:

The simpler formulation should provide better numerical stability while maintaining the key ecological mechanisms.

Let's modify the model to improve numerical stability by adjusting the Allee effect implementation and growth calculations:
