Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak intensities and misses key population acceleration mechanisms. The addition of an Allee effect will better represent the biological reality of COTS reproduction and outbreak formation.

Ecological Justification:
1. COTS show enhanced fertilization success at higher densities due to synchronized spawning
2. Group formation provides protection from predators
3. These positive density-dependent effects help explain rapid outbreak development

Mathematical Implementation:
- Added Allee effect term to COTS growth equation
- New parameter for Allee threshold density
- Maintains negative density dependence at high densities
