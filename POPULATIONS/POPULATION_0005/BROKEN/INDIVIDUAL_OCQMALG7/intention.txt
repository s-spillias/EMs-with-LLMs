Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Model Limitations:
- Underpredicts COTS outbreak magnitudes
- Fails to capture sharp transitions in population dynamics
- Lacks mechanisms for true outbreak behavior

Improvement: Adding Allee Effect
- Implements positive density dependence at low-medium COTS densities
- Represents enhanced reproductive success during population growth
- Maintains carrying capacity limits at high densities
- Better captures the biological mechanism of synchronized spawning
