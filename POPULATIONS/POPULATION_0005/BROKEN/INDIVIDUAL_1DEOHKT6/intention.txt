Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak intensities and misses key population mechanisms. Comparison plots show the model smoothing out observed COTS population spikes, particularly around 1990.

Key Improvement: Added Allee effect in COTS population dynamics
Justification:
1. COTS reproduction requires proximity for successful fertilization
2. Higher adult densities create positive feedback in recruitment success
3. Helps explain sudden population explosions once critical density reached
4. Better matches observed outbreak patterns in historical data

Mathematical Implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter (A) below which population growth is suppressed
- Modified COTS growth equation to include (N-A) term
- Maintains carrying capacity (K) upper bound while adding lower critical threshold
