Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Model Limitations:
- Fails to capture sharp COTS outbreak events
- Underestimates population variability
- Missing key mechanisms for population explosions

Improvement: Adding Allee Effect
- Implements positive density dependence at low COTS densities
- Maintains negative density dependence at high densities
- Better represents mate-finding dynamics
- Helps explain sudden population explosions
- Provides mechanism for outbreak triggers

Mathematical Implementation:
- Modified logistic growth with Allee threshold
- New parameter for critical density threshold
- Maintains biological realism while adding necessary complexity
