Model Assessment:
Current implementation captures basic predator-prey dynamics but underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes and misses key population explosion triggers.

Improvement Strategy:
Adding Allee effects to COTS population dynamics to better represent:
1. Enhanced reproductive success at higher densities
2. Critical population thresholds for outbreak initiation
3. More realistic boom-bust cycle magnitudes

This modification should improve capture of outbreak timing and intensity while maintaining model parsimony.
