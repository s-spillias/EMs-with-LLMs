Model Assessment:
Current model captures basic dynamics but underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes and coral mortality impacts. Temperature effects and predation preferences are included but their influence appears dampened.

Improvement Implementation:
Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics to better represent density-dependent reproduction success. This modification is justified by COTS' broadcast spawning strategy, where fertilization success increases non-linearly with population density. The Allee threshold represents the critical density below which reproduction becomes inefficient.

The modified growth equation includes:
- Basic logistic growth (as before)
- Allee effect term that reduces growth at low densities
- Temperature modulation (maintained from original)

This should improve capture of:
1. Difficulty in establishing outbreaks at very low densities
2. Rapid population growth once critical density is exceeded
3. More realistic outbreak magnitudes
