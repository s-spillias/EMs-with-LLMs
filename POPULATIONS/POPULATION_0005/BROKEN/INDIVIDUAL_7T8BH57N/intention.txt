Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and misses some key ecological processes. The comparison plots show the model particularly struggles to reproduce the sharp population increases during outbreaks.

Key Improvement: Adding Allee Effects
- Biological basis: COTS show enhanced reproductive success at medium densities due to increased fertilization rates and group feeding behaviors
- Mathematical implementation: Modified growth term incorporating positive density dependence at low-medium densities
- Expected impact: Better reproduction of outbreak dynamics while maintaining biological realism
