This model captures the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interactions with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model emphasizes:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
- Temperature-dependent larval survival and recruitment
- Density-dependent mortality
- Resource-dependent growth and reproduction
- Immigration of larvae from external sources

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
- Different growth rates for fast (Acropora) vs slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) corals
- Selective predation by COTS with preference for fast-growing species
- Temperature-dependent coral growth and mortality
- Coral recovery through recruitment and growth

3. Environmental Drivers:
- Sea surface temperature effects on both COTS and coral dynamics
- External larval supply as outbreak trigger
- Resource limitation through coral availability

4. Key Mechanisms:
- Delayed density dependence in COTS population growth
- Threshold effects in larval survival and recruitment
- Feedback loops between coral abundance and COTS survival
- Non-linear functional responses in COTS predation rates

The model aims to reproduce the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations while maintaining biological realism in all processes.
