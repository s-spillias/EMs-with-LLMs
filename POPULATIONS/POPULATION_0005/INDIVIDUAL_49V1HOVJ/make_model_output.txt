You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

I'll help create a comprehensive TMB model for the Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) system. Let's start with the intention.txt to outline the ecological framework, then build the model and parameters.

Attempt 3 for log_r_cots: Crown of Thorns starfish population exponential growth potential
Search results found for log_r_cots
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) has the potential for exponential population growth under certain conditions:

1. Juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish exhibit rapid, exponential growth in their first year on the reef. One study found that juvenile starfish increased in size by a factor of 3.5 from May to December, reaching up to 52.5 mm in size by mid-December (Uthicke et al., 2009).

2. The periodicity of past population outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish is around 14-17 years (Pratchett et al., 2023). Based on this, it is expected that a new wave of population irruptions will commence in the northern Great Barrier Reef in the near future.

3. Coral-feeding crown-of-thorns starfish, in particular, exhibit accelerated growth compared to individuals that continue to feed on coralline algae (Wilmes et al., 2020). This suggests that a shift to coral-feeding can facilitate rapid population growth.

In summary, the combination of exponential growth in juveniles, periodic population outbreaks, and the potential for accelerated growth in coral-feeding individuals indicates that crown-of-thorns starfish have a high capacity for exponential population growth under favorable conditions. Continued monitoring and management of these starfish populations is crucial to mitigate their impacts on coral reef ecosystems.

Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a direct numerical value for the log of COTS intrinsic growth rate (year^-1). 

While the search results discuss exponential growth and population dynamics of crown-of-thorns starfish, they do not provide a specific quantitative growth rate value that could be used to calculate the log growth rate.

The results describe qualitative growth characteristics like:
- Juveniles increasing in size by a factor of 3.5 in 7 months
- Periodic population outbreaks every 14-17 years
- Accelerated growth when feeding on coral

However, these do not translate directly to an intrinsic growth rate value.

Therefore, my response is:

Search results found for log_temp_opt
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the optimal sea temperature for Crown of Thorns (Acanthaster planci) reproduction appears to be around 26°C or higher.

The first study found that the optimal breeding season for Crown of Thorns starfish in New Caledonia is concentrated around the end of the calendar year, when water temperatures reach over 26°C (Pratchett et al., 2020).

The second study also highlights the importance of adult exposure to temperature in understanding how Crown of Thorns reproduction may be impacted by global change (Pratchett et al., 2020).

The third study found that Crown of Thorns starfish can develop at temperatures between 19.4°C and 33.2°C, with an optimal thermal window for development between these temperatures (Fabricius et al., 2013).

In summary, the optimal sea temperature for Crown of Thorns reproduction appears to be around 26°C or higher, based on the findings from these studies. The starfish can develop at a wider range of temperatures, but the optimal breeding conditions seem to occur when the water reaches over 26°C.

Asking claude
Based on the search results, I'll extract the temperature values:

Relevant temperatures found:
- 26°C (optimal breeding temperature)
- 19.4°C (minimum development temperature)
- 33.2°C (maximum development temperature)

Calculating the average: (26 + 19.4 + 33.2) / 3 = 26.2°C

Since the model expects log values, I'll convert 26.2°C to its log value:

log(26.2) ≈ 1.42

Therefore, the response in the requested JSON format is:

{"min": log(19.4), "max": log(33.2), "value": 1.42}

Detailed calculation breakdown:
- min: log(19.4) ≈ 1.29
- max: log(33.2) ≈ 1.52

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the thermal tolerance range for the survival of the Crown of Thorns (Acanthaster planci) is as follows:

1. Ideal temperature range: 65°F to 85°F (18°C to 29°C) (Greg, n.d.).
2. Minimum temperature tolerance: Around 50°F (10°C), below which the Crown of Thorns may enter a dormant state or suffer damage (Greg, n.d.).
3. Thermal window for development to the late-bipinnaria stage: 25.6°C to 31.6°C (Fabricius et al., 2013).
4. Temperatures above 32°C are considered above the thermal optimum for Crown of Thorns, and prolonged exposure to such temperatures can negatively impact their performance and survival (Lamare et al., 2022).

Asking claude
I'll help you extract the numerical values for the temperature tolerance range.

Looking at the search results, I'll convert the temperatures to °C and calculate the log values:

Minimum temperature: 10°C
Maximum temperature: 32°C

Log calculation:
min log value = log(10) = 1.00
max log value = log(32) = 1.51
average log value = (1.00 + 1.51) / 2 = 1.26

Therefore, the response will be:

{"min": 1.00, "max": 1.51, "value": 1.26}

This JSON object represents:
- Minimum log temperature tolerance: 1.00
- Maximum log temperature tolerance: 1.51
- Average log temperature tolerance: 1.26

The values are derived from the temperature ranges mentioned in the search results, converted to logarithmic scale as requested.

Attempt 3 for logit_fast_pref: Predation preference between fast and slow-growing coral
Search results found for logit_fast_pref
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the available evidence suggests that crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) tend to preferentially prey on fast-growing coral species, such as Acropora, over slower-growing coral species.

The first search result indicates that "The diet preferences of COTS can influence coral community structure by predation on fast-growing genera such as Acropora and avoidance of rare coral genera" (Pratchett et al., 2023). This suggests that COTS have a predation preference for fast-growing coral species.

The second search result further supports this, noting that "The importance of predation on juvenile, post-settlement COTS by predators having a Type III functional response suggests that predator searching behaviour at small spatial scales may be critical in managing COTS outbreaks" (Uthicke et al., 2015). This implies that predators that preferentially target juvenile COTS can help manage outbreaks, which are often driven by COTS predation on fast-growing corals.

The third search result provides additional context, noting that "Intense predation by fish on massive coral species outplanted to Florida reefs has emerged as a substantial bottleneck to restoring non-Acropora corals" (Lirman et al., 2023). This suggests that slower-growing coral species may be less susceptible to predation by COTS and other predators compared to fast-growing Acropora corals.

In summary, the available evidence indicates that crown-of-thorns starfish tend to preferentially prey on fast-growing coral species, such as Acropora, over slower-growing coral species. This predation preference can influence coral community structure and the success of coral restoration efforts.

Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find any specific numerical values for the logit of preference for fast-growing coral. The text discusses qualitative preferences of crown-of-thorns starfish for fast-growing coral species like Acropora, but does not provide a quantitative logit value.

Therefore, my response is:

No relevant values found

The search results provide descriptive evidence of coral predation preferences, but do not include the specific numerical logit value requested.

**************************************************

According to the search results, fast-recovering coral species can exhibit rapid growth rates that allow them to recover coral cover and reef structure within a relatively short timeframe.

The first study found that within 4 years, fast coral growth can support a rapid recovery of coral cover from 17% to 56%, as well as a recovery in substrate rugosity (a measure of reef complexity) (Roff et al., 2023).

Similarly, the third article reports that restored coral reefs can grow at the same rate as healthy reefs after just 4 years (The Conversation, 2023). This suggests that under the right conditions, fast-growing coral species can quickly re-establish a healthy reef ecosystem.

The second study provides additional context, noting that early life stage bottlenecks (such as predation or substratum quality) can be a key factor determining the rates of coral recovery after disturbance (Doropoulos et al., 2022). This highlights the importance of addressing these early-stage challenges to facilitate rapid coral growth and recovery.

In summary, the search results indicate that fast-recovering coral species can exhibit growth rates rapid enough to restore coral cover and reef structure within 4 years under favorable conditions, as demonstrated by multiple studies (Roff et al., 2023; The Conversation, 2023; Doropoulos et al., 2022).

After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the log of fast coral growth rate (year^-1). While the results discuss coral recovery and growth rates qualitatively, they do not provide a precise logarithmic growth rate value.

The text mentions recovery of coral cover from 17% to 56% over 4 years and suggests rapid recovery, but does not translate this into a log growth rate.

Therefore, my response is:

**************************************************

Based on the search results, slow-recovering coral species tend to have very low growth rates, often less than a quarter of an inch per year. 

The first result indicates that early life stage bottlenecks, such as top-down processes and substratum quality, can drive slower rates of coral recovery after disturbance (Emslie et al. 2022).

The second result provides a specific example, noting that the slow-growing coral species studied grew an average of only 6 millimeters (0.24 inches) per year. At that rate, it would take 60 years for the coral habitat to recover (NOAA 2022).

The third result examined the growth rates of two slow-growing coral species, Pocillopora damicornis and Echinopora gemmacea. It found that these species exhibited the lowest growth rates of 1.01 ± 0.14 cm2/month and 1.73 ± 0.21 cm2/month, respectively (Ng & Chou 2016).

In summary, the search results indicate that slow-recovering coral species tend to have extremely low growth rates, often less than a quarter of an inch per year. This slow growth rate can significantly delay the recovery of coral habitats after disturbances (Emslie et al. 2022; NOAA 2022; Ng & Chou 2016).

Asking claude
Let me help you extract the log of slow coral growth rate.

First, I'll convert the given growth rates to annual rates:
1. 0.24 inches/year ≈ 0.006 m/year
2. Pocillopora damicornis: 1.01 cm²/month = 0.1212 cm²/year
3. Echinopora gemmacea: 1.73 cm²/month = 0.2076 cm²/year

To get the log of growth rate, I'll take the log of these values:
1. log(0.006) = -2.22
2. log(0.1212) = -0.92
3. log(0.2076) = -0.68

Calculating statistics:
- Min: -2.22
- Max: -0.68
- Average: -1.27

Therefore, the response in the requested JSON format would be:

{"min": -2.22, "max": -0.68, "value": -1.27}
Found values for log_r_slow: {'min': -2.22, 'max': -0.68, 'value': -1.27}
