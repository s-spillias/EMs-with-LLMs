This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interactions with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS larval survival and recruitment
2. Density-dependent COTS population growth
3. Differential predation on fast-growing (Acropora) vs slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) corals
4. Coral growth and recovery dynamics
5. Environmental thresholds triggering outbreak events

Key mechanisms:
- COTS outbreaks are triggered by enhanced larval survival in warm waters
- Population growth is limited by coral availability (bottom-up control)
- Coral recovery depends on remaining cover and growth rates
- System exhibits alternative stable states between COTS outbreak and coral dominance

The model uses annual time steps and focuses on capturing the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations while maintaining biological realism in the underlying processes.
