This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interactions with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
- Temperature-dependent larval survival and recruitment
- Density-dependent adult mortality
- Immigration of COTS larvae from external sources

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
- Different growth rates for fast (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) corals
- Selective COTS predation preferences between coral types
- Temperature-dependent coral growth and mortality

3. Environmental Drivers:
- Sea surface temperature effects on both COTS and coral populations
- Threshold effects in COTS outbreak initiation
- Environmental carrying capacities for coral growth

4. Key Mechanisms:
- Resource-dependent COTS reproduction and survival
- Coral recovery dynamics post-COTS outbreaks
- Feedback loops between coral abundance and COTS population growth

The model uses Type II functional responses for COTS predation on corals and includes smooth transitions for temperature-dependent processes. All parameters are bounded within biologically meaningful ranges using penalty functions.
