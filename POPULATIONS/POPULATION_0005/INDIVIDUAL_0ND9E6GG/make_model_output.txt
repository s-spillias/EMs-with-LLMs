You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

I'll now create the TMB model. Would you like me to proceed with the model.cpp file?

I'll create a properly structured TMB model following the conventions. Let me write the model.cpp file with proper DATA_VECTOR declarations and vector usage:

Attempt 3 for r_cots: Crown-of-thorns starfish population exponential growth potential
Search results found for r_cots
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) has a significant potential for exponential population growth:

1. Juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish exhibit exponential growth over their first year on the reef, reaching sizes up to 52.5 mm by mid-December (Uthicke et al., 2009).

2. The size ranges of juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish can increase by a factor of 3.5 from May to December, indicating rapid growth during this period (Uthicke et al., 2009).

3. Based on the periodicity (14-17 years) of past population cycles, it is expected that a new wave of crown-of-thorns starfish population irruptions will commence in the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in the near future (Pratchett et al., 2023).

4. Coral-feeding crown-of-thorns starfish exhibit accelerated growth compared to individuals that continue to feed on coralline algae, further contributing to their exponential population growth potential (Pratchett et al., 2020).

In summary, the available evidence suggests that crown-of-thorns starfish have a significant potential for exponential population growth, driven by their rapid juvenile growth rates and the cyclical nature of their population dynamics. This rapid growth and population expansion can have devastating impacts on coral reef ecosystems, making the crown-of-thorns starfish a major threat to the health and resilience of these important marine habitats.

Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a direct numerical value for the COTS intrinsic growth rate (year^-1). 

While the search results discuss growth in terms of size increase and population dynamics, they do not provide a specific intrinsic growth rate value expressed in year^-1. The results describe:
- Size increases over time
- Population cycle periodicity
- Exponential growth potential

Without a clear numerical value for intrinsic growth rate, the appropriate response is:

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the maximum sustainable population density for the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is approximately 40 starfish per hectare (ha-1) or 1,500 specimens per square kilometer (km-2).

The first source, a study published in Nature, states that "Early detection (if not prevention) of increasing starfish densities represents the best opportunity to prevent the initiation and spread of outbreaks" (Uthicke et al., 2023). This suggests that population densities above a certain threshold can lead to outbreaks that are difficult to manage.

The second source, a review article on the management of crown-of-thorns starfish, states that "if a crown-of-thorns population reaches densities >1500 specimens km−2 (Moran and De'ath, 1992), which would be referred to as an outbreak, corals may be severely damaged" (Pratchett et al., 2014). This indicates that a density of 1,500 specimens km-2 is considered the threshold for an outbreak.

The third source, a research paper on the dynamics of crown-of-thorns starfish populations, provides a more specific estimate of the maximum sustainable density, stating that it is "40 starfish per 200m2 (or 40 starfish ha-1) that is considered to be the maximum sustainable density of A. planci on reefs in the GBR (Moran and De'ath, 1992)" (Moran, 1986).

In summary, the available evidence suggests that the maximum sustainable population density for the crown-of-thorns starfish is approximately 40 starfish per hectare or 1,500 specimens per square kilometer. Densities above this threshold are considered to be outbreak levels and can lead to severe damage to coral reef ecosystems.

Let's convert the values to individuals/m^2:

Original values:
- 40 starfish per hectare (ha-1)
- 1,500 specimens per square kilometer (km-2)

Conversions:
1. 40 starfish/ha = 0.004 starfish/m^2
   (1 ha = 10,000 m^2, so 40/10,000 = 0.004)

2. 1,500 specimens/km-2 = 0.0015 specimens/m^2
   (1 km^2 = 1,000,000 m^2, so 1,500/1,000,000 = 0.0015)

These values are quite close. I'll calculate the average:

(0.004 + 0.0015) / 2 = 0.0028 individuals/m^2

**************************************************

Based on the search results, coral species can exhibit rapid colonization and recovery rates under certain conditions:

1. Artificial structures can facilitate rapid coral recovery under climate change. A study published in Nature Scientific Reports found that the creation of artificial structures can increase coral community resilience and accelerate coral recovery following disturbances like mass bleaching events (Ladd et al., 2023).

2. Coral communities can undergo rapid recovery from mass bleaching events. A study published in the journal Coral Reefs observed that following a mass bleaching event in 2016-2017, coral colonies in the Maldives showed high spawning rates (85.7% in 2018 and 90.0% in 2019), indicating a rapid recovery of the coral community (Bednarz et al., 2021).

3. The early life stage of corals can be a critical bottleneck that determines the rate of coral recovery. A study published in Ecology found that following disturbances, coral cover increased rapidly from 2010 to 2018, but the recovery rate was dependent on the survival and growth of early life stages of corals (Doropoulos et al., 2022).

In summary, the search results suggest that coral species can exhibit rapid colonization and recovery rates when provided with suitable artificial habitats, when they are able to successfully spawn and recruit following disturbances, and when early life stages of corals are able to survive and grow. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the factors that influence coral recovery dynamics in the face of climate change and other environmental stressors.

After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the intrinsic growth rate of fast-growing coral in year^-1 units.

While the search results discuss coral recovery and resilience, they do not provide a direct quantitative measurement of coral intrinsic growth rate. The results describe qualitative aspects of coral recovery, such as:
- Rapid colonization
- High spawning rates (85.7% and 90.0%)
- Coral cover increases
- Recovery dynamics

Without a specific numerical growth rate value, the appropriate response is:

Based on the search results, slow-growing corals, such as massive corals, generally have higher resilience and regeneration capacity compared to fast-growing branching corals.

The first result indicates that slow-growing massive corals are typically more thermally tolerant than fast-growing branching corals (NCBI, 2022). This higher thermal tolerance contributes to the resilience of slow-growing corals, as they are better able to withstand and recover from disturbances like coral bleaching events.

The second result further emphasizes that reefs with low resilience, such as those dominated by fast-growing corals, are less likely to regenerate quickly enough before the next disruption (DCCEEW, n.d.). In contrast, slow-growing corals have a higher capacity to regenerate and recover from disturbances.

The third result provides evidence that if predation events are reduced, massive, slow-growing corals can be successfully grown and outplanted for restoration purposes (Ladd et al., 2018). This suggests that slow-growing corals have the potential for successful regeneration and restoration, given the appropriate conditions.

In summary, the search results indicate that slow-growing corals, such as massive corals, have higher resilience and regeneration capacity compared to fast-growing branching corals. This is primarily due to their greater thermal tolerance and ability to recover from disturbances. Successful restoration of slow-growing corals is also possible, provided that predation is managed.

Based on the search results, the ideal sea temperature that triggers Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) reproduction appears to be in the range of 26-30°C.

According to the article from Naturevolution, "Acanthasters [COTS] develop best in warm waters (26 to 30°C) in the presence of phytoplankton, and can therefore be particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change" (Naturevolution).

The two articles from the Science Direct journal and the PDF further support this temperature range. They state that a +2°C warming exposure for 3-4 months can have detrimental effects on COTS eggs and fertilization success, suggesting that the optimal temperature for COTS reproduction is lower than 32°C (Figueiredo et al., 2020; Figueiredo et al., 2020).

Additionally, the articles note that COTS reproduction is affected during "sub-optimal spawning season", implying that temperatures outside the 26-30°C range are less ideal for triggering COTS reproduction (Figueiredo et al., 2020; Figueiredo et al., 2020).

In summary, the ideal sea temperature range that triggers Crown-of-thorns starfish reproduction appears to be 26-30°C, based on the information provided in the search results.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the thermal range supporting Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) population dynamics appears to be between approximately 18-32°C.

The first study found that 32°C is above the thermal optimum for Crown-of-thorns starfish, suggesting that prolonged exposure to temperatures above this level can negatively impact their performance and survival (Uthicke et al., 2022).

The second and third studies provide more detailed information on the thermal tolerance of Crown-of-thorns starfish. According to these sources, the thermal tolerance range for the early embryonic and larval (bipinnaria) stages is 18-31°C (Johnson & Babcock, 1994; Uthicke et al., 2013). Rates of abnormality in these early life stages increased steadily above 28.7°C, and reached 100% at temperatures approaching 33°C (Uthicke et al., 2013).

In summary, the available evidence suggests that the optimal thermal range for Crown-of-thorns starfish population dynamics is approximately 18-31°C, with temperatures above 32°C potentially causing significant stress and mortality, especially for the early life stages. These findings have important implications for understanding the impacts of climate change and other environmental factors on Crown-of-thorns starfish populations.

Based on the search results, I'll extract the temperature tolerance width for Crown-of-thorns starfish:

Minimum temperature: 18°C
Maximum temperature: 32°C
Temperature tolerance width: 32°C - 18°C = 14°C

Therefore, the JSON response would be:

{"min": 18.0, "max": 32.0, "value": 25.0}

The calculation follows these key points from the text:
- The thermal range is consistently reported as 18-32°C
- The optimal range is approximately 18-31°C
- Temperatures above 32°C cause significant stress
- The average (value) is calculated as (18 + 32) / 2 = 25°C

The values are already in Celsius, which matches the expected units, so no conversion is necessary.
