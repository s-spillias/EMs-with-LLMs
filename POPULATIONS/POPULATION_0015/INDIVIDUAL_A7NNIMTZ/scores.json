  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZD-style ecosystem model with many canonical processes present, but its algebraic choices differ from the TRUTH script in key ways. Uptake/growth in the candidate is implemented as multiplicative Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation times explicit light (f_I) and temperature (Q10) modifiers, whereas the TRUTH model uses a nutrient term N/(e+N) multiplied by a P-dependent term a/(b + c*P) (a different formulation). Grazing in the candidate is Holling-type (flexible exponent h, including Holling III) very similar in family to the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response. The candidate adds an explicit detritus pool with remineralization and sinking, partitions mortalities to N vs D and includes explicit excretion, quadratic zooplankton self-limitation, and Q10 & light modifiers \u2014 all not present in the TRUTH equations. Overall, most ecological roles from TRUTH are present but implemented with classical alternate formulations (Michaelis-Menten uptake, Holling grazing, linear mortality) and additional processes (detritus, temp, light, excretion, partitioning, Z quadratic loss).",
