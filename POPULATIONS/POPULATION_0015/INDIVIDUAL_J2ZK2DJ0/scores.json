  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N, P, Z) with uptake, grazing, recycling, mortalities and mixing, but uses different functional forms and extra processes. Phytoplankton growth is multiplicative (Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation \u00d7 saturating irradiance with explicit self-shading) rather than the exact a/(b + cP) form in TRUTH. Grazing is implemented as a generalized Holling (power h) with an explicit assimilation efficiency; recycling is split into unassimilated grazing, excretion, and mortality fractions. The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) modifiers and a quadratic Z density\u2011dependence not present in TRUTH. Many ecological roles are present, but several functional forms are ALTERNATE relative to TRUTH and two ecological processes are extra.",
