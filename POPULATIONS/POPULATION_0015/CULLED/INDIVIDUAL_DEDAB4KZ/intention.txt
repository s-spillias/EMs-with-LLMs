Current residuals analysis:
The model fits observed outbreak dynamics moderately well, capturing the overall boom-bust cycles of COTS. However, the current linear predation term does not capture the saturation effect that occurs when coral cover becomes highâ€”the predation rate on coral does not increase indefinitely, due to limitations such as handling time.

Chosen Improvement:
We propose replacing the original linear predation terms with a Holling type II functional response for both fast-growing and slow-growing coral. This introduces saturating predation dynamics via two new parameters (h_fast and h_slow) representing handling time. This change is ecologically justified because it better represents the limited increase in predation rate at high coral densities.

Note:
All prediction calculations continue to use previous state values only, avoiding any data leakage.
