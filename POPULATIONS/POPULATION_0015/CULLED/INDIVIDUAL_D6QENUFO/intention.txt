Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. Data fit: Residual analysis indicated that while the model captures outbreak timing moderately well, the decline in coral cover appears overly rapid.
2. Model Context: The current formulation meets many aspects of the project context; however, it oversimplifies the predation process by assuming a nearly linear consumption of coral regardless of coral density.
3. Ecological Improvement: We add a saturating predation mechanism by incorporating saturation constants for both fast-growing and slow-growing corals. In nature, predator consumption rates tend to saturate when prey density is either very high or low. This modification prevents unrealistically high coral mortality and better captures the boom‚Äêbust dynamics of COTS outbreaks.
