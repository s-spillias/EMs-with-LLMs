Assessment:
The current model effectively captures basic COTS and coral dynamics but lacks an explicit environmental modifier. Empirical evidence and ecological theory suggest that environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, nutrient availability) can significantly influence outbreak timing and magnitude. By introducing the new parameter "log_env_effect" (applied as a multiplicative factor on the intrinsic growth rate), the model now accounts for exogenous environmental factors, providing a more realistic simulation of outbreak dynamics.
