  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical NPZ roles (uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, mixing) but not identically to the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) term multiplied by a time-varying light proxy (f_L) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c P)) * P form. Recycling is handled as a single recycling fraction applied to all non-growth losses (phi_rec * ...), instead of the TRUTH's explicit additive recycling terms. Nutrient mixing (linear exchange with an external pool) matches the TRUTH. Grazing is a Hill/Holling-type functional response (generalized exponent q) similar in family to the TRUTH\u2019s P^2/(mu^2+P^2) but more flexible. Phytoplankton mortality and zooplankton linear mortality match the TRUTH's linear forms. The candidate adds an explicit seasonal light proxy (f_L) that modifies growth and grazing (an ecological process absent in TRUTH). The candidate omits an explicit mixing loss for phytoplankton (present in TRUTH as part of (s + k) * P). Numerical choices (Euler stepping, positivity penalties, soft bounds) are implementation details, not new ecological processes.",
