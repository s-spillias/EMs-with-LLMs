Assessment:
- The current model fits the data moderately well but uses a fixed steepness factor (10) in the logistic outbreak trigger function, which may be too inflexible.
- This rigidity might limit the modelâ€™s ability to capture variable outbreak initiation dynamics observed in ecological systems.
- A key oversimplification is the uniform sensitivity to outbreak triggering, which does not account for variations due to environmental or population factors.

Improvement:
- Introduce a new parameter 'outbreak_steepness' to control the rapidity of outbreak onset.
- This parameter provides additional flexibility to modulate the sensitivity of the outbreak trigger, allowing the model to better adapt to natural variability in starfish population dynamics.
