Assessment:
The current model captures key dynamics of COTS outbreaks with outbreak triggering and resource limitation via coral cover. However, the predation on coral communities is modeled in a near-linear fashion (using a division by a near-zero constant) and may not fully reflect the ecological nuance of a saturating predation response.

Chosen Improvement:
We introduce non-linear (Holling type II) predation terms by adding half-saturation constants for predation efficiency on both fast-growing and slow-growing coral groups. This modification avoids using current time step observed values and ensures that effective predation rates decline at higher coral availabilities, simulating structural refugia effects.

Ecological Justification:
Incorporating variable predation efficiency using parameters (pred_half_sat_fast and pred_half_sat_slow) better represents density-dependent responses. High coral cover can reduce effective predation through refuge effects, which in turn can influence the magnitude and duration of the COTS outbreak cycles. This enhancement provides a more realistic depiction of coral-predator interactions during burst phases.
