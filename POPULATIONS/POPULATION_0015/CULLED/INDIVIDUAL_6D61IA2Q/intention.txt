This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It captures boom-bust cycles by incorporating multiple forms of resource limitation, saturating growth functions, and threshold-mediated outbreak triggers. The model explicitly accounts for the selective predation of COTS on coral communities (fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp.), and includes feedback loops and environmental modifiers that sustain outbreak events. Critically, model predictions rely solely on lagged dynamics from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.
