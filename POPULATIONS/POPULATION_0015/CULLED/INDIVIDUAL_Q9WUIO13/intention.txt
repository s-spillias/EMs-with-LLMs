Model Summary:
1. This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. It captures the boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels and subsequently decline.
3. The model incorporates selective predation on coral communities, differentiating between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Poritidae spp.) corals.
4. Resource limitation, threshold effects, and saturating functional responses are used to represent mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreaks.
5. Indirect effects and feedback loops between COTS populations and coral cover are explicitly modeled.
