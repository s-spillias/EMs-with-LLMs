Assessment and Improvement Notes:
----------------------------------
The current model uses a fixed outbreak trigger parameter through a logistic function to simulate outbreaks, but it does not account for the dynamic influence of available coral prey.
Considering the ecological context of Crown-of-Thorns starfish outbreaks, where abundant coral supports rapid outbreak escalation and low coral abundance limits outbreak sustainability, we have introduced a feedback mechanism.
A new parameter "log_coral_modifier" is added. It is exponentiated to yield a coral modifier, which scales the outbreak trigger based on the combined fast and slow coral cover from the previous time step.
This improvement captures the resource limitation effect, ensures that only previous time step values (avoiding data leakage) are used, and better reflects the boom-bust dynamics observed.
