Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model generally captures boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks with constant predation efficiency.
However, ecological evidence suggests that as COTS densities increase, predation on corals becomes saturating due to factors such as predator interference or feeding limitations.
To capture this, we introduce a new parameter (log_K_predation) representing the log half‐saturation constant for predation.
This change implements a Michaelis–Menten type function (cots_pred[t-1] / (cots_pred[t-1] + K_predation)) for coral loss,
thereby improving the ecological realism while preventing the use of current time step response variables for predictions.
