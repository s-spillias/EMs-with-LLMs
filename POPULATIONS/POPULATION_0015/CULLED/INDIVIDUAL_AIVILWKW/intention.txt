Assessment:
The current model uses a logistic outbreak indicator to trigger rapid COTS population growth followed by decline. While it captures boom–bust cycles, it oversimplifies key ecological interactions by not accounting for resource limitation. In reality, available coral cover limits COTS reproduction after repeated predation.
Improvement:
We introduce a resource limitation mechanism by modulating COTS reproduction with the summed coral cover (fast and slow). A saturating function, defined by a new half‐saturation constant (log_K_coral), scales reproduction relative to coral availability. This addition is ecologically justified because it captures the energy limitation on starfish reproduction when coral resources dwindle.
