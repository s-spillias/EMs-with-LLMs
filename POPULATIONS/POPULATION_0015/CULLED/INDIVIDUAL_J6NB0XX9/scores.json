  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with the same core trophic flows as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth \u2192 remineralization and nutrient mixing). Many components are direct matches in family (e.g., Holling type III grazing, Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation) but parameterizations and bookkeeping differ: the candidate separates uptake vs growth by an explicit yield, adds an explicit seasonal light modifier, and includes density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality. Nutrient mixing is implemented identically (exchange with a deep reservoir). The candidate omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH (TRUTH had -(s + k)*P in dP/dt). Overall the candidate is consistent with canonical NPZ processes but contains a few extra ecological processes and different functional forms for some processes.",
