Assessment:
The current model uses a fixed logistic slope (hard-coded value of 10) for outbreak triggering, which may oversimplify the ecological dynamics controlling COTS outbreaks. Residual analysis indicates that the abrupt onset and sustained magnitude of outbreaks are not fully captured.
Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a variable logistic slope parameter, "threshold_slope", to tune the sensitivity of outbreak triggers based on previous COTS density relative to the outbreak threshold. This allows the model to better mimic the non-linear responses observed in the system under variable environmental conditions.
