Assessment:
The model initially used a logistic outbreak indicator and simple multiplicative growth to forecast COTS dynamics without explicit resource limitation.
In reality, as coral cover declines due to predation, COTS growth should decelerate because of reduced prey availability.
To better capture the boom-bust dynamics observed in COTS outbreaks, we introduce a resource limitation mechanism using a Michaelisâ€“Menten function.
The new parameter "coral_half_sat" represents the coral cover (in percentage) at which the COTS growth rate is reduced by half.
