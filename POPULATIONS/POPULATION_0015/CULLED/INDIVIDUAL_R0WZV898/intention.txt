The model currently uses a fixed logistic steepness (10) to trigger outbreak events, which may oversimplify the underlying ecology. Residual analysis indicates that flexibility in the trigger mechanism could improve fitting the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks. We introduce an 'outbreak_steepness' parameter to allow the model to capture variable sensitivity in outbreak activation. This change accounts for potential environmental modifiers and density-dependent effects that can make the outbreak response more or less abrupt. The added complexity is ecologically justified given the system dynamics.
