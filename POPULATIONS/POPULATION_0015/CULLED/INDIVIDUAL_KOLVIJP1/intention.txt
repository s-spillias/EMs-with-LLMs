Assessment:
The current model uses a logarithmic outbreak trigger based on coral cover, which does not capture the saturation of coral effects as they become very high.
Residual analysis indicates that the model tends to overestimate the impact of coral cover when high, leading to mismatches in outbreak timing and magnitude.
To better represent the dynamics, we introduce a saturating outbreak term of the form:
    theta * ((fast + slow) / (1 + phi * (fast + slow)))
This function captures a diminishing return effect â€“ as coral cover increases, its marginal influence on outbreak initiation declines.
A new parameter, phi, is introduced to control this non-linear saturation effect.
Ecologically, this is justified by the competition for other limiting resources and the inherent biological limits of outbreak intensities.
