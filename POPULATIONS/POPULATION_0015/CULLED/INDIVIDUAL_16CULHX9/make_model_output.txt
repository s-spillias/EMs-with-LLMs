You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }

 This model simulates episodic Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef.                                                                                                                                    
 It captures boom-bust cycles of COTS explosions driven by intrinsic growth, resource limitations,                                                                                                                                     
 and feedbacks from their selective predation on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Porities spp.) corals.                                                                                               
 Key ecological processes include smooth outbreak triggers, saturating functional responses, and environmental modification of rates.                                                                                                  
 The model emphasizes proper temporal lag by using past state predictions in its dynamic equations.

Search results found for log_growth_rate
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the population expansion potential of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (CoTS) can be summarized as follows:

Crown-of-Thorns starfish are known to undergo periodic population outbreaks, which can have devastating impacts on coral reef ecosystems (Recurrent population irruptions of Pacific crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS, Acanthaster cf. solaris) are among the foremost causes of coral... [Nature, 2023]).

A survey team at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) regularly assesses CoTS numbers on around 80-100 reefs each year using the manta-tow method (Planning for Crown-of-thorns Starfish Population Increases [GBRMPA, 1995]).

Researchers have developed models to project and predict CoTS population dynamics, incorporating factors such as zone-specific mortality rates to account for differences in predation (Advancing projections of crown-of-thorns starfish to support management [Science Direct, 2024]).

These models and monitoring efforts are crucial for understanding the population expansion potential of CoTS and informing management strategies to mitigate their impacts on coral reef ecosystems.

**************************************************
Asking claude
No relevant values found. While the search results discuss Crown-of-Thorns starfish population dynamics and monitoring, they do not provide a specific numerical value for the intrinsic growth rate (year^-1). To accurately determine this parameter, additional research or more specific scientific literature would be needed.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) is a major predator of coral reefs, and its outbreaks can have devastating impacts on coral ecosystems. The key findings regarding the coral consumption rate by CoTS predation are:

1. Predator removal is a primary cause of CoTS outbreaks: The "predator removal hypothesis" suggests that the removal or decline of natural predators of CoTS, such as fish and invertebrates, reduces predation pressure on the starfish, particularly at the juvenile stage, leading to outbreaks (Nature, 2021; AIMS).

2. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators can alleviate CoTS predation risk: The presence of apex predators that feed on CoTS can suppress the mesopredator (CoTS) population, reducing the risk of predation perceived by small prey, such as corals (Nature Communications, 2025).

3. Coral consumption rates during CoTS outbreaks can be extremely high: During outbreaks, CoTS can consume large amounts of coral, leading to significant damage and degradation of coral reef ecosystems. The exact consumption rates can vary depending on the size and density of the CoTS population (AIMS).

In summary, the coral consumption rate by CoTS predation is closely linked to the presence and abundance of natural predators of the starfish. Maintaining a healthy population of CoTS predators is crucial to prevent or mitigate the devastating impacts of CoTS outbreaks on coral reefs.

Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the efficiency of predation on corals by Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) as a unitless fraction.

The search results discuss COTS predation qualitatively, mentioning that:
- COTS can consume large amounts of coral during outbreaks
- Predation rates vary based on population size and density
- Natural predators can influence COTS population and predation

However, no precise numerical efficiency value is provided that would represent the fraction of coral consumed per COTS individual or per unit time.

Therefore, my response is:

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the recovery rate of coral species after predation by crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) can be relatively rapid, especially for fast-growing coral species like Acropora.

The first search result indicates that Acropora corals, which are a focal prey of crown-of-thorns starfish, have the "greatest recovery potential following mass mortality" events (Kayal et al., 2022). This suggests that Acropora corals can recover quickly after being subjected to predation by the starfish.

The second search result further supports this, noting that the management of crown-of-thorns starfish, a major coral predator, "could help corals recover following disturbances" (Doropoulos et al., 2021). This implies that removing or controlling the starfish population can facilitate the recovery of coral communities.

Additionally, the third search result highlights that "fish predators control outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish" (Clements & Hay, 2019). This natural predation of the starfish by fish can also contribute to the recovery of coral reefs following disturbances caused by crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks.

In summary, the available evidence suggests that coral species, particularly fast-growing ones like Acropora, can recover relatively quickly after predation by crown-of-thorns starfish, especially when the starfish population is managed or controlled by natural predators. The recovery potential is enhanced by the inherent resilience of certain coral species.

The search results discuss:
- Recovery potential of Acropora corals
- Management of crown-of-thorns starfish
- Coral resilience

However, no specific percentage regeneration rate is numerically stated.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, slow-growing coral species generally have lower resilience and regeneration potential compared to faster-growing branching coral species like acroporids.

The first result indicates that branching coral species are commonly used in restoration efforts because they can be easily fragmented and grow rapidly, allowing for faster recovery (NCBI, 2022). In contrast, slow-growing coral species may have more limited regeneration potential.

The second result discusses the potential of resilience-based management (RBM) to help sustain coral reefs in the face of disturbances. It suggests that supporting the resilience of coral reef ecosystems, which includes the ability of slow-growing coral species to recover, is an important consideration for management (Cvitanovic et al., 2018).

The third result highlights that increased structural complexity, which can be provided by a diversity of coral species, has demonstrated great potential for the recovery of coral species abundance and richness following disturbances (Nelson et al., 2022). This suggests that maintaining a mix of fast-growing and slow-growing coral species may be important for overall reef resilience.

In summary, the search results indicate that slow-growing coral species generally have lower resilience and regeneration potential compared to faster-growing branching corals. However, maintaining a diversity of coral species, including slow-growing species, can contribute to the overall resilience of coral reef ecosystems and their ability to recover from disturbances.
