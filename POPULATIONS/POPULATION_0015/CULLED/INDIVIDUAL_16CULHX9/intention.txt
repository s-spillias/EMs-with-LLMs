This model simulates episodic Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef. 
It captures boom-bust cycles of COTS explosions driven by intrinsic growth, resource limitations, 
and feedbacks from their selective predation on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Porities spp.) corals.
Key ecological processes include smooth outbreak triggers, saturating functional responses, and environmental modification of rates.
The model emphasizes proper temporal lag by using past state predictions in its dynamic equations.
