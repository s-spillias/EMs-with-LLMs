Assessment:
Residual analysis indicates that the fixed outbreak trigger steepness (multiplier = 10) does not sufficiently capture the variability in the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks. The current model, while incorporating resource limitation and predation effects, oversimplifies the non‚Äêlinear outbreak initiation. 

Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_slope", allowing the steepness of the logistic outbreak trigger to be estimated from data. This parameter enables flexible representation of outbreak onset, capturing ecological variability and potential environmental influences on outbreak dynamics. All predictions continue to use only previous time step states to avoid data leakage.
