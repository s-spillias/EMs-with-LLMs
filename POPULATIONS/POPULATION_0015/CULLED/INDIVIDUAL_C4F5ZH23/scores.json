  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the same core trophic architecture as the TRUTH NPZ: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, Holling type-III grazing, recycling of grazing and mortality back to nutrients, and a mixing term for nutrients. Key differences are (1) the candidate uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake times an explicit seasonal light modifier (candidate) vs. the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c P)) formulation (different nutrient/light coupling), (2) the candidate includes an explicit quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term that is not in TRUTH, and (3) the candidate omits a phytoplankton mixing/loss term present in TRUTH. The candidate also exposes more explicit parameters for assimilation, yield and excretion fractions and uses an estimation-friendly discretization and smoothing (numerical, not ecological). Overall the candidate matches TRUTH for grazing, recycling, and nutrient mixing, implements an alternate (literature-standard) form for uptake and growth (Michaelis\u2013Menten \u00d7 seasonal light), and adds density-dependent Z mortality as an extra ecological process.",
