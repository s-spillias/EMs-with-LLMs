This model simulates the coupled dynamics of nutrient (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z) concentrations in the oceanic mixed layer (units: g C m^-3). Phytoplankton growth converts dissolved nutrient into biomass under co-limitation by nutrients and light; grazing by zooplankton transfers biomass from phytoplankton to zooplankton; mortality, excretion, and unassimilated grazing products are remineralized back to dissolved nutrient. A weak vertical exchange connects the mixed layer nutrient pool to a deep reservoir, representing mixing/upwelling. Key ecological features include:

- Resource limitation: P growth follows saturating uptake for nutrients and a smooth seasonal light modifier (bounded and differentiable) for photosynthesis.
- Trophic transfer: Z grazing follows a sigmoidal (Holling type III) functional response to capture switching/handling, with an assimilation efficiency controlling transfer to Z biomass.
- Recycling and losses: Unassimilated grazing, P mortality, and Z mortality are remineralized to N with process-specific efficiencies; Z mortality includes both linear and density-dependent (quadratic) losses to reflect predation and disease.
- Environmental modulation: A smooth, seasonal light factor modulates potential P growth; a first-order exchange with a deep nutrient pool closes the mass balance and allows recovery from nutrient depletion.
- Numerical robustness: The model uses smooth floors and small constants to prevent negative states or division by zero; parameters are softly bounded within biologically plausible ranges.

Predictions are generated forward in time using Euler integration with the observed first values as initial conditions, and a lognormal observation model links predictions to data.
