Assessment:
Analysis of the current model indicates that while it captures the boom-bust dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish outbreaks, the triggering mechanism is solely based on a threshold function without considering external environmental influences. Residual analysis suggests systematic deviations during periods of known environmental fluctuation.

Improvement:
To better capture the episodic outbreak dynamics in the context of fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, nutrient levels), we introduce an environmental modifier to the intrinsic growth rate of COTS. The new parameter "env_sensitivity" scales the effect of a newly added environmental data series ("env"), providing a mechanism by which favorable conditions can amplify or dampen growth. This approach aligns with observed ecological responses and adds seasonal variability while avoiding data leakage by using lagged (previous timestep) environmental values.
