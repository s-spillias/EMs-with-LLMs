Assessment and improvement approach:                                                                                                                                                                                   

 1 The model currently uses a logarithmic function of total coral cover as the outbreak trigger, which may not capture the saturating ecological response when high coral cover no longer proportionally increases     
   outbreak risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 2 We propose replacing the logarithmic term with a saturating nonlinear function:                                                                                                                                     
   θ × (fast + slow) / (1 + β × (fast + slow))                                                                                                                                                                         
   This ensures that while increasing coral cover still triggers outbreaks, the effect levels off at high values, mimicking resource limitation and feedback mechanisms.                                               
 3 To implement this improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                      
    • In model.cpp, update the COTS dynamics equation (Equation 1) to use the new saturating function (do not use current time step coral data).                                                                       
    • In parameters.json, introduce a new parameter "beta" with a low value (e.g., 0.05) as a saturation factor with associated ecological reasoning.                                                                  
    • In intention.txt, document the assessment, ecological rationale, and the selected improvement.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                 
 - The residual analysis indicated that the current logarithmic representation of coral cover does not adequately capture the saturation in the ecological response at high coral cover levels.                        
 - Ecologically, once coral abundance reaches a high level, additional coral cover produces diminishing effects on outbreak triggering due to resource limitations and feedback mechanisms.                            
 - We have replaced the log trigger with a saturating function θ × (fast + slow) / (1 + β × (fast + slow)), where β (set to 0.05) moderates the saturation effect.                                                     
 - This modification is expected to improve the model's ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events while avoiding data leakage by only using previous time-step values.
