Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
- The residual analysis indicated that the current logarithmic representation of coral cover does not adequately capture the saturation in the ecological response at high coral cover levels.
- Ecologically, once coral abundance reaches a high level, additional coral cover produces diminishing effects on outbreak triggering due to resource limitations and feedback mechanisms.
- We have replaced the log trigger with a saturating function θ × (fast + slow) / (1 + β × (fast + slow)), where β (set to 0.05) moderates the saturation effect.
- This modification is expected to improve the model's ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events while avoiding data leakage by only using previous time-step values.
