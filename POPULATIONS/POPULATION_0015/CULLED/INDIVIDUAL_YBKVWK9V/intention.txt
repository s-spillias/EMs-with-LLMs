Assessment and Rationale:
After reviewing the model and its residuals, the current simulation appears to underestimate the rapid decline in coral cover during COTS outbreak periods. This improvement introduces a non‐linear density-dependent feedback into the coral predation process. Specifically, we add a new parameter “pred_efficiency_exponent” so that the effective predation impact becomes amplified as COTS abundance increases. Ecologically, this reflects that during outbreak peaks the per capita predation pressure on corals may increase disproportionately, leading to a more rapid coral decline. This modification is intended to better capture the boom‐bust cycles characteristic of COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef.
