Assessment and Ecological Improvement:
After evaluating the current model based on the residuals and its ability to reproduce the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, it became clear that the constant predation efficiency parameters do not adequately capture predator satiation effects when coral cover is abundant. To address this, we have incorporated a Holling Type II functional response for coral predation. Specifically, two new parameters (handling_time_fast and handling_time_slow) have been added to simulate the reduction in predation efficiency at higher coral densities. This improvement better represents the underlying ecological processes during outbreak events while ensuring all prediction calculations use only lagged (t-1) values to avoid data leakage.
