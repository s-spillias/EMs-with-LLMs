This model captures the dynamics of episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It simulates boom-bust cycles wherein COTS rapidly surge to outbreak levels and then decline, driven by intrinsic population dynamics and ecological feedbacks. The model incorporates selective predation on coral communities, distinguishing between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Porites spp.) species. Key mechanisms include:
1. Logistic growth with resource limitation and saturating responses.
2. Smooth threshold effects triggering outbreak events.
3. Environmental modulation modifying growth and predation rates.
4. Indirect feedback loops between COTS abundance and coral cover.
Small constants and smooth transitions are built in to ensure numerical stability.
