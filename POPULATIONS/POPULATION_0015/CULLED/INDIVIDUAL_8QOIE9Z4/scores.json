  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard mass-balanced NPZ with Monod nutrient limitation, a self-shading light term, generalized Holling grazing, linear mortalities and explicit recycling \u2014 so it captures the same core ecological roles as the TRUTH model but uses different functional forms and some additional processes. Key differences: uptake is cast as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) term times a 1/(1+alpha*P) light factor (TRUTH used a different algebraic light factor a/(b + c P)); grazing is a generalized Holling with an added smooth threshold and a free exponent h (TRUTH used a specific P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form); recycling is implemented as explicit gross uptake U with a phytoplankton assimilation efficiency (epsilon_P) and explicit unassimilated grazing returning to nutrients (1-e_Z)*G (TRUTH partitions grazing and returns with alpha/beta parameters but does not separate gross uptake and phytoplankton respiration in the same way); the candidate adds seasonal modulation of growth and grazing rates (not present in TRUTH). The candidate omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and for plankton matching the TRUTH formulation (TRUTH has k*(N0 - N) and (s + k)*P). Numerically, the candidate uses forward Euler discrete updates, smooth floors and an explicit observation model (lognormal), which are implementation details but affect behavior versus the continuous ODE TRUTH model.",
