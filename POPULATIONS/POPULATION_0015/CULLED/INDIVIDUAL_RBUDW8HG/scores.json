  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a richer NPZD-style model that preserves the core ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ (nutrient uptake, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, linear mortalities, and nutrient mixing) but uses alternate mathematical forms for several processes and adds new state/process components. Uptake is explicit Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) with an added seasonal light factor and an allocation efficiency (e_P). Grazing is a generalized Holling-type saturating response with a tunable exponent (q = 1+nu) so it can reproduce Type II or Type III behavior. Recycling is handled mechanistically by splitting non-growth losses into immediate recycling vs detritus and by including an explicit detritus pool with remineralization and export. Nutrient mixing is present and matches the TRUTH mixing form in structure. Several components (detritus, explicit direct vs detritus recycling, seasonal light forcing, allocation efficiency) are extra relative to the TRUTH model.",
