Below are the changes corresponding to the chosen improvement: We assess that the current model effectively captures the key dynamics but hardcodes the sharpness of the outbreak indicator (via the logistic function)
using a factor of 10. In reality, the abruptness of an outbreak may vary by location or environmental conditions. To better capture this variability, we propose adding a new parameter—outbreak_sensitivity—which     
modulates the steepness of the logistic function that triggers outbreaks. This improvement enables flexible calibration of outbreak onset, thereby capturing variability in the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS
outbreaks.

 After evaluating the current model, it appears that while the model captures the overall boom-bust cycle of Crown-of-Thorns starfish outbreaks reasonably well, the hardcoded logistic steepness (a factor of 10) for 
 triggering outbreaks may be too inflexible. Outbreak occurrence is influenced by variable environmental conditions and ecological factors.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 To improve the model’s ecological relevance, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_sensitivity", which allows the logistic function controlling the outbreak trigger to adapt its steepness. This addition provides 
 more realistic representation of outbreak initiation variability, allowing the model to better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events across diverse reef conditions.
