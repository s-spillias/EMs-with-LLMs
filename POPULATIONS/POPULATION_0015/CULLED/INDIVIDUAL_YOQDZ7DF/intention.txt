Assessment and Reasoning:

After evaluating the current model, it appears that while the model captures the overall boom-bust cycle of Crown-of-Thorns starfish outbreaks reasonably well, the hardcoded logistic steepness (a factor of 10) for triggering outbreaks may be too inflexible. Outbreak occurrence is influenced by variable environmental conditions and ecological factors. 

To improve the modelâ€™s ecological relevance, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_sensitivity", which allows the logistic function controlling the outbreak trigger to adapt its steepness. This addition provides a more realistic representation of outbreak initiation variability, allowing the model to better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events across diverse reef conditions.
