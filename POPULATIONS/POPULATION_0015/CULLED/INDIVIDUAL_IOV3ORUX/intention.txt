Assessment:
The current model implements a logistic outbreak trigger that modulates COTS growth but the residual analysis indicates that the transition into outbreak regimes is not as sharp or flexible as observed in ecological data.
  
Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_curvature", to independently adjust the curvature of the outbreak trigger. This allows us to fine-tune the rapid onset (and termination) of outbreaks without altering the overall threshold set by "log_outbreak_threshold". Ecologically, this reflects the complex non-linear processes driving outbreak dynamics and enhances the model's realism regarding the boom-bust cycles in COTS populations.
