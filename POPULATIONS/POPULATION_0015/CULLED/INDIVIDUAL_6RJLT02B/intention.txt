Assessment and improvement rationale:
1. Residual analysis indicates that while the model captures overall COTS trends, it under-represents the rapid crash following outbreak peaks.
2. The current framework lacks a mechanism for density-dependent mortality, which is known to drive the boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations.
3. We introduce a density-dependent mortality term (quadratic in COTS abundance) to better capture intra-specific competition and outbreak crashes.
4. A new parameter, log_dd (with dd = exp(log_dd)), is added to represent this effect.
