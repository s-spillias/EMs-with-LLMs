  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ framework with uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality and mixing, but parameterizes processes differently from the TRUTH script. Uptake/growth are Michaelis-Menten style (multiplicative with explicit light and temperature modifiers), grazing is Holling-type III (explicitly parameterized with exponent h), and recycling is split into assimilation (e_Z), unassimilated flux to N, mortality remineralization fractions, and an independent excretion term. Some TRUTH terms map directly (mixing to nutrients), some are alternate formulations (explicit f_I and Q10 modifiers), and some TRUTH terms are absent (explicit phytoplankton mixing loss). The candidate also adds extra ecological processes (temperature/Q10 on rates, light limitation, quadratic zooplankton self-limitation, and an independent zooplankton excretion term).",
