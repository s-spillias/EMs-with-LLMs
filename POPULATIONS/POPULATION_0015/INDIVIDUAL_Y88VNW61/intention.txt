Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
Residual analysis revealed that the model tends to underestimate the steepness of outbreak onset.
The current hard-coded logistic function (using a slope of 10) may be too rigid. To better capture the timing,
magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, we introduce a flexible parameter ("outbreak_slope") to control the steepness 
of the outbreak activation. This change allows the logistic trigger to adjust dynamically, reflecting ecological variability 
and environmental modifiers that affect outbreak dynamics.
