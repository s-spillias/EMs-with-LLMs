Current Assessment:
- The model uses a logistic outbreak indicator and resource limitation mechanism that captures basic boom-bust dynamics.
- However, it does not incorporate any environmental modifiers that may affect the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce an environmental effect parameter (`env_effect`) which modulates the outbreak sensitivity in the logistic function.
- This parameter is intended to capture influences such as temperature anomalies, providing an indirect feedback mechanism that can trigger or sustain outbreaks.
