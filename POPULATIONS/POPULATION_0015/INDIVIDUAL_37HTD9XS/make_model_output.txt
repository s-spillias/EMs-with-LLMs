Below are the proposed changes. We are going to document our ecological assessment and improvement in intention.txt, add a new parameter in parameters.json for an environmental effect, and update model.cpp in two   
spots: one to declare and read the new parameter and one to incorporate it into the outbreak indicator function. This change is justified ecologically because our model now accounts for environmental modifiers      
(e.g., water temperature anomalies) that can influence the triggering and persistence of COTS outbreaks.

 - The model uses a logistic outbreak indicator and resource limitation mechanism that captures basic boom-bust dynamics.                                                                                              
 - However, it does not incorporate any environmental modifiers that may affect the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.

 - Introduce an environmental effect parameter (`env_effect`) which modulates the outbreak sensitivity in the logistic function.                                                                                       
 - This parameter is intended to capture influences such as temperature anomalies, providing an indirect feedback mechanism that can trigger or sustain outbreaks.
