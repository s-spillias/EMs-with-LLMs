My Assessment:
--------------
The current model uses a logistic threshold function to represent outbreak dynamics and a Michaelisâ€“Menten form for resource limitation. While these choices capture key aspects of COTS boom-bust cycles and coral predation, the resource limitation formulation is oversimplified. Coral competition and resource uptake can exhibit sharper, non-linear responses that influence outbreak timing and magnitude.

To better capture these dynamics, I propose adding a new non-linear parameter, resource_exponent, to modify the coral resource limitation term. This exponent allows the model to adjust the curvature of the resource uptake function, providing more flexibility to capture rapid changes in effective resource availability as coral cover changes. This improvement is ecologically justified by the need to account for competitive interactions and non-linear resource consumption, thereby enhancing the prediction of outbreak dynamics.
