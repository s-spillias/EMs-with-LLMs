  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, mortality) but uses different functional forms from the TRUTH model for several terms and omits explicit physical mixing. Uptake/growth are Michaelis\u2013Menten in N combined with an explicit light limitation (a process absent from TRUTH). Grazing is Holling type II (alternate to TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form). Recycling is present but routed from mortality rather than the exact grazing/excretion terms in TRUTH. The candidate also includes explicit temperature dependence machinery (Arrhenius) and a quadratic zooplankton mortality term that are not in the TRUTH model.",
