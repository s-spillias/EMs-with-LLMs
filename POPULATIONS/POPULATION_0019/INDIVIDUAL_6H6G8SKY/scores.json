  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but differs from the TRUTH model in key mechanistic choices. Uptake/growth are implemented as Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation co-limited by an explicit light limitation (depth-integrated irradiance with self-shading), whereas TRUTH uses a nutrient-saturation term combined with a P-dependent factor (P^1 in denominator) and no light. Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (P/(K+P)), while TRUTH uses a squared Hill-type functional response P^2/(mu^2+P^2). Both models include assimilation-driven zooplankton growth and linear phytoplankton mortality, but the candidate adds quadratic zooplankton mortality and omits the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term in nutrients and phytoplankton. Recycling is present in the candidate but routed only from mortality (and scaled by a bounded gamma), not explicitly from unassimilated grazing as in TRUTH. Numerically the candidate uses an Euler forward integrator and soft priors / observation-error structure (TMB), which are implementation-level differences but not ecological processes.",
