  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same three-state NPZ structure but uses different functional forms and bookkeeping compared with the TRUTH Python model. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a Monod/Michaelis-Menten term (no explicit light/self-shading limitation), grazing is Holling type II (TRUTH uses Holling type III with P^2), and zooplankton growth uses an assimilation efficiency in the usual way. The candidate explicitly includes zooplankton excretion and a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term that are not present in the TRUTH model. The candidate omits the TRUTH nutrient mixing/entrainment term and omits an explicit recycling of the unassimilated fraction of grazing (the TRUTH 'beta' recycling of grazed P).",
