  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the main ecological roles of a simple NPZ: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Michaelis\u2013Menten form), grazing by zooplankton (Holling Type II), assimilation of grazed carbon into zooplankton biomass (efficiency e), linear mortality for P and Z, and partitioning of non-assimilated grazing into fast recycling vs sinking export (f_sink). It differs from the TRUTH model in key structural ways: TRUTH uses a multiplicative light/self-shading term a/(b + c*P) (and a P^2-type saturating grazing function) while the candidate omits that light/self-shading factor and uses a standard Holling II grazing (g_max * P/(K_P + P)). The candidate also omits environmental mixing/entrainment terms for nutrients and zooplankton present in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and k*P respectively), and uses an explicit fecal-pellet sinking partition (f_sink) not present in the TRUTH code. Implementation notes: the candidate uses forward Euler time-stepping and an observation likelihood / parameter-penalty framework (TMB) rather than a continuous ODE solver; those are modeling/implementation details rather than new ecological processes.",
