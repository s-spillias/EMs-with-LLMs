  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the major ecological roles from the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth/mortality) but uses different mathematical choices for several terms and omits explicit physical mixing for nutrients and phytoplankton. Notable differences: (1) uptake/co\u2011limitation is implemented with a harmonic-mean style co-limitation of Monod nutrient and Monod light terms rather than the TRUTH multiplicative N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) form; (2) grazing is a standard Holling II (P/(K_Z+P)) rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturation; (3) recycling is implemented as fraction of linear mortality (remineralization of P and Z mortalities) rather than explicit return from unassimilated grazing and other TRUTH recycling terms; (4) the candidate adds explicit temperature dependence (Arrhenius modifiers) and a mechanistic depth-averaged light calculation (I_avg with k_w, k_p, MLD). Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and matches TRUTH for linear mortalities and assimilation-structure for zooplankton growth, but differs in uptake/grazing forms and lacks mixing terms present in the TRUTH nutrient and phytoplankton equations.",
