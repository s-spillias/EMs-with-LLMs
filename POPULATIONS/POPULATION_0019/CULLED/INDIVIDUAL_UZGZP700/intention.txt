MODEL ASSESSMENT:

Current State:
- The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework
- Uses Monod kinetics for nutrient uptake and Holling Type II for grazing
- All efficiency parameters (epsilon_P, epsilon_Z, gamma) are at placeholder values (0.0)
- After logit transformation, these become ~0.5, representing moderate efficiencies
- Mortality rates are equal for phytoplankton and zooplankton (0.05 day^-1)

Critical Missing Process:
The model lacks LIGHT LIMITATION for phytoplankton growth, which is fundamental in oceanic mixed layer dynamics. In marine systems, phytoplankton are typically co-limited by both nutrients and light availability.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Light Limitation

Ecological Justification:
1. In the oceanic mixed layer, light availability is a primary driver of phytoplankton productivity
2. Light limitation varies with:
   - Depth of the mixed layer
   - Solar irradiance (seasonal and daily cycles)
   - Water turbidity and self-shading by phytoplankton
3. Co-limitation by light and nutrients is well-documented in marine ecology
4. This can explain spring blooms (high light, high nutrients) and summer stratification effects

Mathematical Implementation:
- Add parameter I (light intensity, μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
- Add parameter K_I (half-saturation constant for light, μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
- Modify phytoplankton growth to include multiplicative light limitation:
  
  uptake = r_P * (N / (K_N + N)) * (I / (K_I + I)) * P
  
  This represents Liebig's Law of the Minimum in a smooth, multiplicative form

Expected Outcomes:
- More realistic seasonal dynamics
- Better representation of bloom initiation and termination
- Improved model fit when light data is available
- Ability to explore light-nutrient co-limitation scenarios

Parameter Additions:
- I: Light intensity (data vector or constant)
- K_I: Half-saturation for light uptake (literature-based, typically 20-100 μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)

This improvement maintains model simplicity while adding critical ecological realism for oceanic plankton dynamics.
