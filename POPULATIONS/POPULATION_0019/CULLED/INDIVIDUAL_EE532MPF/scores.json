  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but uses different algebraic choices vs the TRUTH model. Phytoplankton growth is implemented via Liebig minimum between an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light average and a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term (so it is an alternate formulation of light+nutrient limitation). Grazing is Holling Type II and zooplankton growth uses an assimilation efficiency of grazing (alternate to the TRUTH saturating quadratic grazing). Mortality terms are present (linear P mortality and linear+quadratic Z mortality). Important TRUTH components that are missing in the candidate are an explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N)) and an explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss. The candidate does add density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality not in TRUTH.",
