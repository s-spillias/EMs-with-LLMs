  "qualitative_description": "The candidate TMB model implements an NPZ structure with all three state variables and includes nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, recycling, and zooplankton growth. However, many mechanistic details differ from the TRUTH model: uptake/growth are formulated as a nutrient Monod \u00d7 explicit light limitation combined via a harmonic-mean co-limitation (theta) rather than the TRUTH product (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P)). Grazing is a standard Holling type II in the candidate instead of the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH. The candidate adds several ecological/physical processes not in the TRUTH model (explicit light self-shading and mixed-layer averaging, Q10 temperature scaling, a phytoplankton assimilation efficiency parameter, and separate phytoplankton recycling fraction). The candidate also omits the TRUTH environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient equation and the explicit mixing loss for phytoplankton. Overall: core roles are present, some components match TRUTH exactly (linear mortalities, absence/presence of Z-mixing), many are valid alternates (Michaelis-Menten uptake, Holling-II grazing), and several extra ecological processes are added.",
