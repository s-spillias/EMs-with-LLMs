MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system with:
- Nutrient limitation (Monod kinetics)
- Light limitation with self-shading and depth-averaging
- Flexible co-limitation (harmonic mean with theta parameter)
- Zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II)
- Differential nutrient recycling from mortality

IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
1. I_0 parameter has unrealistic value (886 W/m²) and is essentially fixed - typical oceanic PAR is 50-400 W/m²
2. All biological rates (r_P, g_max, m_P, m_Z) are temperature-independent, which is unrealistic for oceanic systems
3. Ocean plankton metabolism is strongly temperature-dependent with well-established Q10 relationships

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Temperature-Dependent Rate Modulation Framework
Add temperature dependence infrastructure using Q10 formulation:
  rate(T) = rate_ref × Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Temperature affects all enzymatic processes in plankton
- Q10 values for marine plankton typically range 1.5-3.0 (well-established in literature)
- Enables realistic seasonal dynamics in temperate/polar oceans
- Critical for capturing bloom timing and magnitude
- Allows model to respond to climate warming scenarios

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Add Q10 parameter (expected range 1.5-3.0, with prior centered at 2.0)
2. Add T_ref (reference temperature, typically 15-20°C for oceanic plankton)
3. Modify rate calculations: r_P, g_max, m_P, m_Z all become temperature-dependent
4. Fix I_0 bounds to realistic range [50, 500] W/m²
5. Currently uses T_ref as constant temperature (temp_factor = 1.0) until temperature data is provided
6. Framework is ready for future integration of temperature time series data

CURRENT STATUS:
- Temperature framework implemented but using constant temperature (T_ref)
- This maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- When temperature data becomes available, simply add T_dat as DATA_VECTOR and modify T_current calculation
- All biological rates are now expressed at reference temperature and ready for temperature modulation

EXPECTED OUTCOMES (when temperature data is added):
- Better fit to seasonal data patterns
- More realistic representation of oceanic plankton dynamics
- Improved predictive capability across temperature gradients
- Foundation for climate change scenario testing

MATHEMATICAL CHANGES:
- r_P_effective = r_P × Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)
- g_max_effective = g_max × Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)
- m_P_effective = m_P × Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)
- m_Z_effective = m_Z × Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)
- Currently: T = T_ref, so all effective rates equal base rates

This maintains the existing model structure while adding a fundamental ecological process framework that is critical for oceanic mixed layer plankton dynamics. The implementation is backward compatible and ready for temperature data integration.
