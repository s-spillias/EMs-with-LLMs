  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core three-state dynamics (N, P, Z) with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality and recycling, but several process formulations differ from the TRUTH Python model. Key differences: phytoplankton growth in the candidate is a single Monod/ Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation (no light/self-shading term a/(b + c*P) present in TRUTH); grazing is implemented as Holling type II (TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form); recycling is formulated as returns from linear mortality of P and Z (gamma_P_bounded * P_loss + gamma_Z_bounded * Z_loss) rather than the TRUTH's explicit grazing-related return and separate r*P term; the candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt and dP/dt present in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and mixing term in P losses). The candidate also adds an explicit phytoplankton assimilation efficiency parameter (epsilon_P) that scales uptake into P and N, which is not present in TRUTH. Statistical/estimation features (priors, observation error, Euler integration) are present but are not ecological processes.",
