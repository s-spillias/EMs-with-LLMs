  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Monod-style nutrient uptake, an explicit light-limitation submodel (depth-averaged I_avg with self-shading), Holling type II grazing, linear mortality for P and Z, and mortality-based recycling. It omits the explicit environmental mixing/dilution term present in the TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) in dN/dt and the k component in P losses). Recycling is implemented only as a fraction of mortality (gamma_P_bounded * P_loss + gamma_Z_bounded * Z_loss) and does not include an explicit term for unassimilated grazing losses returning to nutrients as in TRUTH. Numerically, the candidate uses an Euler forward integrator and includes observation error in the likelihood (implementation/estimation details, not ecological processes). Overall the candidate matches many canonical roles (uptake, grazing, mortality, assimilation) but differs in functional forms (explicit light co-limitation and Holling II grazing vs. TRUTH's quadratic-saturating grazing and the TRUTH nutrient uptake formulation) and is missing the mixing/entrainment term from the TRUTH model.",
