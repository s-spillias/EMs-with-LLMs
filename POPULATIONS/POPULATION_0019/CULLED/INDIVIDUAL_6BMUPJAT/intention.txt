MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing NPZ model implements standard plankton dynamics with Monod nutrient uptake and Holling Type II grazing. However, for an oceanic mixed layer context, it lacks a critical limiting factor: light availability.

IDENTIFIED GAP:
Phytoplankton growth currently depends only on nutrient concentration (Monod kinetics). In reality, oceanic phytoplankton are co-limited by both nutrients AND light. The absence of light limitation means:
1. Unrealistic growth at depth where light is insufficient
2. No self-shading effects (phytoplankton reducing light for themselves)
3. Missing seasonal dynamics driven by light availability
4. No representation of mixed layer depth effects on productivity

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Depth-Integrated Light Limitation
Add light limitation to phytoplankton growth using a depth-averaged formulation that accounts for:

EQUATION MODIFICATION:
Replace simple nutrient limitation with multiplicative nutrient-light co-limitation:
- Growth = r * (N/(K_N + N)) * (Light_limitation) * P

Light limitation calculated as:
- Light_limitation = (I_0/k_d/H) * (1 - exp(-k_d * H)) / H
  where:
  - I_0 = surface light intensity (Î¼mol photons m^-2 s^-1)
  - k_d = total light attenuation coefficient = k_w + k_c * P
  - k_w = background water attenuation (m^-1)
  - k_c = phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (m^2 g^-1 C)
  - H = mixed layer depth (m)

This formulation:
1. Integrates light over the mixed layer depth
2. Accounts for exponential light decay (Beer-Lambert law)
3. Includes self-shading (k_c * P term)
4. Provides realistic depth-averaged light availability

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
- I_0: Surface light intensity (seasonal forcing possible)
- k_w: Background water light attenuation
- k_c: Phytoplankton-specific attenuation (self-shading)
- H: Mixed layer depth

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Light is co-equal with nutrients in limiting marine primary production
2. Self-shading creates negative feedback, preventing unrealistic phytoplankton blooms
3. Mixed layer depth is a key physical control on productivity
4. This formulation is standard in marine ecosystem models (e.g., NPZD models)
5. Enables realistic seasonal cycles and bloom dynamics

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- More realistic phytoplankton growth dynamics
- Self-limiting blooms through light competition
- Better representation of mixed layer ecology
- Foundation for adding seasonal light variation in future iterations

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
The light limitation term will be calculated at each time step and multiplied with the existing nutrient limitation term, creating co-limitation following Liebig's Law of the Minimum (implemented as multiplicative limitation).
