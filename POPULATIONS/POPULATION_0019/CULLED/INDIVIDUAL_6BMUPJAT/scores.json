  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, mortalities, recycling) but uses different mathematical choices for several canonical processes. Uptake/growth are represented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation combined with an explicit depth\u2011integrated light factor (alternate to the TRUTH model's simpler self\u2011shading term). Grazing is Holling type II (saturating with P in the denominator) rather than the TRUTH Holling\u2011type III / P^2/(mu^2+P^2). Recycling is present (mortalities + inefficient grazing) but the candidate lacks the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations that exists in the TRUTH model. Zooplankton mortality (linear) matches TRUTH and zooplankton mixing is absent in both models (so they match on that absence). The candidate also contains statistical/estimation machinery (observation likelihood, soft parameter penalties) and an explicit depth\u2011integrated light formulation \u2014 these are modelling/implementation differences rather than new ecological state variables.",
