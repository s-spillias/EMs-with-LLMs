MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current NPZ model captures the basic trophic interactions between nutrients, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. However, it lacks a critical limiting factor for phytoplankton growth in oceanic mixed layers: light availability.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
1. Phytoplankton growth is only limited by nutrient availability (Michaelis-Menten kinetics)
2. The updated literature value for log_r (-0.02041, ~0.98 day⁻¹) represents a high maximum growth rate
3. Without light limitation, the model could produce unrealistic phytoplankton blooms when nutrients are abundant
4. Light attenuation and self-shading are fundamental processes in oceanic mixed layers

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add light limitation to phytoplankton growth using a depth-integrated light availability term based on the Beer-Lambert law. This modification:

1. Introduces average light availability in the mixed layer (I_avg) as a function of:
   - Surface irradiance (I_0)
   - Background light attenuation coefficient (k_w) - water and dissolved matter
   - Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (k_p) - attenuation per unit phytoplankton biomass
   - Mixed layer depth (H)

2. Light limitation factor: L = I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)
   - K_I is the half-saturation constant for light-limited growth
   - This creates a saturating response to light availability

3. Modified phytoplankton growth becomes:
   uptake = r * (N / (K_N + N)) * (I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)) * P
   
   This represents co-limitation by both nutrients AND light (multiplicative Liebig-style limitation)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Light is a primary limiting factor for phytoplankton in oceanic systems
- Self-shading creates negative feedback on phytoplankton growth at high densities
- This mechanism is well-documented in oceanographic literature
- Prevents unrealistic blooms and adds realism to seasonal dynamics
- The multiplicative form represents co-limitation where both resources must be available

NEW PARAMETERS:
- I_0: Surface light intensity (W m⁻²) - typically 100-400 W m⁻²
- k_w: Background water attenuation coefficient (m⁻¹) - typically 0.04-0.2 m⁻¹
- k_p: Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (m⁻¹ (g C m⁻³)⁻¹) - typically 0.01-0.1
- K_I: Half-saturation for light (W m⁻²) - typically 20-50 W m⁻²
- H: Mixed layer depth (m) - typically 10-100 m, could be data input or parameter

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Average light in mixed layer: I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-(k_w + k_p * P) * H)) / ((k_w + k_p * P) * H)
Light limitation factor: L = I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)
Modified uptake: uptake = r * (N / (K_N + N)) * L * P

This represents a moderate complexity increase with strong ecological foundation and addresses a fundamental gap in the current model structure.
