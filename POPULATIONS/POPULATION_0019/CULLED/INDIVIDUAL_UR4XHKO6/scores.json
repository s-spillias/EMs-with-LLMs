  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements all three state dynamics (N, P, Z) with ecologically plausible terms, but it is not algebraically equivalent to the TRUTH Python model. Phytoplankton growth is implemented as a product of Monod\u2010type nutrient limitation and an explicit, depth-averaged Beer\u2013Lambert light limitation (i.e., multiplicative co-limitation) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) form. Grazing is a classic Holling type II (P/(K_Z+P)) in place of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) saturating form. Mortality terms for P and Z are linear in both models and thus match the TRUTH linear mortality structure. Important differences: (1) the candidate lacks any explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for N or P (TRUTH has k*(N0 - N) and a mixing loss in P), (2) recycling in the candidate is a simple fraction of mortality (gamma_bounded*(P_loss + Z_loss)) and does not include explicit recycling/excretion from grazing as in the TRUTH, and (3) the candidate introduces an explicit phytoplankton assimilation/uptake efficiency parameter (epsilon_P_bounded) that partitions uptake between N drawdown and P assimilation (TRUTH has uptake placed directly into P without this partition). The candidate also contains many fitting/implementation items (soft priors, observation-error parameters, Euler integration) that are not ecological processes.",
