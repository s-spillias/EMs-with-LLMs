  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same broad ecological roles as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth; grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth; linear mortalities and recycling), but several mechanistic formulations differ. The candidate uses an explicit light module (I_0, k_w, k_c, MLD) and a multiplicative nutrient \u00d7 light limitation (Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation \u00d7 saturating light) rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) factor. The candidate implements grazing as a Holling Type II functional response and uses linear mortality recycling only from death (gamma_bounded * (P_loss + Z_loss)), whereas the TRUTH model includes grazing-based recycling terms (beta * lambda_ * P^2/(mu^2+P^2) * Z) and an explicit mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N). The candidate therefore matches many ecological roles but differs in key process forms and omits an explicit physical mixing term and grazing-derived nutrient recycling present in TRUTH.",
