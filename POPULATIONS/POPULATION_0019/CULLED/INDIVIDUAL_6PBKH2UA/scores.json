  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth -> grazing -> zooplankton growth -> recycling) but uses different functional forms in several places compared with the TRUTH NPZ. Nutrient uptake/growth is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term multiplied by an explicit depth\u2011integrated light limitation (I_0, k_w, k_c, H) rather than the TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) self\u2011shading form. Grazing is Holling type II in the candidate (g_max*P/(K_P+P)), whereas TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) (type\u2011III) style term. The candidate includes recycling from phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton mortality and inefficient grazing, but it omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton. The candidate also includes an extra quadratic density\u2011dependent zooplankton mortality term and an explicit depth\u2011averaged light calculation that are not in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches many ecological roles but uses alternate functional families for several canonical processes.",
