MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with light limitation and self-shading effects. The core ecological processes are well-represented, but there is a critical missing component: temperature dependence of biological rates.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. The I_0 parameter was updated to 886 W m^-2, which represents full solar irradiance rather than PAR (photosynthetically active radiation). This is unrealistically high for photosynthesis calculations.
2. All biological rates (r_P, g_max, m_P, m_Z) are currently temperature-independent, which is ecologically unrealistic.
3. Temperature is a fundamental driver of plankton metabolism, affecting all rate processes through Q10 relationships.

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: Temperature-Dependent Rate Modification

JUSTIFICATION:
Temperature controls metabolic rates in ectothermic organisms like plankton. The Q10 principle states that biological rates approximately double for every 10°C increase in temperature. This is critical for:

1. SEASONAL DYNAMICS: Temperate and polar oceans show strong seasonal temperature variation (0-25°C), which drives bloom timing and magnitude.

2. VERTICAL STRUCTURE: Temperature decreases with depth, affecting rates differently in surface vs. deep mixed layers.

3. CLIMATE RELEVANCE: Warming oceans alter plankton phenology and productivity.

4. REGIONAL VARIATION: Different oceanic regions (tropical vs. polar) have fundamentally different temperature regimes.

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Using Q10 formulation: rate(T) = rate_ref * Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)

Where:
- rate_ref = reference rate at reference temperature T_ref
- Q10 = temperature coefficient (typically 1.5-3.0 for biological processes)
- T = ambient temperature (°C)
- T_ref = reference temperature (typically 15-20°C for temperate species)

AFFECTED PROCESSES:
1. Phytoplankton growth rate (r_P): Q10 typically 1.8-2.5
2. Zooplankton grazing rate (g_max): Q10 typically 2.0-3.0
3. Phytoplankton mortality (m_P): Q10 typically 1.5-2.0
4. Zooplankton mortality (m_Z): Q10 typically 1.5-2.0

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
- T_water: Water temperature (°C) - DATA_VECTOR or PARAMETER depending on availability
- Q10_P: Temperature coefficient for phytoplankton growth (dimensionless, typically 2.0)
- Q10_Z: Temperature coefficient for zooplankton grazing (dimensionless, typically 2.5)
- Q10_mort: Temperature coefficient for mortality rates (dimensionless, typically 1.8)
- T_ref: Reference temperature for rate parameters (°C, typically 15-20°C)

ECOLOGICAL REALISM:
This modification maintains the existing model structure while adding a well-established physiological constraint. Temperature dependence is one of the most fundamental and well-documented ecological relationships, with extensive empirical support from laboratory cultures and field observations.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
1. Better fit to seasonal data with temperature variation
2. More realistic bloom timing in temperate systems
3. Improved representation of temperature-stratified environments
4. Enhanced predictive capability under climate change scenarios

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- If temperature data is available as a time series, use DATA_VECTOR
- If temperature is constant or unknown, use PARAMETER with appropriate prior
- Reference rates (r_P, g_max, m_P, m_Z) now represent values at T_ref
- Q10 values should have informative priors based on physiological literature
