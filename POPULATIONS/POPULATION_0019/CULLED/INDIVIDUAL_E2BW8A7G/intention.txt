MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The current NPZ model implements basic plankton dynamics with:
- Nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Monod kinetics)
- Zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II functional response)
- Linear mortality for both trophic levels
- Nutrient recycling from dead organic matter

MODEL FIT ASSESSMENT:
Without access to residuals, the baseline model provides a foundation for understanding NPZ dynamics. The model structure is ecologically sound but simplified.

IDENTIFIED LIMITATION:
The model only considers nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth, which is ecologically incomplete for oceanic mixed layer systems. In reality, phytoplankton growth in the mixed layer is co-limited by BOTH nutrients and light availability.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT (FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION):
Add light limitation to phytoplankton growth using a multiplicative limitation framework when light data becomes available.

CURRENT MODEL STRUCTURE:
The model currently uses nutrient-only limitation:
  uptake = r_P * (N / (K_N + N)) * P

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT (when light data is available):
The model can be extended to include light co-limitation:
  uptake = r_P * (N / (K_N + N)) * (I / (K_I + I)) * P

Where:
- I = light intensity (W m^-2 or Î¼mol photons m^-2 s^-1)
- K_I = half-saturation constant for light (same units as I)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR FUTURE LIGHT ADDITION:
1. Light is a fundamental requirement for photosynthesis
2. In the mixed layer, light availability decreases with depth due to absorption and scattering
3. Seasonal variation in solar radiation drives phytoplankton phenology
4. Co-limitation by light and nutrients is well-documented in oceanographic literature
5. This addition will improve model realism for seasonal dynamics

PARAMETER K_I:
K_I is included in the parameter set (value: 30.0 W m^-2) as a placeholder for future model enhancement when light data becomes available. It is not currently used in calculations but represents typical half-saturation values for marine phytoplankton from literature.

CURRENT MODEL BEHAVIOR:
- The model functions with nutrient limitation only
- All ecological processes (grazing, mortality, recycling) are implemented
- Parameter estimation will optimize rates and efficiencies based on observed NPZ dynamics
- The model is ready for light data integration when available

EXPECTED IMPACT OF CURRENT MODEL:
- Captures basic NPZ dynamics and trophic interactions
- Provides baseline parameter estimates for growth, grazing, and mortality rates
- Establishes nutrient cycling patterns
- Can be enhanced with light limitation when data becomes available
