  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core three\u2011compartment structure (N, P, Z) and includes nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling processes. However its functional forms differ from the TRUTH model in important ways: uptake is a simple Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) term with no explicit light limitation (the TRUTH model multiplies nutrient limitation by a P\u2011dependent light term a/(b + c*P)); grazing is Holling Type II (TRUTH uses a saturating P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form); mixing/entrainment of nutrients and physical loss terms for P and Z present in TRUTH are missing in the candidate. The candidate adds an explicit phytoplankton assimilation efficiency (epsilon_P_bounded) that partitions uptake between P and N, which is not present in the TRUTH formulation. Overall most ecological roles are present but implemented as standard alternates rather than an exact match to the TRUTH equations.",
