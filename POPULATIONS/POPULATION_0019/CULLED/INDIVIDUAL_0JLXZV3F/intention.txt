MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Monod kinetics for nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth
- Holling Type II functional response for zooplankton grazing
- Linear mortality for both phytoplankton and zooplankton
- Nutrient recycling from dead organic matter

This is the baseline model that will serve as a foundation for future improvements.

IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:
While the current model only includes nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth, oceanic mixed layer systems typically exhibit co-limitation by BOTH nutrients and light availability. Light is a fundamental resource that:
1. Decreases exponentially with depth due to absorption and scattering
2. Varies with mixed layer depth (deeper mixing = lower average light)
3. Interacts with nutrient limitation to control primary production
4. Is essential for photosynthesis and cannot be substituted

CURRENT MODEL STATUS:
The model currently uses nutrient-only limitation, which is appropriate for:
- Datasets lacking light and mixed layer depth measurements
- Initial model development and parameter estimation
- Establishing baseline dynamics before adding complexity

POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPROVEMENT (when light data becomes available):
Add light limitation to phytoplankton growth using a multiplicative co-limitation framework:

1. Calculate depth-averaged light intensity in the mixed layer:
   I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-k_w * MLD)) / (k_w * MLD)
   
   Where:
   - I_0 = surface light intensity (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
   - k_w = light attenuation coefficient (m^-1)
   - MLD = mixed layer depth (m)

2. Apply Monod-type light limitation:
   f_light = I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)
   
   Where K_I is the half-saturation constant for light

3. Modify phytoplankton growth equation:
   uptake = r_P * f_nutrient * f_light * P
   
   Where f_nutrient = N / (K_N + N)

This would create multiplicative co-limitation where growth is constrained by whichever resource is most limiting.

PARAMETERS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR LIGHT LIMITATION:
- I_0: Surface light intensity (data input, varies seasonally)
- MLD: Mixed layer depth (data input, varies seasonally)
- k_w: Light attenuation coefficient (parameter to estimate, ~0.04-0.2 m^-1 for oceanic waters)
- K_I: Half-saturation constant for light limitation (parameter to estimate, ~20-50 μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR FUTURE LIGHT ADDITION:
Adding light limitation would be essential for realistic plankton dynamics because it would:
1. Capture seasonal bloom dynamics driven by stratification and light availability
2. Explain why deep winter mixing suppresses phytoplankton despite high nutrients
3. Represent the fundamental constraint of photosynthesis requiring light
4. Allow the model to respond to environmental forcing (mixed layer depth changes)
5. Be well-supported by decades of oceanographic research on phytoplankton ecology

CURRENT FOCUS:
For now, the model focuses on nutrient-grazing dynamics, which is appropriate given the available data. The nutrient-only formulation allows us to:
- Establish baseline parameter estimates
- Understand fundamental NPZ dynamics
- Assess model performance with current data
- Provide a solid foundation for future enhancements when additional environmental data becomes available
