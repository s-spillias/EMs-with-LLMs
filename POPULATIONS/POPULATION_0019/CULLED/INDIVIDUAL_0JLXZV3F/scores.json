  "qualitative_description": "The candidate implements a standard MM (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient uptake driving phytoplankton growth, Holling type-II grazing, and linear mortality for both P and Z. It differs from the TRUTH NPZ in key structural ways: (1) phytoplankton growth is scaled by an explicit phytoplankton assimilation efficiency (epsilon_P_bounded) which is not present in TRUTH, (2) recycling is implemented as a single fraction of mortality (gamma_bounded * (P_loss + Z_loss)) rather than the TRUTH's combination of grazing-related unassimilated return and separate zooplankton recycling terms, and (3) the candidate omits the environmental mixing/entrainment term present for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and mixing loss for phytoplankton in TRUTH. The candidate therefore matches several ecological roles but uses common alternates (MM uptake, Holling II grazing, linear mortality) and introduces an extra process (explicit phytoplankton assimilation efficiency). The model also contains implementation-level features (Euler integration, bounded efficiencies, observation likelihood and priors) that are modeling/estimation choices rather than new ecological processes.",
