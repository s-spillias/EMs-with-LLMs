  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model in several places. It uses a Monod/Michaelis-Menten uptake (r_P * N/(K_N+N) * P) and a Holling type-II grazing (g_max * P/(K_Z+P) * Z) with explicit assimilation efficiencies for both phytoplankton and zooplankton. Phytoplankton non-grazing mortality is represented as a linear loss (m_P * P) similar to TRUTH's linear terms, but the candidate lacks an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (no k*(N0 - N) or k*P analog). Recycling in the candidate comes only from mortality (gamma_bounded*(P_loss + Z_loss)), and the candidate includes an extra quadratic density-dependent zooplankton mortality (m_Z2 * Z^2) that is not present in TRUTH. Overall: canonical roles are present (uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) but specific functional forms differ (Holling-II vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing, Monod-only uptake vs TRUTH's combined N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) structure), and mixing is missing.",
