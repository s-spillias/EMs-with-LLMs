MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with Monod kinetics for nutrient uptake and Holling Type II functional response for grazing. The structure is ecologically sound but lacks a critical density-dependent feedback mechanism.

KEY LIMITATION IDENTIFIED:
The current model uses linear mortality for zooplankton (m_Z * Z), which assumes constant per-capita mortality regardless of population density. This is ecologically unrealistic because:

1. Higher zooplankton densities attract more predators from higher trophic levels (fish, jellyfish)
2. Disease transmission increases with population density
3. Intraspecific competition and cannibalism occur in crowded conditions
4. Metabolic stress increases at high densities

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
Adding QUADRATIC (DENSITY-DEPENDENT) MORTALITY for zooplankton to capture the non-linear increase in mortality at higher population densities.

MATHEMATICAL CHANGE:
Zooplankton mortality changes from:
  OLD: m_Z * Z
  NEW: m_Z * Z + m_Z2 * Z^2

Where:
- m_Z: linear (background) mortality rate (day^-1)
- m_Z2: quadratic mortality coefficient (m^3 g^-1 C day^-1)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. The quadratic term implicitly represents predation by higher trophic levels (which increases with prey density)
2. Prevents unrealistic zooplankton blooms that can occur with linear mortality alone
3. Creates more realistic predator-prey oscillations
4. Well-supported in plankton ecology literature (e.g., closure terms in ecosystem models)
5. Adds minimal complexity (one parameter) for significant ecological realism

EXPECTED IMPACT:
- More realistic boom-bust dynamics in zooplankton populations
- Better representation of top-down control
- Improved model fit during periods of high zooplankton abundance
- More stable long-term dynamics

PARAMETER ADDITION:
New parameter m_Z2 (quadratic zooplankton mortality coefficient):
- Initial value: 0.01 m^3 g^-1 C day^-1 (conservative estimate)
- Lower bound: 0.0 (allows model to revert to linear if data doesn't support it)
- Upper bound: 1.0 (prevents excessive mortality)
- Ecological interpretation: strength of density-dependent mortality processes
