  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing, linear mortalities, and recycling) but uses different functional forms from the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth is Monod (N/(K+N)) \u00d7 P with an explicit phytoplankton assimilation efficiency, grazing is Holling Type II, mortalities are linear, and recycling is implemented as a fraction of mortality rather than explicit recycling of unassimilated grazing. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/dilution terms present in TRUTH. Numerical/estimation machinery (Euler forward, observation error, soft priors) is present but is not an ecological process.",
