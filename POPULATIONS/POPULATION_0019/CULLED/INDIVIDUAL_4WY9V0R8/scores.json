  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, phytoplankton growth, grazing, zooplankton growth and mortality), but several terms are formulated differently from the TRUTH model. Uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) nutrient term multiplied by an explicit irradiance-based light limitation (I_avg/(k_I+I_avg)), whereas TRUTH uses a nutrient Monod times an a/(b + c*P) term (which functions like a P-dependent limitation). Grazing/growth use a Holling type-II form in the candidate versus a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) saturating form in TRUTH. The candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/dilution terms in the P and Z equations and replaces the TRUTH mixing term in N with a constant N_input source. Recycling in the candidate is linear proportional to mortality/excretion rates rather than derived directly from predation-loss terms as in TRUTH. Overall, most canonical components are present but often as literature alternates (Holling II, Monod, linear mortality) and the candidate introduces an explicit irradiance/light submodel and a constant nutrient input term not present in TRUTH.",
