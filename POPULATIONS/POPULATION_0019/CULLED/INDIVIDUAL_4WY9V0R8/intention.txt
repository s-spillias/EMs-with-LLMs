MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing NPZ model captures basic trophic interactions with Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake and Holling Type II grazing. However, it lacks a critical environmental driver for oceanic mixed layer dynamics: light limitation.

KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:
Phytoplankton growth in the oceanic mixed layer is co-limited by both nutrients AND light availability. The current model assumes constant maximum growth rate (r_P), which is unrealistic because:
1. Light intensity varies seasonally and with depth in the mixed layer
2. Phytoplankton self-shading occurs at high biomass concentrations
3. Light limitation can be as important as nutrient limitation in controlling primary production

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Light-Limited Phytoplankton Growth
Added a light limitation function to phytoplankton growth that accounts for:
- Surface light intensity (I_0): incident photosynthetically active radiation
- Light attenuation in water (k_w): background light attenuation coefficient
- Self-shading by phytoplankton (k_c): specific attenuation coefficient per unit phytoplankton biomass
- Light saturation parameter (k_I): half-saturation constant for light-limited growth

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
The light limitation factor uses a depth-integrated formulation appropriate for mixed layer models:
- Average light in mixed layer = I_0 * (1 - exp(-(k_w + k_c*P))) / (k_w + k_c*P)
- Light limitation factor = I_avg / (k_I + I_avg)

This creates ecologically realistic dynamics:
1. At low phytoplankton biomass: light is abundant, nutrient limitation dominates
2. At high phytoplankton biomass: self-shading reduces growth, preventing unrealistic blooms
3. Seasonal variation in I_0 can drive bloom dynamics

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
This improvement is essential for oceanic mixed layer models because:
- Captures the dual limitation (nutrients + light) that controls phytoplankton
- Represents self-shading feedback that stabilizes the system
- Allows for more realistic seasonal dynamics
- Maintains model parsimony while adding critical realism

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- log_I_0: Log of surface light intensity (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
- log_k_w: Log of background water attenuation coefficient (m^-1)
- log_k_c: Log of phytoplankton-specific attenuation coefficient (m^2 g C^-1)
- log_k_I: Log of half-saturation constant for light limitation (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)

These parameters have well-established ranges in oceanographic literature and add mechanistic realism without over-parameterization.
