MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Monod kinetics)
- Zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II functional response)
- Phytoplankton mortality (linear)
- Zooplankton mortality (linear + quadratic for implicit predation)
- Nutrient recycling from dead biomass

Parameter values appear ecologically reasonable:
- Growth rates (r_P=0.6, g_max=0.5 day^-1) are typical for marine systems
- Efficiencies after logit transform: phytoplankton ~69%, zooplankton ~40%, recycling ~50%
- Half-saturation constants (K_N=0.1, K_Z=0.2 g C m^-3) are in realistic ranges
- Quadratic mortality (m_Z2=0.1) provides density-dependent control

=== IDENTIFIED GAP ===

The model lacks LIGHT LIMITATION for phytoplankton growth. In oceanic mixed layers, phytoplankton are co-limited by both nutrients AND light. The current model only considers nutrient limitation, which oversimplifies the system because:

1. Light availability varies seasonally and with depth
2. Phytoplankton biomass creates self-shading (Beer-Lambert law)
3. Deep mixing events reduce average light exposure
4. Light-nutrient co-limitation explains bloom dynamics better than nutrients alone

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add light limitation with self-shading to phytoplankton growth using a multiplicative co-limitation framework:

Growth = r_P * f(Light) * f(Nutrients) * P

Where:
- f(Light) = I_avg / (I_avg + K_I)  [Monod-type light limitation]
- I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-k_bg * H - k_c * P * H)) / (k_bg * H + k_c * P * H)  [Average light in mixed layer with self-shading]
- f(Nutrients) = N / (K_N + N)  [existing nutrient limitation]

New parameters:
1. I_0: Surface light intensity (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1) - represents incoming solar radiation
2. K_I: Half-saturation constant for light (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1) - phytoplankton light requirement
3. k_bg: Background light attenuation coefficient (m^-1) - water clarity/turbidity
4. k_c: Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (m^2 (g C)^-1) - chlorophyll-specific attenuation
5. H: Mixed layer depth (m) - depth over which phytoplankton are mixed

=== ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION ===

This improvement is ecologically meaningful because:

1. **Realism**: Light is a fundamental resource for photosynthesis, as important as nutrients
2. **Self-regulation**: Self-shading creates negative feedback preventing unrealistic blooms
3. **Seasonal dynamics**: Captures light-driven seasonal patterns in phytoplankton
4. **Well-established**: Beer-Lambert light attenuation is standard in marine ecology
5. **Testable**: Light parameters can be measured or estimated from oceanographic data

The multiplicative co-limitation (Liebig's Law of the Minimum extended) is more realistic than additive limitation because phytoplankton need BOTH light AND nutrients simultaneously.

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

- Light intensity I_0 could be constant (annual average) or time-varying (seasonal)
- Starting with constant I_0 for simplicity, can be extended to seasonal forcing later
- Mixed layer depth H could be constant or time-varying; starting with constant
- Self-shading term (k_c * P * H) increases light attenuation as phytoplankton biomass increases
- Average light I_avg accounts for exponential decay through the mixed layer
