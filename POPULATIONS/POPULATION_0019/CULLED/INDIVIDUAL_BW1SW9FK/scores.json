  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the standard ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) but uses different mathematical choices for many of them. It introduces an explicit light module (Beer\u2013Lambert depth-averaged irradiance with self-shading and mixed-layer depth) and multiplicative co-limitation (light \u00d7 nutrient) for phytoplankton growth, and uses a Holling type-II grazing functional response. Recycling is implemented as a simple fraction of mortality (gamma_bounded * (P_loss + Z_loss)). The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients present in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N)) and does not include an explicit mixing/entrainment loss for phytoplankton; it also adds a quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Overall, many components match literature alternates (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling-II grazing, linear mortality) rather than the exact TRUTH algebra (which uses specific forms such as P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing and explicit mixing into N).",
