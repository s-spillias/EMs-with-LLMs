MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Monod kinetics for nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth
- Holling Type II functional response for zooplankton grazing
- Linear mortality terms for both phytoplankton and zooplankton
- Complete nutrient recycling from mortality and inefficient grazing

IDENTIFIED LIMITATION:
The current model uses linear mortality for zooplankton (m_Z * Z), which is ecologically unrealistic for marine systems. In real oceanic ecosystems, zooplankton mortality is strongly density-dependent due to:

1. Predation by higher trophic levels (fish, jellyfish) that increases with zooplankton density
2. Cannibalism and intraspecific competition at high densities
3. Disease transmission that scales with population density
4. Encounter rates with predators that increase quadratically with prey density

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Linear mortality can lead to unrealistic dynamics:
- Allows unbounded zooplankton growth when grazing exceeds linear mortality
- Fails to represent top-down control by higher trophic levels
- Produces less stable oscillations than observed in nature
- Doesn't capture the self-limiting nature of zooplankton populations

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
Replace linear zooplankton mortality with a density-dependent (quadratic) term:

OLD: zoo_mortality = m_Z * Z
NEW: zoo_mortality = m_Z * Z + m_Z2 * Z²

Where:
- m_Z: linear mortality rate (background mortality, day⁻¹)
- m_Z2: quadratic mortality rate (density-dependent predation, day⁻¹ (g C m⁻³)⁻¹)

ECOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION:
- Linear term (m_Z * Z): Represents density-independent mortality (disease, senescence, dilution)
- Quadratic term (m_Z2 * Z²): Represents density-dependent mortality (predation by higher trophic levels)

The quadratic term becomes increasingly important at higher zooplankton densities, providing a natural population regulation mechanism that is well-documented in marine ecology literature.

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. More realistic population dynamics with self-limiting zooplankton growth
2. Better representation of trophic cascade effects
3. More stable oscillatory behavior matching observed plankton cycles
4. Improved model fit to data showing zooplankton population regulation

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- m_Z2: Quadratic zooplankton mortality coefficient
  - Initial value: 0.1 day⁻¹ (g C m⁻³)⁻¹
  - Bounds: [0.001, 1.0] based on marine ecology literature
  - Represents predation pressure from higher trophic levels

This modification maintains model parsimony while adding essential ecological realism for oceanic plankton dynamics.
