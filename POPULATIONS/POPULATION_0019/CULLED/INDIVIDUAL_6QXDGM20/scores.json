  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth + mortalities \u2192 recycling) but uses simpler Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation and Holling-II grazing instead of the TRUTH model's combined nutrient+light limitation and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Type III-like) grazing. The candidate includes linear phytoplankton mortality matching TRUTH, but omits the explicit mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton. Zooplankton mortality is implemented as linear + quadratic (an extra density-dependent term) and all unassimilated grazing plus the full zooplankton mortality are returned to the nutrient pool (different partitioning than TRUTH).",
