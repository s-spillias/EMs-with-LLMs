NPZ Plankton Population Model

This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton ecosystem in the oceanic mixed layer, tracking three key components:

1. NUTRIENT (N): Dissolved inorganic nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) available for phytoplankton uptake
2. PHYTOPLANKTON (P): Primary producers that convert nutrients into biomass through photosynthesis
3. ZOOPLANKTON (Z): Herbivorous grazers that consume phytoplankton

ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

Nutrient Dynamics:
- Nutrients are depleted by phytoplankton uptake (following Michaelis-Menten kinetics)
- Nutrients are regenerated through zooplankton excretion and phytoplankton mortality
- External nutrient input represents mixing from deeper waters

Phytoplankton Dynamics:
- Growth is limited by nutrient availability (Michaelis-Menten uptake kinetics)
- Losses occur through natural mortality, zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II functional response), and sinking
- Growth efficiency reflects the conversion of nutrients to phytoplankton biomass

Zooplankton Dynamics:
- Growth depends on phytoplankton consumption (Holling Type II functional response)
- Assimilation efficiency determines how much consumed phytoplankton becomes zooplankton biomass
- Losses occur through natural mortality and higher predation

KEY FEEDBACK LOOPS:
- Phytoplankton growth depletes nutrients, limiting further growth
- Zooplankton grazing controls phytoplankton, releasing nutrients back to the system
- High phytoplankton supports zooplankton growth, which then suppresses phytoplankton
- This creates oscillatory dynamics characteristic of predator-prey systems

The model captures the classic boom-and-bust cycles observed in plankton communities, where nutrient pulses trigger phytoplankton blooms, followed by zooplankton population increases that graze down the phytoplankton, releasing nutrients for the next cycle.
