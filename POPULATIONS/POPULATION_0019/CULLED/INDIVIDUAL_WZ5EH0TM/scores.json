  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the basic three-compartment interactions (N uptake \u2192 P growth \u2192 Z grazing \u2192 Z growth and mortalities) but uses different mathematical forms than the TRUTH Python NPZ in several key places. Uptake/growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten style N-limited term multiplied by P (r_P * N * P/(k_N + N)), grazing is Holling Type II (g_max * P * Z/(k_P + P)), and recycling is represented as linear returns from mortality/excretion (recycle_P*m_P*P + recycle_Z*m_Z*Z). The candidate omits the TRUTH restorative mixing/dilution term k*(N0-N) and the TRUTH\u2019s P-dependent modifier on uptake (a/(b + c*P) and the P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form used for grazing/transfer). The candidate therefore matches several ecological roles but often as alternates listed in the literature (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling II grazing, linear mortalities). Key practical/modeling extras present are estimation/observation machinery (observation error, soft-constraints/penalties) and a constant external nutrient input rather than a state-restoring mixing term; it also uses forward Euler discretization for dynamics (numerical, not ecological).",
