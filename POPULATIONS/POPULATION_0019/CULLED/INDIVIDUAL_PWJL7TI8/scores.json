  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ flows (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 zooplankton grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth and mortality) but several mechanistic forms differ from the TRUTH model. Key differences: (1) phytoplankton growth is multiplicative Monod co-limited by explicitly calculated light and nutrients (an alternate formulation relative to TRUTH's nutrient/light structure); (2) grazing is Holling type II (candidate) vs. a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (TRUTH) functional response (alternate); (3) recycling in the candidate comes from mortality terms only (gamma * (P_loss+Z_loss)) whereas TRUTH recycles non-assimilated grazing and zooplankton losses and also includes an explicit mixing/dilution of nutrients; (4) the candidate adds explicit light physics (attenuation, mixed layer average) and a quadratic zooplankton mortality term that are not in TRUTH. Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and matches several literature alternatives, but it omits TRUTH's explicit nutrient mixing term and the TRUTH-form of recycling from grazing, and it includes extra processes (light self-shading, quadratic Z mortality, explicit phytoplankton assimilation/uptake efficiency).",
