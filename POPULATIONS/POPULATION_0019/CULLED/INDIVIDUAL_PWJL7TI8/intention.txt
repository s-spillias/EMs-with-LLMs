MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Monod kinetics for nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth
- Holling Type II functional response for zooplankton grazing
- Linear phytoplankton mortality
- Combined linear and quadratic zooplankton mortality (representing natural death and predation)
- Constant nutrient recycling from dead organic matter

PARAMETER VALUE ASSESSMENT:
Current parameter values appear reasonable for marine plankton systems:
- r_P = 0.6 day^-1: typical for marine phytoplankton
- g_max = 0.5 day^-1: reasonable for marine zooplankton
- Efficiency parameters (logit-transformed): epsilon_P→69%, epsilon_Z→40%, gamma→50%
- Mortality rates: m_P = m_Z = 0.05 day^-1 (low natural mortality)
- m_Z2 = 0.1: moderate density-dependent predation

CRITICAL MISSING PROCESS:
The model currently assumes UNLIMITED LIGHT for phytoplankton growth. This is ecologically unrealistic for oceanic mixed layer systems because:

1. Light is a fundamental requirement for photosynthesis
2. Light availability decreases with depth in the water column
3. Phytoplankton biomass creates self-shading (light attenuation)
4. In many oceanic regions, light and nutrients co-limit phytoplankton growth
5. Seasonal and latitudinal variations in light are major drivers of plankton dynamics

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: LIGHT LIMITATION WITH SELF-SHADING

Add light limitation to phytoplankton growth using:
- I_0: Surface light intensity (W m^-2 or μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
- k_w: Background light attenuation coefficient for water (m^-1)
- k_p: Specific light attenuation by phytoplankton (m^2 (g C)^-1)
- H: Mixed layer depth (m)
- K_I: Half-saturation light intensity for phytoplankton growth

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
1. Calculate average light in mixed layer accounting for self-shading:
   I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-(k_w + k_p*P)*H)) / ((k_w + k_p*P)*H)

2. Light limitation factor (saturating response):
   L = I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)

3. Modified phytoplankton growth (co-limitation):
   uptake = r_P * (N/(K_N + N)) * (I_avg/(K_I + I_avg)) * P
   
   This implements multiplicative co-limitation where both nutrient AND light must be available.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Self-shading creates negative feedback: high phytoplankton biomass reduces light penetration
- This can drive boom-bust dynamics and realistic bloom termination
- Light limitation is essential for capturing seasonal cycles in temperate/polar oceans
- Co-limitation better represents the multi-factorial nature of phytoplankton growth

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
- I_0: Surface light intensity (literature values: 100-400 W m^-2 or 200-2000 μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
- k_w: Water attenuation coefficient (typical: 0.04-0.2 m^-1 for clear ocean water)
- k_p: Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (typical: 0.01-0.1 m^2 (g C)^-1)
- H: Mixed layer depth (typical: 10-100 m, varies seasonally)
- K_I: Half-saturation light intensity (typical: 20-50 W m^-2 or 100-300 μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- More realistic phytoplankton bloom dynamics
- Self-limiting growth at high biomass
- Better representation of seasonal cycles
- Improved model fit if light limitation is important in the data
- Foundation for future environmental forcing (seasonal light variation)

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding a fundamental ecological process that's critical for oceanic mixed layer plankton dynamics.
