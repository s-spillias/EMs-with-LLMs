Model Assessment:
The current model provides a robust framework for simulating COTS-coral interactions, capturing the essential boom-bust dynamics described in the project context. It correctly implements logistic growth for corals, selective predation by COTS (Holling Type II), and critical COTS life-history traits like reproductive and survival Allee effects. These mechanisms allow the model to simulate population explosions and subsequent crashes.

Identified Weakness:
The primary weakness is the oversimplification of COTS reproduction. The current growth term is a function of food intake and population density only. It completely omits the strong influence of environmental conditions, such as sea surface temperature (SST), on COTS spawning and larval success. This is a significant gap, as favorable environmental windows are widely considered to be a key trigger for the massive recruitment events that initiate outbreaks.

Proposed Ecological Improvement:
To address this, I will introduce a temperature-dependent reproductive success term into the COTS growth equation. This term will model reproductive success as a Gaussian (bell-shaped) function of SST. This means reproduction will be highest at an optimal temperature (`T_opt_cots`) and will decrease as temperatures move away from this optimum, constrained by a thermal tolerance width (`T_sigma_cots`).

Justification for Change:
This change introduces a crucial and realistic environmental driver for COTS outbreaks using an already available data stream (SST). It enhances the model's predictive power by allowing it to capture the timing and magnitude of outbreaks more accurately, as recruitment will now be co-limited by food availability and thermal conditions. This provides a dynamic, internal mechanism for triggering outbreaks, moving beyond a sole reliance on external larval immigration data and better reflecting the complex ecological reality.
