This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their interactions with fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) coral communities. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS by incorporating resource limitation, selective predation, and environmental drivers (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval immigration). COTS population growth is regulated by coral availability (with saturating functional response), environmental conditions, and density-dependent feedbacks. Outbreaks are triggered by episodic increases in larval supply or favorable environmental conditions, and sustained by high coral cover, but collapse as coral is depleted or other limiting factors intensify. The model predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, as well as the resulting impacts on coral community structure, by simulating annual time steps and accounting for both direct and indirect ecological feedbacks.
