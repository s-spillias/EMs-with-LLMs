This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between adult COTS abundance and two coral functional groups: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. COTS predation on corals is selective and density-dependent, with resource limitation and environmental drivers (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval immigration) modulating outbreak dynamics. The model incorporates saturating and threshold effects in predation and recruitment, process-specific efficiencies, and feedbacks between COTS and coral cover. Environmental variables can modify key rates, and all transitions are smoothed to ensure numerical stability. The model is designed for robust likelihood-based inference using time series data, with careful attention to avoiding data leakage and ensuring all predictions are based only on past states.
