Assessment:
- The current model includes key processes: COTS predation on two coral types, logistic growth, SST and immigration effects, and a smooth outbreak threshold.
- However, the resource limitation on COTS growth is linear and may not capture the abrupt, threshold-like nature of real COTS outbreaks.
- Outbreaks in nature are often sudden, with COTS populations remaining low until coral cover crosses a critical threshold, after which rapid population growth occurs.

Improvement:
- Replace the linear coral effect on COTS growth with a nonlinear Hill function (sigmoidal response).
- This introduces a threshold and saturation in the effect of coral cover on COTS population growth, allowing for more abrupt and realistic outbreak dynamics.
- Add two parameters: the Hill coefficient (controls abruptness) and the half-saturation constant (threshold).
- This change is ecologically justified, as COTS require a minimum coral cover to sustain outbreaks, and their population growth accelerates rapidly once this threshold is crossed.

Implementation:
- Add parameters `hill_n` (Hill coefficient) and `hill_K` (half-saturation constant) to parameters.json.
- In model.cpp, replace the linear coral effect with the Hill function in the COTS growth equation.
