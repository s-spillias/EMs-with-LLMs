This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their selective predation on coral communities. The model tracks the annual dynamics of adult COTS abundance and two coral groups: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. COTS population growth is driven by density-dependent recruitment, resource (coral) availability, and environmental forcing (e.g., larval immigration, sea-surface temperature). Outbreaks are triggered by favorable environmental conditions and/or immigration pulses, and sustained by high coral cover, but collapse as coral resources are depleted. Coral groups experience differential predation pressure from COTS, with Acropora being more heavily targeted. The model incorporates saturating functional responses for predation and resource limitation, smooth thresholds for outbreak initiation, and feedbacks between COTS and coral cover. All ecological rates are modulated by environmental covariates and bounded within biologically meaningful ranges. The model is designed for robust prediction of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration, and for exploring the indirect effects of COTS on coral community structure.
