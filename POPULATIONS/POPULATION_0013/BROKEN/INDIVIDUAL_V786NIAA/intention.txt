Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS and coral cover, with predictions based on previous time step states. Without the residuals file, a quantitative fit assessment is not possible, but the structure is appropriate for time series data.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model captures COTS boom-bust cycles via logistic growth, resource limitation (coral availability), SST effects, and outbreak triggers. It includes selective predation on fast/slow coral and immigration pulses, aligning with the project's focus.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model currently assumes that COTS predation on coral is partitioned by coral type but does not account for potential non-linear (saturating) effects of coral cover on COTS population growth, especially at high coral densities. This could oversimplify the outbreak dynamics, as COTS recruitment and survival may saturate or even decline at very high coral cover due to behavioral or density-dependent effects.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the episodic nature and self-limiting dynamics of COTS outbreaks, I will introduce a saturating (Michaelis-Menten type) resource limitation on the effect of coral availability on COTS population growth. This replaces the current linear coral_effect term with a non-linear function: coral_effect = (fast_prev * e_fast + slow_prev * e_slow) / (K_half + fast_prev * e_fast + slow_prev * e_slow), where K_half is a new parameter representing the half-saturation constant for coral-driven COTS growth. This approach is ecologically justified as it reflects diminishing returns of increased coral cover on COTS recruitment/survival and can help prevent unrealistically large outbreaks.

Parameters:
A new parameter "log_K_half" will be added to parameters.json, with a clear ecological description.

Implementation:
- Add "log_K_half" to parameters.json.
- Update model.cpp to use the saturating coral_effect in COTS growth.
- Document the change in this file.

This change should improve the model's ability to reproduce realistic outbreak timing, magnitude, and decline phases.
