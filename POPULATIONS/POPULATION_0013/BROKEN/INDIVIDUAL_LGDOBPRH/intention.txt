This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their interactions with two coral groups: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. The model is designed to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS, including the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks, by incorporating multiple ecological mechanisms:

1. COTS population growth is regulated by resource limitation (coral cover), density-dependent feedbacks, and environmental drivers (e.g., sea surface temperature, larval immigration).
2. COTS predation differentially impacts fast- and slow-growing coral groups, with functional responses reflecting selective feeding and saturation effects.
3. Coral groups recover via intrinsic growth, but are suppressed by COTS predation and environmental stressors.
4. Outbreaks are triggered and sustained by a combination of favorable environmental conditions, high larval supply, and resource availability, while feedbacks (e.g., coral depletion, self-limitation) drive collapse phases.
5. All processes are implemented with smooth, numerically stable equations and biologically meaningful parameter bounds, suitable for robust prediction and inference.

The model is intended for use with time series data on COTS abundance, coral cover, and environmental variables, and is structured for parameter estimation and scenario forecasting.
