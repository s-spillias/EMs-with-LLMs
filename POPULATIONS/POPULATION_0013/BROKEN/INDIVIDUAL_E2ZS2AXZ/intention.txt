Assessment:
- The current model includes density dependence, resource limitation, environmental modifiers, and a smooth outbreak threshold.
- However, the resource limitation on COTS growth is linear, which may not capture the abrupt boom-bust cycles observed in COTS outbreaks.
- Empirical evidence suggests COTS population growth responds nonlinearly to coral cover, with rapid increases above a threshold and collapse when coral is depleted.

Improvement:
- Introduce a nonlinear (Hill-type) resource limitation on COTS growth by replacing the linear coral cover effect with a saturating Hill function.
- This will allow for sharper transitions in COTS growth as coral cover changes, better capturing the timing and magnitude of outbreaks and collapses.

Justification:
- A Hill-type response is ecologically justified, as COTS require a minimum coral cover for rapid growth, and growth saturates at high coral cover.
- This modification should improve the model's ability to reproduce the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations and their impact on coral communities.
