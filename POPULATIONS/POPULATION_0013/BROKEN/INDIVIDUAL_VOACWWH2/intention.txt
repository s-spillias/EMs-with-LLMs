This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) coral groups. COTS population dynamics are driven by resource-dependent growth, density-dependent mortality, and episodic larval immigration, with environmental factors (e.g., sea surface temperature) modulating key rates. Coral cover is reduced by COTS predation and recovers via group-specific growth, subject to resource limitation and environmental modification. The model incorporates saturating and threshold effects, process-specific efficiencies, and feedbacks between COTS and coral communities. All processes are formulated to ensure numerical stability and biological realism, enabling robust prediction of outbreak events and their ecological consequences.
