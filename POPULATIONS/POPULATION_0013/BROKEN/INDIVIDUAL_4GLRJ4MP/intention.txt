Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and predicts time series for each. Without the residuals file, I cannot quantitatively assess fit, but the structure allows for comparison of observed and predicted values.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model captures COTS boom-bust cycles via density-dependent recruitment, SST-modulated recruitment, and a smooth outbreak threshold. It includes selective predation on two coral types and feedbacks between COTS and coral cover. However, the outbreak dynamics may be oversimplified, as the only feedback on COTS recruitment is via density dependence and SST, with no explicit negative feedback from coral depletion.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: A key ecological process that may be missing is the limitation of COTS recruitment by coral availability. In reality, COTS larvae require coral for settlement and juveniles require coral for survival. If coral cover is low, COTS outbreaks are less likely to be sustained or triggered, even if other conditions are favorable.

Chosen Improvement:
I will introduce a saturating resource limitation on COTS recruitment based on total coral cover (fast + slow). This will be implemented as a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) function, so that COTS recruitment is reduced when coral cover is low, and saturates at high coral cover. This mechanism is ecologically justified because COTS larvae and juveniles depend on coral for survival, and outbreaks are less likely or shorter when coral is depleted. This feedback should help the model better capture the collapse phase of outbreaks and prevent unrealistic persistence of high COTS numbers when coral is scarce.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: log_K_coral_settle (log coral cover at half-max COTS recruitment).
- Modify the COTS recruitment term to multiply by [total_coral / (total_coral + K_coral_settle)].
- Document the change and justification in parameters.json.

This improvement adds only one parameter and a simple non-linear feedback, but is ecologically meaningful and should improve the timing and duration of outbreaks.
