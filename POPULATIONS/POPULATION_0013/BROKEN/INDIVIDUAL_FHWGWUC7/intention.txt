Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses a process-based approach with lognormal likelihoods for COTS abundance and coral cover, and includes environmental covariates (SST, larval immigration). However, without direct access to the residuals file, we infer from the model structure that it may struggle to capture the abruptness and magnitude of COTS outbreaks, especially the rapid population explosions and subsequent crashes.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model incorporates key processesâ€”density-dependent COTS growth, selective predation on coral types, environmental modifiers, and outbreak thresholds. However, the outbreak mechanism is implemented as a smooth logistic threshold on COTS recruitment, which may not fully capture the sharp, episodic nature of real-world outbreaks.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The current outbreak threshold is a smooth function, which may dampen the abruptness of transitions between low and high COTS abundance. Additionally, the model does not explicitly account for feedback from coral depletion on subsequent COTS recruitment, which is ecologically plausible: severe coral loss following an outbreak can suppress future COTS recruitment, reinforcing the bust phase.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the boom-bust dynamics and feedbacks, I will introduce a negative feedback mechanism where low total coral cover reduces COTS recruitment in subsequent years. This will be implemented as a saturating function (e.g., Michaelis-Menten or Hill-type) that reduces COTS population growth when coral cover is depleted, reflecting resource limitation and reinforcing the bust phase after outbreaks.

Ecological Justification:
COTS larvae and juveniles depend on sufficient coral cover for survival and recruitment. After an outbreak, coral depletion can suppress COTS recovery, prolonging the bust phase. Including this feedback will improve the model's ability to simulate the timing and duration of outbreaks, aligning with observed ecological patterns.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: "coral_feedback" (strength of coral feedback on COTS recruitment).
- Modify the COTS growth equation to include a saturating feedback term based on total coral cover.
- Document the new parameter in parameters.json with justification.
