Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and predicts time series based on previous states. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here, but the structure is appropriate for time series fitting.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model captures COTS boom-bust cycles via logistic growth, resource limitation (coral cover), SST effects, and immigration pulses. It includes selective predation on fast and slow coral types and outbreak triggers. However, the outbreak dynamics may be too tightly coupled to instantaneous coral cover, and the feedback from coral depletion to COTS collapse may be oversimplified.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model assumes linear predation efficiency and direct resource limitation, but does not account for possible non-linear (saturating) effects of coral cover on COTS recruitment or survival, nor does it include feedbacks such as coral recovery lag or density-dependent COTS mortality at high densities.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the episodic and sometimes abrupt nature of COTS outbreaks, I will introduce a saturating (Michaelis-Menten type) resource limitation on COTS recruitment/growth, replacing the current linear coral_effect. This reflects that COTS recruitment/survival increases with coral cover but saturates at high coral availability, consistent with ecological understanding of resource limitation and outbreak triggers. This non-linear response can better capture threshold-like outbreak behavior and more realistic boom-bust cycles.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: log_K_coral_effect (log half-saturation constant for coral effect on COTS growth).
- Replace the linear coral_effect with a Michaelis-Menten function: coral_effect = (fast_prev * e_fast + slow_prev * e_slow) / (K_coral_effect + fast_prev * e_fast + slow_prev * e_slow + eps).
- Justification: This saturating function allows for more abrupt transitions to outbreak conditions and prevents unrealistically high sensitivity to small changes in coral cover, improving the model's ability to reproduce observed outbreak timing and magnitude.

No current time step values of response variables are used in prediction calculations.
