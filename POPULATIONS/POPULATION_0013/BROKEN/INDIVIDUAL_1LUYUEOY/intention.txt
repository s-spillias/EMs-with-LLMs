Assessment:
- The current model captures the main boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks, with density-dependent growth, resource limitation by coral, selective predation, and environmental triggers (SST, immigration).
- However, coral-coral competition is oversimplified: both fast and slow corals only compete via total cover, but in reality, fast-growing Acropora can outcompete slow-growing corals via overgrowth and space pre-emption, especially after disturbance or COTS outbreaks.
- This competitive asymmetry is important for capturing post-outbreak recovery and shifts in coral community structure, which are key to the system's resilience and outbreak cycles.

Chosen improvement:
- Add an explicit asymmetric competition term: fast coral (Acropora) suppresses slow coral (Faviidae/Porites) more strongly than vice versa.
- Ecological justification: Fast corals can rapidly occupy space and shade/overgrow slow corals, especially after COTS-induced mortality.
- Implementation: Add a new parameter (alpha_comp) representing the effect of fast coral on slow coral. Modify the slow coral logistic growth so that slow coral's carrying capacity is reduced more by fast coral than by itself.
