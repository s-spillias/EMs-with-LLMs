Assessment:
- The current model captures key features of COTS outbreaks (boom-bust cycles, selective predation, environmental effects).
- However, the effect of coral cover on COTS growth is modeled as a linear resource limitation, which may oversimplify the true ecological relationship.
- Empirical and theoretical studies suggest COTS recruitment/growth saturates with increasing coral cover, due to larval settlement cues and food/habitat limitation.

Improvement:
- I propose replacing the linear coral cover effect on COTS growth with a saturating (Michaelis-Menten/Holling Type II) function:
    coral_effect = coral_total_prev / (coral_total_prev + gamma_coral)
- This introduces a new parameter, gamma_coral, representing the half-saturation coral cover for COTS growth.
- This change allows for more realistic outbreak dynamics, sharper transitions, and better fits to observed boom-bust cycles, with minimal added complexity.

Implementation:
- Add gamma_coral to parameters.json with ecological justification.
- Update model.cpp to use the saturating coral effect in the COTS growth equation.
