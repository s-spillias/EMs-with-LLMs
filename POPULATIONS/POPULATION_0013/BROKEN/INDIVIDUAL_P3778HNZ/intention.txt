Assessment:
- The current model captures density-dependent COTS growth, selective predation, and environmental effects, but the resource limitation on COTS growth is linear and may not capture abrupt busts after outbreaks.
- Outbreaks in nature often end rapidly when coral cover falls below a critical threshold, which is not well represented by a linear limitation.
- The model may underpredict the speed and magnitude of COTS population crashes following severe coral depletion.

Improvement:
- Introduce a nonlinear (sigmoidal/Hill-type) resource limitation on COTS recruitment/growth.
- This will allow COTS populations to crash more abruptly when coral cover drops below a critical threshold, better matching observed boom-bust cycles.
- Add parameter: log_coral_half_sat (log half-saturation coral cover for COTS recruitment limitation).
- Use a Hill coefficient (n=3) for steepness; this can be fixed for identifiability.

Ecological justification:
- COTS require sufficient coral cover for recruitment and survival; when coral is depleted, populations can collapse rapidly.
- A sigmoidal limitation better reflects this ecological feedback and improves outbreak bust dynamics.
