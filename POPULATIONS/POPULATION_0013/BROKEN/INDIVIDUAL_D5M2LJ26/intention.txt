Assessment:
- The current model captures COTS boom-bust cycles via density-dependent recruitment, SST effects, and outbreak thresholds, and includes selective predation on coral types.
- However, it lacks a direct feedback from coral cover to COTS recruitment, which is ecologically important: COTS larvae and juveniles require coral for survival, and outbreaks collapse when coral is depleted.
- This omission may cause the model to overpredict COTS persistence after coral decline, and not fully capture the collapse phase of outbreaks.

Improvement:
- Add a resource limitation feedback on COTS recruitment based on total coral cover (fast + slow coral).
- Implement this as a saturating function: multiply COTS recruitment by (coral_avail / (coral_avail + h_coral)), where h_coral is a new parameter (half-saturation constant).
- This feedback is ecologically justified and should improve the model's ability to capture the timing and magnitude of outbreak collapses.
