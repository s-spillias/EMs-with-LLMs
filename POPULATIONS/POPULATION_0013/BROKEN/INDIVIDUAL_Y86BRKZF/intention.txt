Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: Without the residuals file, a quantitative assessment is not possible, but the model structure suggests it should capture broad COTS and coral trends. However, the use of simple logistic growth and Holling Type II predation may not fully capture the sharp outbreak peaks and rapid collapses observed in COTS populations.
2. Project Context: The model includes key processes (logistic COTS growth, coral predation, SST effects, immigration, and resource thresholds), but the outbreak dynamics may be oversimplified. Outbreaks are often triggered by non-linear feedbacks, such as strong Allee effects or density-dependent recruitment, which are not explicitly modeled here.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The current model lacks an explicit Allee effect (positive density dependence at low COTS abundance), which is ecologically important for episodic outbreaks. Allee effects can delay population growth at low densities, then allow rapid increases once a threshold is crossed, matching observed boom-bust cycles.

Chosen Improvement:
Add an Allee effect to COTS recruitment by introducing a parameterized non-linear term in the recruitment function. This will allow the model to better capture the sudden onset of outbreaks and the persistence of low-density phases, in line with ecological theory and observed COTS dynamics.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter `log_A_cots` (log Allee threshold for COTS, ind/m^2) to parameters.json.
- Modify the COTS recruitment term in model.cpp to include a factor: (cots_pred(t-1) / (A_cots + cots_pred(t-1))). This saturating function suppresses recruitment at low COTS densities and approaches 1 at high densities.
- This change is justified ecologically, as COTS require a minimum density for successful reproduction and outbreak initiation, and it is supported by literature on Allee effects in marine invertebrates.
