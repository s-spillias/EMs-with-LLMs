This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents interactions between adult COTS, fast-growing Acropora corals, and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites corals. COTS predation reduces coral cover, with selectivity for fast-growing species. Resource limitation is modeled via saturating (Michaelis-Menten) and threshold effects, and environmental drivers (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval immigration) modulate COTS recruitment and survival. Feedbacks include coral depletion reducing COTS carrying capacity, and coral recovery following COTS decline. The model is designed for robust prediction of outbreak dynamics, using only lagged (previous time step) state variables to avoid data leakage, and is suitable for fitting to time series data with appropriate error structures.
