Assessment:
- The current model captures key features of COTS-coral dynamics, including density-dependent COTS growth, selective predation, environmental effects, and a smooth outbreak threshold.
- However, the resource limitation on COTS growth is linear in total coral cover, which may oversimplify the abrupt collapse of COTS populations after outbreaks.
- There is no explicit non-linear feedback from coral depletion to COTS population dynamics, which is important for reproducing the characteristic boom-bust cycles.

Ecological improvement:
- I introduce a non-linear, saturating resource limitation on COTS population growth using a Michaelis-Menten function: (coral_total_prev) / (K_res + coral_total_prev).
- This allows COTS growth to saturate at high coral cover but decline more sharply as coral is depleted, better capturing the abrupt end of outbreaks.
- The new parameter log_K_res (log half-saturation constant for coral resource limitation) is added to parameters.json.
- This change is ecologically justified, widely used in consumer-resource models, and adds minimal complexity.
