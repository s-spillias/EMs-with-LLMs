Assessment:
- The current model includes key processes for COTS outbreaks: logistic population growth, resource limitation via coral cover, SST effects, and larval immigration. It partitions coral into fast and slow types, with selective predation.
- However, the model may oversimplify COTS mortality by making it strictly linear in COTS density. In reality, high COTS densities are associated with increased mortality due to disease, cannibalism, and resource depletion, which help terminate outbreaks and produce the observed boom-bust cycles.
- The model does not currently include feedback from high COTS density to increased mortality, which is a key ecological process for outbreak regulation.

Chosen improvement:
- I am adding a density-dependent (quadratic) mortality term for COTS. This means COTS mortality will increase more than linearly at high densities, representing effects such as disease transmission and cannibalism that intensify during outbreaks.
- This is implemented by adding a new parameter, "log_gamma_cots", which controls the strength of quadratic mortality. The total COTS mortality becomes: m_cots * COTS + gamma_cots * COTS^2.
- This mechanism is well-supported in outbreak ecology literature and should help the model better capture the timing and collapse of COTS outbreaks.
