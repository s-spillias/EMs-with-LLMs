Assessment:
1. The current model structure is capable of capturing COTS boom-bust cycles and selective predation on coral, but lacks a direct feedback from coral depletion to COTS recruitment.
2. While SST and immigration modulate COTS recruitment, there is no explicit food limitation: COTS can continue to recruit even when coral is nearly gone, which is ecologically unrealistic.
3. This may lead to overestimation of outbreak persistence and magnitude, and underestimation of busts following coral depletion.

Improvement:
To better capture the feedbacks that drive COTS boom-bust cycles, I am adding a saturating food limitation term to COTS recruitment. This term reduces COTS recruitment when total coral cover (fast + slow) is low, reflecting that COTS larvae and juveniles require sufficient coral food to survive and recruit successfully. This mechanism is well-supported in the literature and is critical for realistic outbreak dynamics.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: log_h_food (log half-saturation coral cover for COTS recruitment food limitation).
- Multiply COTS recruitment by a food availability term: food_avail = (fast_pred + slow_pred) / (fast_pred + slow_pred + h_food)
- This ensures that COTS recruitment is limited when coral is depleted, improving the model's ability to simulate the collapse phase of outbreaks.
