Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: Without the residuals file, a quantitative assessment is not possible, but the model structure suggests it can capture general boom-bust COTS dynamics and coral decline/recovery. However, the use of simple logistic growth and linear predation terms may not fully capture the sharpness and duration of outbreak peaks.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model includes COTS-coral interactions, SST and immigration effects, and a smooth outbreak threshold. However, it may oversimplify resource limitation and feedbacks that drive outbreak collapse and coral recovery.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes:
   - The predation functional response is saturating but does not include explicit resource limitation or feedback from coral depletion on COTS recruitment.
   - There is no explicit negative feedback from coral cover to COTS recruitment, which is ecologically important: when coral is depleted, COTS larvae may have lower survival or adults may starve, hastening outbreak collapse.

Chosen Improvement:
Add a resource limitation feedback: Make COTS recruitment efficiency depend nonlinearly on total available coral cover (fast + slow). This introduces a biologically realistic mechanism where COTS outbreaks collapse more rapidly when coral is depleted, and helps prevent unrealistically prolonged outbreaks. This is implemented as a saturating function (Michaelis-Menten type) of total coral cover, multiplying the COTS recruitment term.

Justification:
- Ecological evidence shows COTS larvae and adults require sufficient coral for survival and recruitment; coral depletion leads to rapid COTS decline.
- This feedback is critical for reproducing the observed sharp "bust" phase of outbreaks and realistic outbreak duration.
- The added complexity is minimal (one parameter) but ecologically justified and improves model realism for the project context.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: log_K_coral_recruit (log coral cover at half-max COTS recruitment efficiency).
- Multiply the COTS recruitment term by: (total_coral) / (total_coral + K_coral_recruit), where total_coral = fast_pred + slow_pred at previous time step.
- Document and justify the new parameter in parameters.json.
- Update model.cpp accordingly.
