This model simulates episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their interactions with two functional groups of corals: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. The model predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions, accounting for resource limitation, selective predation, and environmental drivers (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval immigration). COTS population growth is regulated by density-dependent feedbacks, resource availability (coral cover), and environmental conditions, with saturating and threshold effects to capture nonlinearities. Coral groups are depleted by COTS predation (with group-specific selectivity and efficiency), but recover via intrinsic growth, subject to resource limitation and environmental modification. The model incorporates smooth transitions and penalties to ensure numerical stability and biologically meaningful parameter ranges. All predictions are made using only information from previous time steps, ensuring robust forecasting and avoiding data leakage.
