Assessment:
- The current model captures the main features of COTS boom-bust dynamics, including logistic growth, resource limitation, SST effects, and selective predation on coral types.
- However, it lacks an explicit Allee effect (positive density dependence) in COTS recruitment, which is ecologically important for accurately modeling outbreak triggers. Without this, the model may over-predict outbreaks from low background densities and fail to capture the critical threshold needed for population explosions.

Improvement:
- I added an Allee effect to the COTS recruitment term. This introduces a new parameter (log_allee_cots), representing the COTS density at which recruitment is half-maximal.
- The recruitment term is now multiplied by (cots_pred(t-1) / (cots_pred(t-1) + allee_cots)), which suppresses recruitment at low COTS densities and allows rapid growth only when the population exceeds the Allee threshold.
- This change is ecologically justified by the biology of COTS (broadcast spawning, fertilization success, aggregation) and is expected to improve the timing and magnitude of predicted outbreaks.
