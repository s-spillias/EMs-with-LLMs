Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast, and slow coral, and includes density dependence, predation, SST effects, and immigration. However, without residuals, direct assessment of fit is not possible here, but the structure is appropriate for capturing general trends.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model includes mechanisms for COTS outbreaks (density dependence, outbreak threshold, SST, immigration) and selective predation on coral types. It captures boom-bust cycles via recruitment, mortality, and predation feedbacks.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model assumes that COTS predation on coral is only limited by coral availability and COTS abundance, with a saturating functional response. However, it does not explicitly include resource limitation or competition between coral types, nor does it allow for non-linear feedbacks from coral depletion on COTS recruitment.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the collapse phase of COTS outbreaks and the feedback between coral depletion and COTS population crashes, I will introduce a direct feedback from total coral cover (fast + slow) to COTS recruitment. This represents the ecological reality that COTS larvae require sufficient coral for settlement and survival, and that severe coral depletion can suppress future COTS recruitment, hastening the bust phase. This is implemented as a saturating function (Michaelis-Menten type) of total coral cover modulating COTS recruitment.

Justification:
This feedback is ecologically justified because COTS larvae depend on coral for settlement and juvenile survival. Severe coral loss during outbreaks can reduce subsequent COTS recruitment, reinforcing the bust phase and producing more realistic boom-bust cycles. This mechanism is simple, biologically grounded, and avoids unnecessary complexity.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: log_coral_half_sat, representing the log of the half-saturation constant for coral cover in the feedback.
- In model.cpp, multiply COTS recruitment by (total_coral / (total_coral + coral_half_sat)), where total_coral = fast_pred(t-1) + slow_pred(t-1).
- Document the new parameter in parameters.json with ecological justification.
