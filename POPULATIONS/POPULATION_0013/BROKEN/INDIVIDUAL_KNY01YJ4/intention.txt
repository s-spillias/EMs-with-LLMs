Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS and coral cover, and includes process and observation error. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here. The structure is appropriate for time series data, but the fit should be checked for systematic bias, especially around outbreak peaks and busts.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model captures COTS boom-bust cycles via density-dependent growth, resource limitation (coral cover), environmental drivers (SST, immigration), and selective predation on coral types. Outbreaks are modeled with a smooth threshold. However, the model may oversimplify the feedback between coral depletion and COTS decline, especially during outbreak collapse phases.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model assumes that COTS predation on coral is a simple Holling Type II response, and that coral recovery is only limited by total cover. It does not explicitly account for the possibility that severe coral depletion (especially of fast-growing Acropora) could sharply reduce COTS recruitment or survival, creating a strong negative feedback that triggers rapid outbreak collapse.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the rapid decline of COTS populations following coral depletion (a key feature of outbreak busts), I will introduce a *resource-dependent COTS recruitment efficiency* term. This term will sharply reduce COTS recruitment when total coral cover (fast + slow) falls below a critical threshold, representing the ecological reality that COTS larvae and juveniles require sufficient live coral for settlement and survival. This feedback is supported by literature and will help the model produce more realistic, abrupt busts after outbreaks.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: "coral_cover_thresh" (critical coral cover threshold for COTS recruitment, as a proportion of K_coral).
- Modify the COTS growth equation so that the effective recruitment rate is multiplied by a saturating function of total coral cover (e.g., a logistic or Hill function), which drops rapidly as coral cover falls below the threshold.
- This mechanism is ecologically justified and mathematically simple, and should improve the timing and abruptness of outbreak collapses.
