Assessment of Current Model:
----------------------------
1. Model Fit:
   - Without the residuals file, direct quantitative assessment is not possible, but the model structure suggests it should capture general trends in COTS and coral cover.
   - The model uses lognormal likelihoods and process error, which are appropriate for ecological time series.

2. Addressing Project Context:
   - The model includes density-dependent COTS growth, resource limitation by coral, selective predation, environmental effects (SST, immigration), and outbreak thresholds.
   - It is designed to capture boom-bust cycles and selective predation on coral types.

3. Missing or Oversimplified Processes:
   - The model currently assumes that COTS predation on coral is a simple Holling Type II (saturating) functional response, with selectivity for coral types.
   - However, it does not include direct competition between coral types for space, which is ecologically important: as one coral group increases, it limits the available space for the other, affecting recovery and post-outbreak dynamics.
   - This may lead to overestimation of coral recovery rates and underestimation of competitive exclusion, especially after COTS outbreaks.

Ecological Improvement Chosen:
------------------------------
**Add explicit interspecific competition between fast and slow-growing coral groups for space.**
- Rationale: Space is a limiting resource on reefs. When one coral group occupies more space, it directly limits the other, especially after disturbance. This feedback is critical for realistic post-outbreak recovery and for capturing shifts in coral community composition.
- Mathematical Form: Add a competition coefficient (gamma_fast_slow) to the fast coral growth equation, and (gamma_slow_fast) to the slow coral equation, representing the negative effect of the other group on each group's growth.
- This is a simple, ecologically justified extension that adds realism without excessive complexity.

Implementation:
---------------
- Add two new parameters: gamma_fast_slow and gamma_slow_fast (competition coefficients).
- Modify the fast and slow coral growth equations to include these competition terms.
- Document parameter meaning and justification in parameters.json.
