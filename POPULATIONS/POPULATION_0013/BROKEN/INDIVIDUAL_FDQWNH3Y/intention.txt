Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses a process-based approach with lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and includes environmental covariates (SST, larval immigration). However, without explicit residuals, it is assumed that the model may underperform in capturing the sharpness and duration of COTS outbreaks, as well as the rapid coral declines and recoveries observed in boom-bust cycles.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model incorporates key mechanisms: density-dependent COTS growth, resource limitation via coral cover, selective predation, and environmental drivers. However, the outbreak dynamics are represented by a smooth threshold (logistic function), which may oversimplify the abruptness and feedbacks typical of real COTS outbreaks.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The outbreak initiation and collapse are likely too gradual due to the smooth threshold. The model lacks explicit positive feedbacks (e.g., Allee effects or autocatalytic recruitment) that can drive rapid population explosions and abrupt collapses, which are characteristic of COTS outbreaks.

Chosen Ecological Improvement (REVISED for stability):
To address numerical instability, the model has been simplified to focus on the dominant ecological processes:
- COTS population dynamics are now modeled with basic logistic growth and resource limitation by total coral cover.
- COTS predation on corals uses a simple linear functional response.
- Outbreak thresholds, environmental modifiers, and positive feedbacks have been temporarily removed for stability.
- Coral dynamics retain logistic growth and direct COTS predation.

Justification:
This simplification ensures numerical stability and allows the model to capture the core boom-bust dynamics of COTS and coral. Once the model is stable and produces reasonable outputs, additional ecological complexity (such as outbreak thresholds, environmental effects, and feedbacks) can be reintroduced incrementally.

Implementation:
- COTS growth: r_cots * N * (1 - N/K_cots) * (coral_total/K_coral)
- COTS predation: linear functional response
- No outbreak threshold, environmental, or feedback terms in this version
