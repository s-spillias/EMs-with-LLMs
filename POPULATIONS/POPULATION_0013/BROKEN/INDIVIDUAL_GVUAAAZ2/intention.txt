Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and includes a range of ecological processes (density-dependent recruitment, SST effects, immigration, predation, logistic coral growth, and outbreak threshold). However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible. The structure suggests reasonable fit to boom-bust cycles, but the outbreak onset and decline may be too abrupt or not sustained long enough.
2. Project Context: The model addresses the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks, selective predation, and coral community impacts. It includes environmental (SST) and immigration effects, and a smooth outbreak threshold. However, the outbreak dynamics may be oversimplified, as the outbreak threshold is a simple sigmoid function of COTS density.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: A key ecological process that may be missing is a time-lagged feedback or "resource depletion" effect: after a COTS outbreak, coral cover is reduced, which should suppress subsequent COTS recruitment and prolong the bust phase. The current model includes coral availability in predation, but COTS recruitment is not directly limited by coral depletion.

Chosen Improvement:
- **Resource Limitation Mechanism on COTS Recruitment**: Introduce a saturating function that reduces COTS recruitment when total coral cover (fast + slow) is low. This reflects that COTS larvae and juveniles require sufficient coral for settlement and survival, and that outbreaks cannot be sustained if coral is depleted. This mechanism is ecologically justified and should improve the model's ability to capture the duration and suppression of outbreaks following coral loss.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter `logit_coral_recruit_lim` to parameters.json, controlling the steepness and midpoint of the coral limitation effect.
- In model.cpp, multiply COTS recruitment by a saturating function of total coral cover: e.g., `coral_recruit_lim = 1/(1+exp(-logit_coral_recruit_lim * (total_coral/K_coral_lim - 1)))`, where `total_coral = fast_pred(t-1) + slow_pred(t-1)` and `K_coral_lim` is the sum of carrying capacities.
- This will suppress COTS recruitment when coral is depleted, better matching observed boom-bust cycles and the ecological reality of resource limitation.
