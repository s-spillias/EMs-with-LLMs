Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and includes mechanisms for COTS recruitment, predation, coral growth, and mortality. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here. In typical applications, residuals often show that the model can capture general boom-bust cycles but may miss the precise timing, magnitude, or abruptness of outbreak peaks and declines.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model includes density-dependent COTS recruitment, SST effects, immigration, and a smooth outbreak threshold. It models selective predation on coral types and logistic coral growth. However, the outbreak dynamics may be oversimplified, as the only feedback on COTS recruitment is via density dependence and a smooth threshold.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: A key ecological process that may be missing is resource limitation via coral depletion. In reality, COTS outbreaks can crash rapidly when coral prey is depleted, creating a strong feedback that abruptly ends outbreaks. The current model includes predation but does not directly limit COTS recruitment or survival based on coral availability.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the abrupt decline phase of COTS outbreaks and the feedback between prey depletion and predator population collapse, I will introduce a saturating resource limitation on COTS recruitment. Specifically, I will multiply COTS recruitment by a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) function of total available coral cover. This ensures that when coral is depleted, COTS recruitment is strongly reduced, producing more realistic boom-bust cycles and abrupt outbreak collapses.

Mathematical Form:
Modify COTS recruitment as follows:
- Multiply the recruitment term by: (coral_avail) / (coral_avail + coral_half_sat)
- Add a new parameter: log_coral_half_sat (log half-saturation constant for coral effect on COTS recruitment)

Ecological Justification:
This term represents the requirement for sufficient coral prey for successful COTS larval settlement and recruitment. When coral cover is low, recruitment is strongly limited, reflecting field observations that COTS populations cannot sustain outbreaks without abundant coral prey.

Implementation:
- Add parameter log_coral_half_sat to parameters.json with justification.
- Update model.cpp to include the saturating coral limitation in COTS recruitment.
