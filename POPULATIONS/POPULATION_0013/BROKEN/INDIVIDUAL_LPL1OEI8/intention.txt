Assessment:
1. The current model structure is capable of capturing the general boom-bust cycles of COTS and their impact on coral, with density dependence, SST effects, and immigration. However, it assumes a fixed efficiency of coral-to-COTS conversion, which may not reflect ecological reality at high COTS densities.
2. To better address the project context—specifically, the triggers and sustainability of outbreaks and their eventual collapse—I propose introducing a variable efficiency term for coral-to-COTS conversion that decreases with increasing COTS density. This reflects ecological processes such as interference or intraspecific competition, which can reduce conversion efficiency during outbreaks.
3. This improvement should help the model more realistically capture the magnitude and duration of COTS outbreaks and the subsequent bust phase.

Change:
- Add a parameter (`log_effic_pred_slope`) controlling the density-dependence of coral-to-COTS conversion efficiency.
- Modify the predation gain term in the model so that efficiency declines as COTS density increases, preventing unrealistically high COTS peaks and better matching observed outbreak dynamics.
