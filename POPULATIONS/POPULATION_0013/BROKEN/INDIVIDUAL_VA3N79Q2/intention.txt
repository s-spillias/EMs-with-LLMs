Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS and coral cover, and includes density dependence, SST effects, and immigration. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here. The structure is reasonable for capturing general trends, but may not fully capture the sharpness and duration of outbreak peaks.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model includes mechanisms for COTS outbreaks (density dependence, outbreak threshold, SST/immigration effects) and selective predation on coral types. However, the outbreak dynamics may be oversimplified, as the only feedback on COTS recruitment is via a smooth outbreak threshold and SST.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: A key ecological process that may be missing is *resource limitation via coral depletion*. In reality, COTS outbreaks can crash rapidly when coral prey is depleted, leading to sharp busts. The current model allows COTS to persist even when coral is low, as COTS recruitment and survival are not directly limited by coral availability.

Chosen Improvement:
**Resource Limitation Mechanism:** Introduce a saturating functional response for COTS recruitment and/or survival based on total available coral cover. This means COTS population growth will be directly limited when coral cover is low, better capturing the rapid decline phase of outbreaks and the feedback between prey and predator.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter `logit_coral_lim` representing the sensitivity of COTS recruitment to coral availability (on a logit scale, transformed to 0-1).
- Modify the COTS recruitment term so that it is multiplied by a saturating function of total coral cover (e.g., coral_avail / (coral_avail + coral_lim)), where coral_lim is a tunable parameter.
- This will allow the model to better capture the boom-bust cycles by enforcing that COTS cannot sustain high recruitment when coral is depleted.

Ecological Justification:
- Outbreaks are often terminated by prey depletion, and COTS larvae require sufficient coral for settlement and juvenile survival.
- This feedback is well-supported in the literature and is critical for realistic outbreak dynamics.

No current time step data is used in prediction calculations; only lagged (t-1) values are used, in accordance with best practices.
