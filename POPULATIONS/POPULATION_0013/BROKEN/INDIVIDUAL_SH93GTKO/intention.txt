Assessment:
- The current model captures key processes for COTS outbreaks: logistic growth, resource limitation via coral cover thresholds, SST effects, immigration, and predation using Holling Type II response.
- However, the resource limitation on COTS recruitment is implemented as a smooth threshold (sigmoid), which may not fully capture the saturating effect of coral availability on COTS recruitment. This could lead to over- or under-estimation of outbreak magnitude and timing, especially when coral cover is high.
- Other processes (feedbacks, variable efficiency, higher-order predation) are not explicitly modeled, but the most ecologically meaningful and justifiable improvement is to refine the resource limitation mechanism.

Chosen Improvement:
- Replace the smooth threshold for coral cover in the COTS recruitment term with a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) function of total coral cover (fast + slow).
- This reflects that COTS recruitment increases with coral cover but saturates at high coral densities, consistent with ecological understanding of larval settlement and juvenile survival.
- Add a new parameter: log_K_resource (log half-saturation constant for coral resource limitation).

Justification:
- This change introduces a more realistic, non-linear resource limitation, improving the model's ability to predict the onset, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
- The added complexity is minimal (one parameter), but the ecological realism is substantially improved.

Implementation:
- Add log_K_resource to parameters.json with justification.
- In model.cpp, replace the smooth threshold in the COTS recruitment term with a Michaelis-Menten function of (fast_pred + slow_pred).
- Use only lagged (t-1) values for prediction, as per instructions.
