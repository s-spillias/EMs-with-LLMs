This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents three key ecosystem components: adult COTS abundance, fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp.), and slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites spp.). COTS predation differentially impacts coral groups, with fast-growing corals being more susceptible. The model incorporates resource limitation via saturating functional responses, environmental modification of rates (e.g., temperature effects), and feedbacks such as coral depletion reducing COTS recruitment. Outbreaks are triggered and sustained by a combination of larval immigration, favorable environmental conditions, and coral availability, while collapse is driven by resource depletion and density-dependent mortality. All ecological processes are formulated to ensure numerical stability and biological realism, supporting robust prediction of future ecosystem states.
