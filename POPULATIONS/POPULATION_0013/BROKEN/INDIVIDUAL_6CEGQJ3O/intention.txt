Assessment:
- The current model captures key COTS-coral dynamics (logistic growth, predation partitioned by coral type, outbreak triggers via coral cover, SST, and immigration).
- However, the resource limitation on COTS growth is linear, which may not realistically capture the abruptness and duration of outbreaks observed in nature.
- Ecological studies suggest COTS population growth should saturate at high coral cover due to limits in feeding/assimilation, reflecting handling time or satiation.

Improvement:
- I am introducing a saturating (Michaelis-Menten type) resource limitation for COTS population growth.
- This replaces the linear coral_effect with a function that saturates as coral cover increases, controlled by a new parameter Km_coral.
- This change is ecologically justified as it allows for sharper, more realistic outbreak peaks and collapses, better matching observed boom-bust cycles and the limits of COTS population response to abundant coral.

Implementation:
- Added parameter log_Km_coral (log half-saturation constant for resource effect).
- Modified model.cpp to use Michaelis-Menten resource limitation in COTS growth.
