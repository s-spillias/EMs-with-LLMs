Assessment:
- The current model captures key processes for COTS outbreaks, including logistic growth, resource limitation, selective predation, environmental (SST) effects, and outbreak triggers.
- However, it assumes fixed attack rates on fast and slow coral, not accounting for adaptive foraging (prey switching) by COTS.
- Ecological studies suggest COTS preferentially consume the most abundant coral type, a non-linear response that can stabilize or destabilize coral communities and affect outbreak dynamics.
- This omission may lead to systematic residuals, especially if the model over- or under-predicts COTS impact on coral types during outbreaks.

Improvement:
- Introduce a prey switching (adaptive foraging) mechanism by making the attack rate on each coral type a function of its relative abundance, using a sigmoid function controlled by a new parameter `s_switch`.
- This allows the model to capture non-linear predation responses and better reflect observed boom-bust cycles and coral resilience.
- The new parameter `s_switch` (prey switching exponent) will be added to parameters.json and implemented in model.cpp.
