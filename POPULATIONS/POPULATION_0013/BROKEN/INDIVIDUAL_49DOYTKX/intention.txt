Assessment:
- The current model captures the general boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their selective predation on coral types.
- However, it lacks a strong, non-linear feedback mechanism that triggers rapid COTS population collapse when coral cover is severely depleted.
- This is a key ecological process in real-world COTS outbreaks, where populations crash rapidly due to starvation when food (coral) becomes limiting.

Chosen improvement:
- Introduce a non-linear, saturating resource limitation on COTS survival/growth, such that COTS mortality increases sharply when total coral cover drops below a critical threshold.
- This is implemented by adding a new parameter (logit_coral_starve_thresh) representing the coral cover threshold for starvation, and modifying the COTS mortality term to include a steep, non-linear increase when coral is scarce.

Ecological justification:
- COTS populations are known to collapse rapidly when coral food is depleted, driving the bust phase of outbreaks.
- Explicitly modeling this starvation feedback will improve the model's ability to capture the timing and magnitude of outbreak collapses, as required by the project context.
