Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and includes detailed process equations for COTS population dynamics and coral cover. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here. The structure suggests reasonable mechanistic realism, but the model may underperform in capturing the abruptness and duration of COTS outbreaks, especially if feedbacks are too weak or resource limitation is oversimplified.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model includes COTS predation on two coral types, logistic growth, SST effects, and an outbreak threshold. It attempts to capture boom-bust cycles, but the outbreak mechanism is a smooth function of coral cover and may not generate sharp, episodic outbreaks as observed in nature.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The current outbreak trigger is a linear function of coral cover (resource effect), modulated by a smooth threshold. However, empirical evidence suggests that COTS outbreaks are highly non-linear and may require a stronger, saturating (non-linear) response to resource availability, such as a Hill function or higher-order polynomial, to generate realistic, abrupt outbreaks.

Chosen Improvement:
I will implement a non-linear (Hill-type) resource limitation function for the outbreak trigger, replacing the current linear coral_effect in the outbreak_boost calculation. This will allow for sharper, threshold-like responses of COTS population growth to coral availability, better capturing the episodic nature of outbreaks. This approach is ecologically justified because COTS outbreaks are known to occur only when coral cover exceeds a critical threshold, and the response is highly non-linear.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: "hill_n" (Hill coefficient, controls steepness of outbreak response).
- Replace the linear coral_effect in the outbreak_boost with a Hill function: coral_effect^hill_n / (coral_effect^hill_n + phi_outbreak^hill_n)
- Document the new parameter in parameters.json with ecological justification.

This change increases realism with minimal added complexity and directly addresses the need to model abrupt, episodic outbreaks as described in the project context.
