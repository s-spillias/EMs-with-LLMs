This model simulates episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model dynamically links COTS population dynamics with their selective predation on two coral functional groups: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. COTS population growth is regulated by resource limitation (coral cover), environmental drivers (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval immigration), and feedbacks from coral depletion. Coral groups are depleted by COTS predation and recover via group-specific growth rates, with resource limitation and environmental modification of rates. The model uses saturating and threshold functions to capture nonlinearities, and smooth penalties to ensure parameters remain within biologically meaningful ranges. All predictions are made using only lagged (previous time step) values of state variables to avoid data leakage, and the likelihood is calculated for all observations using robust error models. The model is designed for use with Template Model Builder (TMB) for efficient parameter estimation and forecasting.
