Assessment:
The current model captures key features of COTS outbreaks, including density dependence, selective predation, environmental drivers, and a smooth outbreak threshold. However, the resource limitation on COTS recruitment is linear, which may not adequately represent the abrupt collapse of outbreaks observed when coral cover falls below a critical threshold. This could lead to overestimation of outbreak duration and underestimation of the sharpness of boom-bust cycles.

Improvement:
To address this, I introduce a nonlinear (Hill-type) resource limitation on COTS recruitment. This saturating function sharply reduces COTS recruitment when coral cover drops below a critical value, providing a strong negative feedback that can abruptly end outbreaks. This mechanism is ecologically justified, as COTS larvae and juveniles require sufficient coral for survival, and outbreaks often collapse rapidly when food is exhausted.

Implementation:
- Add parameters: 'hill_n_cots' (Hill coefficient, controls steepness) and 'coral_crit_cots' (critical coral cover for COTS recruitment).
- Replace the linear coral limitation in COTS growth with a Hill function.
- Update parameter file and model code accordingly.

This change should improve the model's ability to reproduce the timing and abruptness of outbreak collapses, better matching observed boom-bust dynamics.
