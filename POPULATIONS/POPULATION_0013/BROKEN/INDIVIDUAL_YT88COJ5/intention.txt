Assessment:
- The current model captures the main boom-bust dynamics of COTS and their predation on coral, with environmental (SST) effects and resource thresholds.
- However, it assumes constant assimilation efficiency for COTS, which is ecologically unrealistic at high densities. This may limit the model's ability to capture the bust phase and self-limitation of outbreaks.

Improvement:
- I added density-dependent assimilation efficiency for COTS (e_fast and e_slow now decline as COTS density increases).
- This introduces a negative feedback that is ecologically justified (competition, stress, resource depletion at high COTS densities) and is supported by outbreak ecology literature.
- The change adds only one parameter (log_delta_e) and a simple nonlinearity, but should improve the model's ability to capture the timing and magnitude of outbreak collapses, directly addressing the project context.

Implementation:
- Added parameter log_delta_e to parameters.json.
- In model.cpp, e_fast and e_slow are now divided by (1 + delta_e * cots_pred(t-1)) at each time step.
- All calculations use only lagged (t-1) values, avoiding data leakage.
