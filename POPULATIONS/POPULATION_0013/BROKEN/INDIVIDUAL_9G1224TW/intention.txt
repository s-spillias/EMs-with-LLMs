Assessment:
- The current model captures direct interactions between COTS and coral, with logistic growth, Holling Type II predation, and environmental forcing.
- However, the smooth sigmoid threshold for coral cover in COTS recruitment may not be sharp enough to trigger realistic, episodic outbreaks and rapid collapses, as observed in nature.
- Key ecological process missing: sharply nonlinear resource limitation on COTS recruitment, which is critical for generating boom-bust outbreak dynamics.

Chosen improvement:
- Replace the smooth sigmoid threshold for coral cover in COTS recruitment with a Hill function (generalized sigmoid), introducing a new parameter (hill_n) controlling the steepness of the threshold.
- This allows for a much sharper transition in COTS recruitment as coral cover crosses the threshold, better capturing the episodic nature of outbreaks and collapses.
- Ecological justification: Empirical evidence and outbreak theory suggest that COTS recruitment is highly sensitive to coral availability, with outbreaks triggered only when coral exceeds a critical threshold, and rapid collapse when coral is depleted.

Implementation:
- Add parameter "hill_n" to parameters.json (with ecological justification).
- In model.cpp, replace the smooth step for fast_thresh and slow_thresh with a Hill function using hill_n as the exponent.
- Document the change in intention.txt.
