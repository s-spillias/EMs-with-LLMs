Assessment of Current Model:

1. Model Fit:
Without the actual residuals file, a full quantitative assessment is not possible, but the model structure suggests it should capture the general trends in COTS and coral dynamics. However, the use of simple Holling Type II functional responses and linear resource effects may not fully capture the sharp, episodic nature of COTS outbreaks, especially the rapid population explosions and subsequent crashes.

2. Addressing Project Context:
The model includes key processes: COTS predation on two coral types, logistic growth for both COTS and corals, SST and immigration effects, and an outbreak threshold. However, the outbreak mechanism is a smooth function of coral cover and immigration, which may not be sufficient to generate the highly non-linear, episodic boom-bust cycles observed in real COTS populations.

3. Missing or Oversimplified Processes:
- The current model uses a linear resource effect for COTS growth, which may not adequately represent the threshold-like response of COTS outbreaks to coral availability.
- Feedbacks between coral depletion and COTS collapse are present but may be too gradual.
- No explicit density-dependent feedback on COTS predation efficiency or outbreak collapse.

Chosen Improvement: 
**Introduce a saturating (sigmoidal) resource limitation on COTS population growth using a Hill function for the coral effect.**

Ecological Justification:
A Hill function (with exponent >1) allows for a sharper, threshold-like response of COTS population growth to coral availability, better capturing the sudden onset of outbreaks when coral cover exceeds a critical level. This non-linear resource limitation is ecologically justified by the observation that COTS outbreaks are rare until coral cover is sufficiently high, after which population growth accelerates rapidly. This approach is more flexible than the current linear effect and can be tuned to match observed outbreak dynamics.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: `hill_n_coral` (Hill exponent for coral effect on COTS growth).
- Replace the linear coral effect in the COTS growth equation with a Hill function:  
  coral_effect = (resource / (resource + K))^n
- This will allow the model to generate sharper transitions into outbreak phases, improving fit to observed boom-bust cycles.
