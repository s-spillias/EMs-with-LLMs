Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast, and slow coral, and fits time series of abundance/cover. Without residuals, direct fit assessment is limited, but the structure is appropriate for positive-valued ecological data.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model captures COTS boom-bust cycles via density-dependent recruitment, SST effects, and a smooth outbreak threshold. It includes selective predation on coral types and feedbacks between COTS and coral.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model assumes COTS recruitment is only density-dependent and modulated by SST and outbreak threshold. However, it does not explicitly account for resource limitation on COTS recruitment due to coral availability, which is ecologically important during outbreaks when prey depletion can limit further COTS population growth.

Chosen Improvement:
- Add a saturating resource limitation term to COTS recruitment, reflecting that COTS larval recruitment is limited by available coral prey (especially during/after outbreaks when coral is depleted). This introduces a non-linear feedback: as coral cover declines, COTS recruitment is reduced, helping to capture the bust phase and outbreak duration more realistically.

Justification:
- Ecological studies show that COTS larvae require sufficient coral prey for successful settlement and survival. Outbreaks often collapse when coral is depleted. Adding a resource limitation term (e.g., Michaelis-Menten or saturating function of coral availability) to COTS recruitment will better capture the timing and magnitude of outbreak collapses, and is supported by empirical evidence.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter "log_K_coral_cots" (log coral cover at half-max COTS recruitment).
- Modify the COTS recruitment equation to include a saturating function of total coral availability: 
    recruit = r_cots * cots_pred(t-1) * (1 - cots_pred(t-1)/K_cots) * sst_effect * outbreak_mod * (coral_avail / (coral_avail + K_coral_cots)) + immig;
- This ensures that when coral is abundant, recruitment is near-maximal, but as coral is depleted, recruitment drops, capturing resource limitation and feedback.
