Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: Without the residuals file, a quantitative assessment is not possible, but the model structure suggests it should capture general trends in COTS and coral cover. However, the use of simple logistic growth and linear resource effects may limit its ability to reproduce sharp outbreak peaks and rapid collapses.
2. Project Context: The model includes key processes (COTS predation, coral growth, SST effects, larval immigration, outbreak threshold), but the outbreak dynamics may be oversimplified. The outbreak boost is a linear function of coral cover, which may not capture the abrupt, non-linear transitions observed in real COTS outbreaks.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The resource effect on COTS growth is linear, which may not reflect the threshold-like or saturating response of COTS to coral availability. In reality, COTS outbreaks often occur only when coral cover exceeds a critical threshold, and further increases in coral may not proportionally increase COTS growth.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the boom-bust outbreak dynamics, I will replace the linear coral resource effect in COTS growth with a saturating (Hill-type) function. This introduces a non-linear, threshold-like response of COTS population growth to coral availability, allowing for sharper outbreak onsets and collapses, as observed in the field. This is ecologically justified because COTS require a minimum coral cover to sustain rapid population growth, and their response to coral is not strictly linear.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter, "hill_n_coral", controlling the steepness of the resource response (Hill coefficient).
- Replace the linear coral_effect in model.cpp with a Hill function: coral_effect = pow(resource, n) / (pow(resource, n) + pow(hill_half, n)), where resource is the normalized coral availability and hill_half is the half-saturation constant (set to 0.5 for now).
- This change should allow the model to more realistically simulate abrupt COTS outbreaks and collapses, improving fit to observed boom-bust cycles.
