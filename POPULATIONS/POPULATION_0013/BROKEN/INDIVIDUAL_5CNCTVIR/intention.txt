Assessment:
- The current model captures COTS boom-bust cycles and selective predation, with environmental and outbreak threshold effects.
- However, the decline ("bust") phase of COTS outbreaks may be oversimplified: COTS mortality is constant, and there is no explicit feedback from coral depletion on COTS survival.
- In reality, severe coral loss (especially of fast-growing Acropora) can trigger starvation-driven COTS mortality, accelerating population crashes.

Improvement:
- I will add a resource-dependent COTS mortality term: as total coral cover declines, COTS mortality increases.
- This negative feedback is ecologically justified and should improve the model's ability to capture the timing and magnitude of outbreak collapses.
- The new parameter `gamma_m_cots` controls the strength of this effect.

Implementation:
- Add `gamma_m_cots` to parameters.json with justification.
- In model.cpp, COTS mortality becomes: m_cots_eff = m_cots + gamma_m_cots * (1 - coral_total_prev / K_coral)
- This term is used in the COTS population update, using only previous time step values.
