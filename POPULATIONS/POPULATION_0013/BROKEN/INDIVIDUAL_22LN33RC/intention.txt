Assessment:
The current model captures many key features of COTS outbreaks, including logistic growth, selective predation, resource limitation, and environmental triggers (SST, larval immigration). However, the predation terms are linear in COTS density, which can overestimate predation rates during outbreaks and may not reproduce the sharp boom-bust cycles observed in nature. In reality, COTS feeding rates saturate at high densities due to handling time and interference.

Improvement:
I have introduced a Holling Type II (saturating) functional response for COTS predation on both fast and slow coral. This adds handling time parameters (h_fast, h_slow), limiting maximum predation rates at high COTS densities. This mechanism is ecologically justified and should improve the model's ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events, as well as the characteristic boom-bust cycles.

Parameters added:
- log_h_fast: Log handling time for COTS predation on fast coral (year)
- log_h_slow: Log handling time for COTS predation on slow coral (year)

Mathematical form:
pred_fast = (alpha_fast * cots_prev * fast_prev) / (1 + h_fast * alpha_fast * cots_prev)
pred_slow = (alpha_slow * cots_prev * slow_prev) / (1 + h_slow * alpha_slow * cots_prev)

This change is expected to produce more realistic outbreak dynamics and prevent unrealistically high predation rates during COTS booms.
