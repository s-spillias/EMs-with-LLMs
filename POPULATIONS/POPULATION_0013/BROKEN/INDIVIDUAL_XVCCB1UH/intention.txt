Assessment:
- The current model captures many key processes for COTS outbreaks (density dependence, selective predation, environmental drivers, outbreak threshold).
- However, the resource limitation on COTS growth is modeled as a linear function of total coral cover, which oversimplifies the true relationship.
- Empirical evidence and ecological theory suggest COTS population growth saturates at moderate coral cover, and low coral cover strongly limits recovery after outbreaks.
- This linearity may cause the model to over-predict COTS recovery and under-predict the duration of bust phases, limiting its ability to reproduce observed boom-bust cycles.

Improvement:
- Replace the linear coral limitation term in the COTS growth equation with a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) function: coral_total_prev / (K_coral_half + coral_total_prev).
- Add a new parameter, log_K_coral_half, representing the coral cover at which COTS growth is half-maximal.
- This non-linear resource limitation is ecologically justified and should improve the model's ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks and busts.
