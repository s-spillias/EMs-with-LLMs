Assessment:
- The previous model was numerically unstable, likely due to complex functional responses and secondary ecological effects.
- To stabilise the model and focus on core dynamics, I have simplified the ecological relationships:
  - COTS population now follows basic logistic growth with linear mortality and immigration.
  - Coral groups (fast and slow) follow logistic recovery with linear predation by COTS (Lotka-Volterra type).
  - All secondary effects (e.g., saturating functional responses, environmental modifiers, resource thresholds, assimilation efficiency) are temporarily removed.
- Additional numerical safety: The model now returns a large penalty if any parameter, initial condition, or state variable is NA/NaN/Inf at any point, using R_finite checks throughout.
- This simplification should ensure numerical stability and allow assessment of the dominant boom-bust cycles and predation feedbacks.
- Once the core model is stable and fits the data, complexity (e.g., non-linear predation, environmental effects) can be reintroduced as justified by residuals and ecological reasoning.

No new parameters were added or removed in this step.
