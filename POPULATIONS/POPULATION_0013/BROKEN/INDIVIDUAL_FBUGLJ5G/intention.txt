Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and includes process-based predictions for each. However, without the residuals file, a quantitative assessment of fit is not possible here. Qualitatively, the model structure is reasonable for capturing general population trends.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model includes COTS-coral interactions, outbreak triggers, and environmental (SST) and immigration effects. It attempts to capture boom-bust cycles via resource limitation and outbreak thresholds. However, the outbreak dynamics may be too tightly coupled to instantaneous coral cover, and the feedback from coral depletion to COTS decline may be oversimplified.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model assumes linear predation rates (Holling Type II functional response) and fixed assimilation efficiencies. It does not account for possible non-linear or saturating effects in COTS recruitment or predation, nor for density-dependent feedbacks in COTS larval survival that could sustain or abruptly end outbreaks.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the episodic and sometimes abrupt nature of COTS outbreaks (boom-bust cycles), I will introduce a saturating (non-linear) effect of larval immigration on COTS recruitment. This reflects ecological reality: at high larval supply, recruitment may saturate due to density-dependent mortality or resource limitation, preventing unrealistically large outbreaks. This is implemented as a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) function for the immigration effect in the COTS process model.

Justification:
- Ecologically, COTS outbreaks are often triggered by pulses of larval supply, but not all larvae survive to adulthood due to density-dependent processes (e.g., cannibalism, predation, limited settlement substrate).
- A saturating function prevents runaway population explosions and allows for more realistic outbreak magnitudes and durations.
- This change adds only one parameter (the half-saturation constant), balancing realism and parsimony.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: log_immig_half ("Log half-saturation constant for larval immigration effect").
- Replace the linear immigration effect with a Michaelis-Menten saturating function in the COTS process model.
