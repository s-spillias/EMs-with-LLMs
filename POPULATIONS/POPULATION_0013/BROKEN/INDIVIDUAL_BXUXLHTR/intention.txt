Assessment:
- The current model captures COTS boom-bust cycles via density dependence, SST effects, and a smooth outbreak threshold.
- However, it lacks a direct feedback from coral availability to COTS recruitment, which is ecologically critical for realistic bust phases after outbreaks.
- Without this, the model may overpredict the persistence or magnitude of outbreaks, as COTS recruitment does not decrease when coral is depleted.

Improvement:
- Add a resource limitation mechanism to COTS recruitment: make COTS recruitment a saturating function of total coral cover (fast + slow).
- This reflects that COTS larval survival and settlement are much lower when coral is scarce, providing a negative feedback that helps terminate outbreaks and matches observed boom-bust cycles.
- This is implemented as a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) function of coral cover in the COTS recruitment term.

Ecological justification:
- Strong empirical evidence shows COTS recruitment is food-limited, especially after coral depletion.
- This feedback is essential for realistic outbreak dynamics and is a moderate, justified increase in model complexity.
