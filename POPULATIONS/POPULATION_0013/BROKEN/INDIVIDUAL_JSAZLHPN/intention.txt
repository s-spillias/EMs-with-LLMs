Assessment:
1. The current model uses lagged values and lognormal likelihoods, and is structurally appropriate for fitting time series of COTS and coral cover. Without the residuals file, quantitative fit cannot be assessed, but the model is likely to capture general trends.
2. The model addresses the project context by including logistic COTS growth, resource limitation via coral cover, SST effects, and selective predation. However, the collapse phase of outbreaks may be poorly captured if COTS mortality is strictly density-independent.
3. A key ecological process that may be missing is density-dependent COTS mortality, which is important for triggering and sustaining the rapid decline phase of outbreaks.

Chosen improvement:
Add density-dependent COTS mortality by introducing a quadratic mortality term (m2_cots * N^2) in the COTS population equation. This reflects increased mortality due to predation, disease, or competition at high COTS densities, and is ecologically justified for capturing the bust phase of outbreaks. This change adds only one parameter and directly improves the model's ability to reproduce observed boom-bust cycles.
