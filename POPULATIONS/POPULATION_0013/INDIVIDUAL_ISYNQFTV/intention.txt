This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their predation on coral communities (fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp.). The model predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions by integrating key ecological processes: resource limitation (coral prey availability), environmental forcing (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval immigration), and feedbacks between COTS and coral cover. Outbreaks are triggered and sustained by favorable environmental conditions and high coral prey, while resource depletion and density-dependent feedbacks drive collapse. The model uses saturating and threshold functions to capture nonlinearities in predation and recruitment, and incorporates process-specific efficiencies and environmental modifiers. All predictions are made using only lagged (previous time step) values of state variables to avoid data leakage, and the model is structured for robust likelihood-based inference using observed time series of COTS abundance and coral cover.
