Assessment:
- The current model structure is appropriate for simulating COTS-coral boom-bust cycles and selective predation, with resource limitation, SST effects, and immigration.
- However, the resource limitation for COTS recruitment uses a smooth sigmoid threshold on coral cover, which may be too gradual to capture the abrupt onset of outbreaks observed in the field.
- There is no explicit mechanism for sharp, threshold-like recruitment pulses that can trigger outbreaks.

Improvement:
- Add a "steepness" parameter to the sigmoid function controlling the effect of coral cover on COTS recruitment.
- This allows the threshold to be sharper, enabling the model to better capture the sudden transition to outbreak conditions when coral cover exceeds a critical value.
- This change is ecologically justified, minimally increases model complexity, and directly addresses the need to simulate abrupt outbreak dynamics as required by the project context.
