Model Assessment:
The current model establishes a solid predator-prey framework, incorporating logistic growth for two coral types and a Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation. It also includes important environmental drivers like SST-induced bleaching and key population processes such as reproductive Allee effects and larval immigration for COTS.

However, the model's ability to capture the characteristic "boom-bust" cycle of COTS outbreaks is limited. The "bust" phase is currently modeled using a generic density-dependent mortality term (m_C_dd), which does not mechanistically link the COTS population crash to the depletion of its coral food source. This is a significant oversimplification of the system's dynamics. The high literature-derived value for natural mortality (m_C) may be compensating for this missing starvation process.

Proposed Ecological Improvement:
To improve the model's ecological realism and its ability to simulate the full boom-bust cycle, I will introduce a starvation-induced mortality term for the COTS population. This term will make COTS mortality explicitly dependent on the availability of their food source (total coral cover).

Mathematical Formulation:
The COTS mortality rate will be augmented by a starvation component, M_starve, which increases as total coral cover (F + S) declines. The function is:
M_starve = m_starve_max * exp(-k_starve * (F + S))

This introduces two new parameters:
1.  `log_m_starve_max`: The log of the maximum starvation mortality rate, which occurs when coral cover approaches zero.
2.  `log_k_starve`: The log of the sensitivity of starvation mortality to coral availability, controlling how quickly the effect diminishes as food becomes more plentiful.

Justification:
This change directly addresses a core requirement of the project context: accurately modeling the boom-bust cycle. By mechanistically linking COTS mortality to resource availability, the model can more realistically simulate the population crash that follows the depletion of corals during an outbreak. This provides a stronger ecological foundation for the model's predictions regarding the duration and collapse of COTS outbreaks.
