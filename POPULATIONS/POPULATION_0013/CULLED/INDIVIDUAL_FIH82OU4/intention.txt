This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities, specifically fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites spp.) corals. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks by incorporating density-dependent self-regulation and resource limitation. COTS population growth is driven by predation on corals, modeled using a Holling Type II functional response that includes prey preference, and is supplemented by larval immigration events. Coral dynamics are governed by logistic growth, competition for space, and predation by COTS. The model also accounts for environmental influences, where elevated sea-surface temperatures can induce coral bleaching and mortality, affecting the food source for COTS and creating feedback loops within the ecosystem.
