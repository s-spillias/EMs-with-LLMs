This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites) coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model is designed to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks.

Ecological dynamics are represented by a system of difference equations:
1.  **COTS Population:** COTS growth is driven by the consumption of both coral types, modeled using a saturating Michaelis-Menten functional response. COTS population decline is due to a natural mortality rate that increases with sea surface temperature. Outbreaks are initiated by larval immigration events, which are included as a direct forcing variable.
2.  **Fast-Growing Coral:** The cover of fast-growing corals follows logistic growth, limited by available space and competition from slow-growing corals. Their growth rate is modulated by sea surface temperature, with an optimal temperature for peak growth. They are consumed by COTS.
3.  **Slow-Growing Coral:** The dynamics of slow-growing corals mirror those of fast-growing corals, with their own specific parameters for growth, carrying capacity, and temperature sensitivity. They also face competition and predation from COTS.

The model aims to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks by integrating predator-prey interactions, inter-specific coral competition, and the influence of key environmental drivers like temperature and larval supply.
