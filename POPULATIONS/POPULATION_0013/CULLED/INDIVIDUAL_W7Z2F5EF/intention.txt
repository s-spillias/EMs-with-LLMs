### Model Assessment
The current model establishes a robust framework for coral-COTS dynamics. It includes logistic growth for fast and slow corals, SST-driven bleaching mortality, and a Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation. The COTS population dynamics incorporate key ecological processes: an Allee effect for reproduction at low densities, density-dependent mortality at high densities, and starvation-induced mortality when coral food sources are depleted.

However, the mechanism for COTS reproduction is simplified. It assumes a constant conversion efficiency (`e_C`) from consumed coral to COTS biomass. This simplification overlooks the critical role of environmental conditions, particularly sea surface temperature (SST), in triggering COTS spawning and influencing larval survival. As a result, the model's ability to endogenously predict the timing and initiation of population outbreaks is limited, relying instead on an external immigration driver.

### Proposed Ecological Improvement
To better capture the boom-bust dynamics described in the project context, I will introduce a temperature-dependent reproductive success mechanism for COTS. This change addresses a key trigger for outbreak events on the Great Barrier Reef, where reproductive success is known to be highly correlated with SST.

**Improvement:** Modify the COTS growth (reproduction) equation to include a bell-shaped (Gaussian) response to SST.
**Justification:** COTS are broadcast spawners whose reproductive success is optimal within a specific temperature window. By incorporating this relationship, the model can use the existing `sst_dat` to simulate how favorable temperature conditions can trigger a population boom. This adds a crucial layer of ecological realism and enhances the model's predictive power regarding the timing of outbreaks.

This will be implemented by introducing two new parameters:
1.  `T_opt_cots`: The optimal temperature for COTS reproduction.
2.  `log_T_width_cots`: A parameter controlling the width of the optimal temperature window.

The COTS growth equation will be modified to include a temperature modulation factor, `Temp_Factor = exp( - (SST - T_opt_cots)^2 / T_width_cots^2 )`, which will scale the reproductive output based on the current SST.
