This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on two key coral groups on the Great Barrier Reef: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. The core of the model is a predator-prey system designed to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks.

Ecological dynamics are governed by the following principles:
- **Coral Growth**: Both fast and slow-growing corals exhibit logistic growth, competing for shared resources like space, up to a total carrying capacity. Coral growth is also influenced by Sea-Surface Temperature (SST), with an optimal temperature for growth and reduced growth at temperatures above or below this optimum.
- **COTS Predation**: COTS prey on both coral types. Predation is modeled using a multi-species Holling Type II functional response, which accounts for predator saturation at high coral densities. The model incorporates a feeding preference, with COTS preferentially consuming fast-growing corals but switching to slow-growing corals as the preferred food source becomes scarce.
- **COTS Population Dynamics**: COTS population growth is directly linked to their consumption of coral biomass, modulated by assimilation efficiencies. COTS mortality includes both a constant natural death rate and a density-dependent component, which represents increased mortality from factors like starvation and disease at high population densities. Episodic larval immigration events act as an external forcing, providing a mechanism to trigger or amplify population outbreaks.

The model's feedback loop is central to its behavior: COTS populations expand by consuming corals, leading to a decline in coral cover. The subsequent food scarcity causes the COTS population to crash, allowing the coral communities to begin a slow recovery, thus completing the boom-bust cycle.
