### Model Assessment

The current model provides a robust framework for simulating COTS-coral interactions, capturing essential dynamics such as boom-bust cycles through density-dependent mortality, starvation, and Allee effects. It also models selective predation on fast and slow corals and includes environmental drivers like SST and larval immigration.

However, a key ecological process is missing: the influence of larval food availability on COTS recruitment. The "larval starvation hypothesis" is a leading explanation for the initiation of COTS outbreaks, linking them to phytoplankton blooms.

### Proposed Improvement: Incorporate Larval Food Limitation

To enhance the model's ability to predict the timing and magnitude of episodic outbreaks, I will introduce larval food limitation as a modulator of COTS recruitment.

**Justification:**
This improvement directly addresses the project's goal of accurately modeling outbreak triggers. By making recruitment success dependent on larval food availability, the model gains a powerful, mechanistically-grounded driver for the episodic population explosions characteristic of COTS.

**Implementation (Revised):**
An initial implementation attempted to use a new forcing data stream for larval food (`lfood_dat`), which caused an error because the data was not available to the model environment.

To resolve this, the effect of larval food availability will instead be modeled as a function of Sea Surface Temperature (`sst_dat`), which is an existing input. This is an ecologically plausible simplification, as phytoplankton growth is temperature-dependent.

1.  **New Parameters:** Two new parameters, `T_opt_lfood` and `log_T_width_lfood`, will be introduced to define a Gaussian response curve. This allows the model to estimate the optimal temperature and tolerance range for larval food (phytoplankton) blooms.
2.  **Equation Modification:** The COTS growth (recruitment) equation will be updated. The `larval_food_effect` will be calculated as a Gaussian function of `sst_dat`. This makes the conversion efficiency of consumed coral into new recruits a variable process, dependent on temperature conditions that favor larval food. This approach removes the need for a new external data file, resolving the compilation error.
