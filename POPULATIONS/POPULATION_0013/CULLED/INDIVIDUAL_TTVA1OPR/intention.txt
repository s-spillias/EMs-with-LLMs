Model Assessment:
1.  Fit and Context: The current model structure includes key non-linearities (Holling Type II predation, Allee effect, density-dependent mortality) necessary to produce boom-bust cycles. It addresses the project context by including selective predation, external outbreak triggers, and mechanisms for population growth and decline. The "bust" phase is driven by food limitation and a quadratic density-dependent mortality term.

2.  Oversimplification: A key oversimplification is the static nature of the COTS mortality parameters. In reality, the coral structure itself provides a refuge for COTS. As COTS consume coral, they destroy their habitat, become more exposed, and are concentrated on remaining patches. This should increase mortality rates, especially density-dependent effects, creating a strong negative feedback that accelerates the population crash. The current model, with a constant density-dependent mortality coefficient (m_C_dd), does not capture this dynamic.

Proposed Improvement:
1.  Ecological Rationale: I will introduce a habitat-refuge feedback mechanism by making the COTS density-dependent mortality coefficient (m_C_dd) a function of coral cover. As total coral cover (F+S) declines, the effective density-dependent mortality will increase. This represents the loss of refuge, forcing COTS into smaller areas, increasing competition, and making them more vulnerable to predators and other density-related pressures. This change will enhance the model's ability to realistically simulate the sharp "bust" phase of the outbreak cycle.

2.  Mathematical Implementation: The density-dependent mortality coefficient will be modified as follows:
    `m_C_dd_eff = m_C_dd * (1 + s_dd_refuge / (F_prev + S_prev + epsilon))`
    A new parameter, `s_dd_refuge`, will be introduced to control the strength of this feedback. A higher `s_dd_refuge` value means that the loss of coral cover has a stronger effect on increasing density-dependent mortality.

Parameter Justification:
A new parameter `log_s_dd_refuge` is added to `parameters.json`. This parameter is introduced as part of model development to capture a key ecological process. Its source is "initial estimate" and its priority is 3, reflecting its role as a new structural parameter. The bounds are set to allow for a wide range of possible strengths for this feedback mechanism.
