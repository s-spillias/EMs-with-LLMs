This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) and their interaction with two coral types: fast-growing (e.g., Acropora) and slow-growing (e.g., Faviidae, Porites). The model aims to capture the boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks. COTS population growth is driven by the consumption of coral, influenced by sea-surface temperature, and supplemented by external larval immigration which can trigger outbreaks. COTS predation on corals is modeled using a saturating functional response with a preference for fast-growing species. The two coral types compete for space, with fast-growing corals having a higher intrinsic growth rate. The feedback loop where COTS over-exploit their coral food source, leading to a subsequent COTS population crash, is a central feature of the model.
