Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating COTS-coral dynamics, incorporating logistic coral growth, selective COTS predation, and environmental effects like bleaching. The structure correctly identifies key drivers for the "boom" phase of COTS outbreaks, linking predator growth to prey availability.

Identified Issue and Rationale for Change:
A critical assessment of the model's mathematical structure revealed a dimensional inconsistency in the COTS growth equation. The equation attempts to add a term with units of "% cover / year" (from coral consumption) to the COTS population state variable, which has units of "individuals / m²". This is mathematically invalid and ecologically unrealistic. The link between consumed food and predator population growth is fundamentally misrepresented.

Proposed Ecological Improvement:
To correct this, I am introducing a new scaling parameter, `Q_C` (estimated as `log_Q_C`), which explicitly converts the quantity of consumed coral (in `% cover`) into new COTS density (in `individuals / m²`).

The COTS growth equation is modified as follows:
Original: growth = e_C * (coral_consumption)
Corrected: growth = Q_C * e_C * (coral_consumption)

In this new formulation:
- `Q_C` is the scaling factor representing COTS individuals produced per unit of % coral cover consumed. Its units are `(ind m⁻²) / %`.
- `e_C` remains the dimensionless physiological conversion efficiency.

This change is the most meaningful improvement because it establishes a mathematically sound and ecologically realistic foundation for the model. Without this correction, any model predictions or further additions (like starvation) would be based on a flawed core dynamic, making them unreliable. This structural fix is essential for accurately capturing the boom-bust cycles described in the project context.
