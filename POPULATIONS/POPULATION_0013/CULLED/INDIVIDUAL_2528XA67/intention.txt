Model Assessment:
The current model provides a robust framework for COTS dynamics, incorporating essential mechanisms like selective predation on corals, an Allee effect for reproduction, and predator satiation to enable outbreaks. The "bust" phase is driven by food limitation and density-dependent mortality. While structurally sound, the model is missing a critical feedback mechanism: the influence of reef structural complexity on COTS vulnerability to predation. The project context emphasizes capturing outbreak triggers, and the interaction between habitat structure and predation is a key hypothesis for this process.

Proposed Improvement:
Introduce a habitat-mediated refuge effect for COTS. The structural complexity provided by coral cover offers COTS protection from predators. This change introduces a powerful feedback loop that links the state of the coral community directly to the outbreak potential of the COTS population.

Mechanism:
The improvement is implemented by making the COTS predator-escape density (`C_escape`) a dynamic function of total coral cover (`F_prev + S_prev`). The new relationship is `C_escape_effective = C_escape_base * exp(-k_refuge * TotalCoral)`.

1.  `log_C_escape` is renamed to `log_C_escape_base` to represent the baseline escape density in an environment with zero coral cover (no refuges).
2.  A new parameter, `log_k_refuge`, is introduced to quantify the strength of the refuge effect. A higher `k_refuge` means coral cover provides a stronger protective effect.

Ecological Justification:
This change introduces a more realistic, dynamic representation of predation.
- When coral cover is high, `C_escape_effective` is low. This means COTS can swamp their predators at a lower density, making it easier for an outbreak to "ignite" from a small population. This creates a destabilizing positive feedback: more coral -> less predation -> more COTS -> less coral.
- As COTS decimate the coral, cover decreases, and `C_escape_effective` increases. COTS become more exposed and vulnerable, requiring a much larger population to satiate predators. This increased predation pressure helps drive the "bust" phase of the cycle.
This mechanism directly addresses the project goal of modeling the triggers and drivers of episodic outbreaks by making the reef's state an active participant in the COTS population dynamics.
