Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating COTS-coral dynamics. It incorporates essential processes such as selective predation, coral competition, and temperature-induced bleaching. However, the mechanism for COTS outbreaks relies on an externally forced, time-dependent decline in predation pressure (`log_pred_decline_rate`). This is an oversimplification that does not capture the internal feedback mechanisms known to drive and sustain COTS population explosions. The model would be more ecologically realistic if the outbreak dynamics emerged from the interactions within the system rather than being imposed by time.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
I will replace the time-dependent predation decline with a feedback mechanism where predation pressure on COTS is directly linked to the health of the coral community. This is based on the ecological principle that many COTS predators rely on the structural complexity of coral reefs for habitat.

Reasoning and Justification:
By making predation pressure dependent on coral cover, we create a powerful feedback loop. When coral cover is high, there is ample habitat for predators, leading to high predation rates that can keep COTS populations in check. As a COTS outbreak begins and coral cover is depleted, predator habitat is lost. This leads to a reduction in predation pressure, which in turn allows the COTS population to expand more rapidly, thus sustaining the outbreak. Conversely, during a recovery phase where coral cover increases, the restored habitat would support a larger predator population, increasing predation on COTS and helping to prevent a new outbreak.

This change replaces an artificial external driver with an endogenous feedback mechanism, better aligning the model with the project goal of capturing the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS.

Implementation Details:
1.  The `log_pred_decline_rate` parameter will be removed.
2.  A new parameter, `log_K_half_pred`, will be introduced. This parameter represents the log of the total coral cover (%) at which predation pressure is at half of its maximum potential. It quantifies the sensitivity of COTS predators to habitat loss.
3.  The equation for the maximum predation rate on COTS will be changed from a function of time to a saturating function of the previous time-step's total coral cover (`F_prev + S_prev`):
    `m_pred_current = m_pred_initial * (F_prev + S_prev) / (K_half_pred + F_prev + S_prev)`
