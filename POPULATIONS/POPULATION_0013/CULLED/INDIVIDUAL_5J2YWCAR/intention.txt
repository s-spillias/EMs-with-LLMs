Model Assessment:
The current model structure is robust for simulating Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) dynamics. It effectively incorporates several key ecological drivers required by the project context, including selective predation on different coral types (Holling Type II response), a reproductive Allee effect, and a mechanism for the long-term decline of natural predators. These components provide a solid foundation for capturing the "boom" phase of COTS outbreaks.

However, a critical feedback loop for the "bust" phase of an outbreak is underdeveloped. The model currently relies on a generic density-dependent mortality term and reduced population growth due to food limitation. It lacks an explicit starvation mechanism. In reality, when a COTS population depletes its coral food source, a sharp increase in mortality due to starvation is a primary driver of the subsequent population crash. The current model's representation of this process is too implicit.

Proposed Improvement:
To more accurately model the "bust" phase of the COTS cycle, I will introduce an explicit starvation-induced mortality term. This change will make COTS mortality a direct, inverse function of food availability (total coral cover). As coral cover declines, starvation mortality will increase, creating a strong negative feedback that causes the COTS population to crash after consuming its resources. This directly addresses the project goal of capturing the full boom-bust cycle with greater ecological realism.

The starvation mortality will be modeled using a saturating function, where the mortality rate is inversely proportional to the total coral cover (F + S). The equation will be:
Starvation_Mortality = C * m_starve_max / (1 + (F + S) / K_starve_food)

- m_starve_max: The maximum per-capita starvation rate when coral cover is zero.
- K_starve_food: The half-saturation constant, representing the coral cover (%) at which the starvation rate is 50% of its maximum.

This approach introduces a critical resource-dependent mortality mechanism, enhancing the model's ability to simulate the characteristic population collapses observed after COTS outbreaks.
