Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating COTS boom-bust cycles. It includes key processes like selective predation (Holling Type II), coral competition, temperature-driven bleaching, and complex COTS population dynamics (Allee effect, predator satiation, density-dependent mortality). This structure addresses the core requirements of the project context.

Missing/Oversimplified Processes:
A critical hypothesis for the increased prevalence of COTS outbreaks is the long-term decline of COTS predators (e.g., giant triton, certain large fish) due to overfishing and habitat degradation. The current model assumes a constant maximum predation rate (`m_pred`), which fails to capture this long-term ecological shift. This simplification means the model may struggle to explain why outbreaks might become more frequent or severe over the decades covered by the time series data.

Proposed Improvement: Time-Varying Predation Pressure
To better capture the mechanisms that can trigger or exacerbate outbreaks, I will introduce a time-varying predation pressure on COTS. This reflects the hypothesis of declining predator populations over time.

Ecological Rationale:
By making the maximum predation rate (`m_pred`) a dynamic variable that decays exponentially over time, the model can simulate a system becoming progressively more susceptible to outbreaks. A lower predation rate means that COTS populations can more easily escape predator control at lower densities, increasing the likelihood that a larval influx (`cotsimm_dat`) or a local reproductive pulse will ignite a full-blown outbreak. This change introduces a key environmental modifier (declining predator abundance) that acts as a long-term driver, directly addressing the project's goal of understanding outbreak triggers.

Implementation:
1. The parameter `log_m_pred` will be repurposed as `log_m_pred_initial`, representing the predation rate at the start of the time series.
2. A new parameter, `log_pred_decline_rate`, will be introduced to represent the annual exponential decay rate of predation pressure.
3. The predation mortality term in `model.cpp` will be modified to use this time-dependent predation rate: `m_pred(t) = m_pred_initial * exp(-pred_decline_rate * (Year(t) - Year(0)))`.

This approach adds minimal complexity (one new parameter) while introducing a powerful and ecologically plausible mechanism to improve the model's explanatory power regarding long-term trends in COTS outbreaks.
