Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and predicts time series for each. Without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible, but the structure is appropriate for time series fitting.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model captures COTS boom-bust cycles via density-dependent recruitment, SST-modulated recruitment, and a smooth outbreak threshold. It also includes selective predation on two coral types and feedbacks from coral availability.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model currently assumes that COTS recruitment is only limited by its own density, SST, and a smooth outbreak threshold. However, it does not include explicit negative feedback from coral depletion on COTS recruitment, which is ecologically important: severe coral loss should reduce COTS recruitment and help terminate outbreaks.

Chosen Improvement:
I will add a resource limitation mechanism to COTS recruitment by including a saturating function of total coral cover (fast + slow) in the COTS recruitment term. This reflects that COTS larvae require sufficient coral for settlement and survival, and that outbreaks cannot be sustained when coral is depleted. This feedback is ecologically justified and should improve the model's ability to capture the decline phase of outbreaks and prevent unrealistically prolonged high COTS densities.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter `logit_coral_recruit_sens` to control the sensitivity of COTS recruitment to coral cover (on a 0-1 scale).
- Modify the COTS recruitment term in model.cpp to multiply by a saturating function of total coral cover.
- Document the new parameter in parameters.json with ecological justification.
