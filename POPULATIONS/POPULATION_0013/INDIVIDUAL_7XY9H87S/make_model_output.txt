 Assessment of Current Model:                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 1. Model Fit:                                                                                                                                                                                                         
    - Without the residuals file, direct quantitative assessment is not possible, but the model structure suggests it should capture general trends in COTS and coral cover dynamics.                                  
    - The model uses lognormal likelihoods and process/observation error, which are appropriate for ecological time series.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 2. Addressing Project Context:                                                                                                                                                                                        
    - The model includes COTS population dynamics with density dependence, resource limitation (via coral cover), environmental covariates (SST, larval immigration), and selective predation on fast/slow coral types 
    - Outbreaks are modeled with a smooth threshold function, modulated by SST and immigration.                                                                                                                        
    - The model should be able to generate boom-bust cycles, but the outbreak mechanism is a simple threshold on COTS density.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 3. Missing or Oversimplified Processes:                                                                                                                                                                               
    - The outbreak mechanism is a smooth threshold on COTS density, but does not explicitly include feedbacks from coral depletion or delayed density dependence.                                                      
    - The model assumes immediate response of COTS to environmental triggers, but in reality, outbreaks may be sustained or terminated by time-lagged feedbacks (e.g., coral depletion reducing future COTS            
 recruitment).                                                                                                                                                                                                         
    - Coral recovery is modeled as logistic growth, but does not include competitive interactions between coral types or variable recovery rates after disturbance.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 **Introduce a delayed negative feedback from coral depletion on COTS recruitment, representing the ecological reality that severe coral loss during outbreaks reduces food availability for subsequent COTS           
 generations, helping to terminate outbreaks and drive bust phases.**                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Justification:                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 - This feedback is ecologically well-supported and is a key mechanism for the collapse of COTS outbreaks.                                                                                                             
 - It can be implemented by modifying the COTS recruitment/growth term to include a saturating function of total coral cover from the previous time step (e.g., Michaelis-Menten or Hill function).                    
 - This introduces nonlinearity and time-lagged feedback, improving the model's ability to capture the timing and duration of boom-bust cycles without excessive complexity.                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Implementation:                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 - Add a new parameter: "log_gamma_coral" (log half-saturation constant for coral feedback on COTS recruitment).                                                                                                       
 - Modify the COTS growth term so that recruitment is multiplied by (coral_total_prev / (gamma_coral + coral_total_prev)), where coral_total_prev is total coral cover at t-1.                                         
 - This ensures that when coral is abundant, COTS can recruit efficiently, but when coral is depleted, recruitment is strongly limited, helping to end outbreaks.
