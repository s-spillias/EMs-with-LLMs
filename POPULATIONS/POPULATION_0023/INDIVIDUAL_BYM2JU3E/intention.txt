MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model includes comprehensive mechanisms for COTS outbreak dynamics:
- Age-structured population (juveniles and adults)
- Coral refuge effects reducing juvenile mortality
- Temperature-dependent recruitment
- Nutrient-driven larval survival with outbreak threshold
- Density-dependent settlement limitation
- Allee effects on reproduction
- Type II functional responses for coral consumption

=== ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED ===

Critical Missing Mechanism: PREDATOR SATURATION

The current model uses a simple density-dependent mortality term (dd_mortality) that increases 
linearly with COTS density, representing crowding stress. However, this misses a fundamental 
ecological process documented in COTS outbreak literature:

PREDATOR SATURATION DURING OUTBREAKS:
- At low COTS densities: Natural predators (giant triton Charonia tritonis, humphead wrasse, 
  pufferfish) effectively control populations through predation
- At high COTS densities: Predators become SATURATED - they cannot consume COTS fast enough, 
  leading to "predation release"
- This creates a critical THRESHOLD effect: once COTS densities exceed predator handling capacity,
  populations can explode into outbreak conditions

This mechanism is essential for explaining:
1. Why outbreaks are so explosive once initiated (escape from predation control)
2. Why outbreaks persist at high densities (predators remain saturated)
3. The characteristic threshold behavior of outbreak events
4. Why recovery is slow (populations must decline below saturation threshold)

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Replace simple juvenile mortality with a PREDATOR SATURATION FUNCTION using a Type III 
functional response:

predation_mortality = max_predation_rate * (juvenile_density^2) / (K_predation^2 + juvenile_density^2)

Where:
- max_predation_rate: Maximum per-capita predation rate when predators are unsaturated
- K_predation: Half-saturation density (density at which predation is 50% of maximum)
- Quadratic numerator creates accelerating predation at low densities (predator aggregation)
- Saturation in denominator creates predation release at high densities

This creates three ecological regimes:
1. LOW DENSITY (< K_predation): Strong predation control, population stable
2. THRESHOLD ZONE (≈ K_predation): Unstable equilibrium, small perturbations can trigger outbreak
3. HIGH DENSITY (> K_predation): Predation release, outbreak conditions, population limited by 
   food/space rather than predation

=== IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ===

New Parameters Added:
1. log_max_predation_rate: Maximum per-capita predation mortality rate on juveniles when predators
   are unsaturated (year^-1). Expected range: 0.5-2.0 year^-1 based on predator consumption rates.

2. log_K_predation: Half-saturation density for predator functional response (individuals/m2).
   This is the critical threshold density. Expected range: 0.01-0.5 ind/m2 based on observed
   outbreak thresholds (outbreaks typically defined as >0.22 ind/m2).

Modified Parameters:
- log_m_cots_juvenile: Now represents baseline non-predation mortality (disease, starvation, 
  physical stress) rather than total mortality. Expected to be lower than previous values since
  predation is now handled separately.

Ecological Justification:
- Giant triton (primary COTS predator) has been overfished on GBR, reducing predation capacity
- Type III response reflects predator learning/aggregation at intermediate densities
- Saturation reflects finite predator abundance and handling time constraints
- Creates bistability: stable low-density state vs. stable outbreak state
- Matches empirical observations of threshold outbreak behavior

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

This modification should:
1. Create more realistic boom-bust outbreak cycles with sharp transitions
2. Generate threshold behavior where small increases in larval supply can trigger outbreaks
3. Produce persistent outbreaks once initiated (predators remain saturated)
4. Allow recovery only when COTS decline below predation threshold
5. Interact with coral refuge effect: high coral → low baseline mortality → easier to exceed 
   predation threshold → outbreak more likely

This represents a fundamental ecological mechanism missing from the current model and should
significantly improve the model's ability to capture the episodic, threshold-driven nature of
COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef.
