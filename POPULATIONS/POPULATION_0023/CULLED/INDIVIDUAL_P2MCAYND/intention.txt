MODEL ASSESSMENT:
=================

Current Model Structure:
- COTS population with Allee effects, temperature-dependent recruitment, density-dependent mortality
- Two coral functional groups (fast: Acropora; slow: Faviidae/Porites)
- Type II functional response with preference for fast-growing coral
- Immigration of COTS larvae

Key Finding from Literature-Updated Parameters:
The baseline COTS mortality rate (log_mort_cots) has been updated to 0.942 (95% CI: 0.939-0.944), 
corresponding to a mortality rate of ~2.56 year⁻¹. This is very high - implying COTS have a 
half-life of only ~3.2 months under baseline conditions.

Critical Gap Identified:
With such high baseline mortality, the current recruitment formulation is insufficient to generate 
the explosive outbreak dynamics observed in nature. The Allee effect saturates at 1.0 and temperature 
effects are additive (1 + effect), limiting the maximum recruitment boost. Real COTS outbreaks are 
driven by episodic events where larval survival increases by orders of magnitude.

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:
===================================

Added: Nutrient-Enhanced Larval Survival Mechanism

Ecological Justification:
COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef are strongly linked to nutrient pulses (from river runoff, 
upwelling, or cyclone-driven mixing) that trigger phytoplankton blooms. These blooms dramatically 
increase food availability for COTS larvae, boosting survival from typically <0.01% to potentially 
>1% - a 100-fold increase. This creates the "boom" phase of boom-bust cycles.

Mathematical Implementation:
Added a new multiplicative term to recruitment that represents variable larval survival conditions:
- log_larval_survival_boost: Controls the magnitude of recruitment enhancement during favorable conditions
- This multiplier acts on the recruitment term, allowing it to occasionally spike dramatically
- Combined with high baseline mortality, this creates episodic outbreak dynamics

The recruitment equation now becomes:
recruitment = r_cots * allee_factor * temp_factor * larval_survival_boost * (1 - N/K)

Where larval_survival_boost can range from ~0.1 (poor conditions) to ~10 (exceptional conditions),
representing the 100-fold variation in larval survival documented in the literature.

Expected Dynamics:
- Most years: High mortality (2.56/year) exceeds modest recruitment → population declines
- Favorable years: Larval survival boost creates recruitment spike → outbreak initiation
- Outbreak phase: High density triggers density-dependent mortality → eventual crash
- This generates the characteristic episodic boom-bust pattern

Parameter Bounds:
- Lower bound: -2.303 (boost = 0.1, representing poor larval survival)
- Upper bound: 2.303 (boost = 10, representing exceptional larval survival conditions)
- Initial value: 0.0 (boost = 1.0, representing average conditions)

This single addition provides a mechanistically-justified way to generate episodic outbreaks
while maintaining the high baseline mortality rate indicated by the literature.
