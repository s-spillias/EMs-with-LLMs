MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements age-structured COTS dynamics with several sophisticated mechanisms:
1. Predator saturation (Type III functional response) as the primary outbreak trigger
2. Coral refuge effects protecting juvenile survival
3. Allee effects on adult reproduction
4. Temperature and nutrient modulation of recruitment
5. Density-dependent settlement limitation

These mechanisms address key aspects of COTS outbreak dynamics, but there is a critical temporal gap.

=== KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED ===

The model currently treats larval recruitment as instantaneous - larvae produced by adults in time step t immediately become juveniles in the same time step. This oversimplifies a crucial phase of COTS ecology:

COTS LARVAL BIOLOGY:
- Planktonic larval duration: 14-28 days (temperature-dependent)
- Larval mortality: Very high (>99% in most years)
- Larval food: Phytoplankton (nutrient-dependent availability)
- Dispersal: Larvae can travel 10s-100s of km before settlement
- Development rate: Temperature-dependent (faster in warm water)

ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF MISSING LARVAL DYNAMICS:
1. TIMING: No temporal lag between spawning and recruitment events
2. MAGNITUDE: Cannot capture larval accumulation effects that amplify recruitment pulses
3. SYNCHRONIZATION: Cannot explain coordinated outbreak initiation across multiple reefs
4. NUTRIENT EFFECTS: Current nutrient response is applied instantaneously rather than during larval development period

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: EXPLICIT LARVAL POOL DYNAMICS ===

Add a new state variable: LARVAL POOL (larvae/m2 in the water column)

MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE:

dL/dt = Larval_Production - Larval_Mortality - Larval_Settlement

Where:
- Larval_Production = Adult reproduction × spawning efficiency × temperature effect × Allee effect
- Larval_Mortality = (baseline_larval_mortality + nutrient_dependent_predation) × L
- Larval_Settlement = development_rate × settlement_success × L → becomes juvenile recruitment

KEY PARAMETERS:
1. log_larval_mortality_base: Baseline larval mortality rate (day^-1, very high ~0.1-0.5)
2. log_development_rate: Rate of larval development to competent settlers (day^-1, ~0.03-0.07)
3. larval_predation_nutrient_effect: How phytoplankton blooms reduce larval predation (0-1 scale)
4. spawning_to_larval_efficiency: Conversion of spawned eggs to viable larvae (0-1 scale)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:

1. TEMPORAL REALISM: Creates 2-4 week lag between spawning and recruitment, matching COTS biology
2. OUTBREAK AMPLIFICATION: Larval pool can accumulate during favorable conditions (warm, high nutrients), then pulse into massive recruitment events
3. NUTRIENT MECHANISM: Phytoplankton blooms reduce larval predation by fish/invertebrates (predator swamping), more realistic than direct nutrient→COTS conversion
4. SPATIAL COUPLING: Larval pool represents regional connectivity (though spatial structure not explicit in this model)
5. BOOM-BUST DYNAMICS: Larval pool can crash rapidly when conditions deteriorate, contributing to bust phase

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:

1. Add larval_pred state variable to track larval pool density
2. Modify adult reproduction to produce larvae (not directly juveniles)
3. Add larval mortality equation with nutrient-dependent predation
4. Add larval settlement equation producing juvenile recruitment
5. Retain all existing mechanisms (predator saturation, coral refuge, etc.)

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding critical temporal dynamics that are essential for accurately capturing outbreak timing and magnitude as specified in the PROJECT CONTEXT.

=== PARAMETER UPDATES ===

Several new parameters required:
- log_larval_mortality_base: High baseline mortality during planktonic phase
- log_development_rate: Temperature-dependent development to settlement competency
- larval_predation_reduction: Nutrient effect reducing predation on larvae (0-1)
- spawning_efficiency: Fraction of reproductive output becoming viable larvae

Existing parameters to modify:
- larval_survival_efficiency: Now represents settlement success rather than total larval survival
- nutrient effects: Now act on larval predation rather than direct recruitment boost

This change better aligns the model with COTS life history and provides mechanistic basis for outbreak synchronization and amplification.
