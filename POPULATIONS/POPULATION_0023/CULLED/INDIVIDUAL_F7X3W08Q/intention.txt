MODEL ASSESSMENT:
=================

Current State:
- Model includes COTS-coral dynamics with temperature effects, Allee effects, and Type II functional responses
- Temperature optimum (28.5°C) has been updated from literature with tight bounds (28.0-29.0°C)
- Immigration forcing is present but not environmentally modulated
- Model captures basic predator-prey dynamics but lacks key outbreak trigger mechanisms

Key Gap Identified:
- COTS outbreaks on the GBR are episodic and strongly linked to environmental conditions
- Larval recruitment success depends critically on phytoplankton availability during 2-4 week pelagic phase
- Flood events deliver nutrients → phytoplankton blooms → enhanced larval survival → outbreak initiation
- Current model treats immigration as a fixed forcing without environmental modulation

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
====================

Addition: Nutrient-Mediated Larval Survival Efficiency

Ecological Justification:
1. COTS larvae require phytoplankton food during pelagic development
2. Nutrient pulses from river runoff create phytoplankton blooms
3. Larval survival can increase 10-100x during bloom conditions
4. This creates the episodic recruitment pulses that trigger outbreaks
5. Provides mechanistic link between environmental forcing and boom-bust cycles

Mathematical Implementation:
- Add larval survival efficiency parameter (log_larval_survival_efficiency)
- Add half-saturation parameter for nutrient response (log_nutrient_half_sat)
- Modify COTS recruitment to include: immigration × nutrient_effect × larval_survival_efficiency
- Nutrient effect uses saturating (Michaelis-Menten) response: nutrient / (half_saturation + nutrient)
- Currently set to nutrient_effect = 1.0 (no modulation) until nutrient_dat is provided

Implementation Status:
- Parameters added to parameters.json (log_larval_survival_efficiency, log_nutrient_half_sat)
- Model structure updated to include larval survival efficiency in recruitment equation
- Nutrient data vector (nutrient_dat) defined in parameters.json but not yet in model.cpp
- Waiting for nutrient forcing data to be provided before activating full nutrient response
- When nutrient_dat becomes available, will activate: nutrient_effect = nutrient_curr / (nutrient_half_sat + nutrient_curr + eps)

Expected Outcomes (when nutrient data is provided):
1. Episodic recruitment pulses when nutrients are high
2. Enhanced boom phase initiation during favorable conditions
3. More realistic outbreak timing and magnitude
4. Interaction with existing Allee effect creates threshold dynamics
5. Better capture of characteristic COTS outbreak patterns

Current Model Behavior:
- Larval survival efficiency parameter is active and being estimated
- Acts as a constant multiplier on immigration (nutrient_effect = 1.0)
- This allows the model to estimate baseline larval survival efficiency
- Once nutrient data is added, the efficiency will be modulated by nutrient availability

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding a critical mechanistic pathway for outbreak dynamics that is well-supported by GBR ecology literature.
