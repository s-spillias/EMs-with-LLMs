MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Age-structured COTS population captures juvenile-adult dynamics
- Coral refuge effect on juvenile mortality creates realistic feedback
- Temperature and nutrient effects on larval recruitment
- Type II functional response for coral consumption
- Allee effects prevent unrealistic low-density persistence

Weaknesses Identified:
1. Nutrient forcing currently disabled (using constant value) - limits outbreak triggering
2. Missing cooperative feeding behavior during high COTS densities
3. Linear coral-carrying capacity relationship may underestimate outbreak potential
4. No mechanism for sustained high consumption rates during outbreak peaks

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: COOPERATIVE FEEDING ENHANCEMENT ===

Rationale:
Crown-of-Thorns starfish exhibit well-documented aggregation and cooperative feeding behavior during outbreak conditions. When COTS density is high, individuals:
- Aggregate on coral colonies in feeding fronts
- Overwhelm coral chemical defenses through coordinated feeding
- Achieve higher per-capita consumption rates than solitary individuals
- Reduce handling time through group feeding dynamics

This cooperative feeding is CRITICAL for:
- Sustaining outbreak magnitude (keeping COTS densities high)
- Extending outbreak duration (maintaining high consumption even as coral declines)
- Creating the characteristic rapid coral loss during outbreak peaks
- Generating boom-bust dynamics (positive feedback accelerates boom, then crash when coral depleted)

Mathematical Implementation:
Add a density-dependent feeding enhancement multiplier that increases attack rates when adult COTS density exceeds a cooperative feeding threshold. Use sigmoidal (Hill-type) function to capture:
- Minimal enhancement at low densities (individual feeding)
- Smooth transition at intermediate densities
- Maximum enhancement at high outbreak densities (full cooperative feeding)

New Parameters:
- log_coop_threshold: Log COTS density triggering cooperative feeding (individuals/m2)
- coop_enhancement_max: Maximum fold-increase in attack rates during cooperation (dimensionless, 1-5)
- coop_steepness: Steepness of transition to cooperative feeding (Hill coefficient, 1-4)

Equations Modified:
- Attack rates (log_attack_fast, log_attack_slow) multiplied by cooperative feeding factor
- Factor = 1 + (coop_enhancement_max - 1) * [adult_curr^coop_steepness / (coop_threshold^coop_steepness + adult_curr^coop_steepness)]

Expected Outcomes:
- More realistic outbreak peaks with accelerated coral consumption
- Better capture of boom-bust cycle timing and magnitude
- Improved fit to rapid coral decline phases during outbreaks
- Positive feedback sustains outbreaks longer before coral depletion triggers crash

This improvement directly addresses PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" and "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events."
