MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements core COTS-coral predator-prey dynamics with several sophisticated features:
- Type II functional responses for coral consumption (handling time limitations)
- Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response around optimal SST)
- Allee effects at low densities
- Density-dependent mortality at high densities
- Competition between fast and slow-growing coral types
- Feeding preferences for different coral types

However, a critical gap exists: the nutrient-mediated larval survival mechanism is defined but NOT IMPLEMENTED.

KEY MISSING MECHANISM:
The model has parameters for nutrient effects:
- log_larval_survival_efficiency (currently -1.609, representing ~20% baseline efficiency)
- log_nutrient_half_sat (currently 0.0, representing half-saturation at 1.0 nutrient units)

But nutrient_dat is not currently available in the dataset, so nutrient_effect is set to 1.0 (no effect).

This is the most critical missing piece for the PROJECT CONTEXT because:

ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE FOR OUTBREAK DYNAMICS:
1. COTS larvae are planktotrophic, feeding on phytoplankton during 2-3 week pelagic phase
2. Larval survival is typically <1% but can increase 10-20x during phytoplankton blooms
3. Nutrient pulses from terrestrial runoff (especially during flood events) trigger phytoplankton blooms
4. This creates the episodic trigger mechanism for outbreaks - when nutrient pulses coincide with spawning
5. Without this mechanism, the model cannot capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles driven by environmental conditions

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT (READY TO IMPLEMENT WHEN DATA AVAILABLE):
Implement the nutrient-mediated larval survival using a Michaelis-Menten (hyperbolic saturation) response:

nutrient_effect = nutrient_curr / (nutrient_half_sat + nutrient_curr + eps)

MATHEMATICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Michaelis-Menten form is standard for resource-limited biological processes
- Provides realistic saturation: at nutrient_half_sat, effect = 0.5
- Asymptotically approaches 1.0 at high nutrient levels
- Near-zero when nutrients are very low
- Captures the non-linear relationship between nutrient availability and larval food

ECOLOGICAL REALISM:
- At low nutrients (e.g., 0.1 units with half_sat=1.0): effect ≈ 0.09 (9% of maximum)
- At half-saturation (1.0): effect = 0.5 (50% of maximum)
- At high nutrients (10.0): effect ≈ 0.91 (91% of maximum)
- This matches observed patterns where larval survival increases dramatically but saturates

PARAMETER INTERPRETATION:
- log_larval_survival_efficiency: baseline conversion of immigration to recruitment under optimal conditions
- nutrient_effect: multiplier (0-1) based on current nutrient availability
- Combined effect: immigration × efficiency × nutrient_effect gives realized larval recruitment

CURRENT STATUS:
The nutrient mechanism is ready to be activated once nutrient_dat becomes available in the forcing data. The parameters are already defined and the mathematical framework is in place. Currently set to nutrient_effect = 1.0 to allow the model to run without nutrient data.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Currently line 109 sets nutrient_effect = Type(1.0) as placeholder
- When nutrient_dat is available, replace with: nutrient_effect = nutrient_curr / (nutrient_half_sat + nutrient_curr + eps)
- Uses nutrient_dat(t) as nutrient_curr (from forcing data)
- Maintains numerical stability with eps term in denominator
- No new parameters needed - uses existing log_nutrient_half_sat
- Preserves all other model dynamics unchanged
