ECOLOGICAL MODEL INTENTION: Crown-of-Thorns Starfish Outbreak Dynamics

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, capturing characteristic boom-bust population cycles and their impacts on coral communities.

KEY ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (critical for outbreak initiation)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival (warm years enhance recruitment)
   - Immigration of larvae from external sources (connectivity between reefs)
   - Density-dependent mortality at high densities (resource limitation, disease)
   - Natural mortality baseline

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Two functional groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites)
   - Logistic growth with carrying capacity
   - Differential recovery rates (fast-growing corals recover more quickly)
   - Competition for space between coral groups

3. COTS-Coral Interactions:
   - Type II functional response for coral consumption (saturation at high coral cover)
   - Preferential feeding on fast-growing corals (Acropora preferred over massive corals)
   - Coral availability limits COTS population growth
   - Feedback loop: coral depletion reduces COTS carrying capacity

4. Environmental Drivers:
   - Sea surface temperature affects COTS recruitment success
   - Larval immigration events trigger outbreaks
   - Temperature anomalies may stress corals, making them more vulnerable

OUTBREAK MECHANISMS:
- Outbreaks initiated by: (1) larval immigration pulses, (2) favorable temperature conditions for recruitment, (3) sufficient coral food availability
- Outbreaks sustained by: positive feedback between COTS abundance and successful recruitment (Allee effect reversal at high density)
- Outbreaks terminated by: coral depletion reducing carrying capacity, density-dependent mortality

MODEL STRUCTURE:
- State variables: COTS abundance, fast-growing coral cover, slow-growing coral cover
- Forcing variables: sea surface temperature, larval immigration rate
- Time step: annual
- Captures multi-decadal dynamics including multiple outbreak cycles
