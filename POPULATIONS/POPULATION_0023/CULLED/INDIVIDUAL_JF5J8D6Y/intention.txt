MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current model captures COTS-coral dynamics with Allee effects, temperature-dependent recruitment, and Type II functional responses for predation. However, it lacks a critical mechanism for episodic outbreak initiation.

KEY ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
Literature on Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks emphasizes that nutrient pulses (from terrestrial runoff, flood events, upwelling) are primary triggers for outbreak events by enhancing larval survival and recruitment success. The current model only includes temperature effects and immigration, missing this crucial resource-limitation mechanism.

PARAMETER EVIDENCE:
The updated log_mort_cots parameter (value=0.942, very tight bounds 0.939-0.944) indicates high baseline mortality (~2.57/year). This suggests populations would decline without strong recruitment pulses, reinforcing the need for explicit recruitment limitation/enhancement mechanisms.

PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT (AWAITING DATA):
Add nutrient-mediated larval survival to COTS recruitment using a Michaelis-Menten saturation function. This would provide:

1. MECHANISTIC OUTBREAK TRIGGER: Nutrient pulses drive episodic recruitment events
2. BOOM-BUST DYNAMICS: Strong recruitment during nutrient-rich periods, followed by decline as nutrients diminish and high mortality takes effect
3. SPATIAL/TEMPORAL PATCHINESS: Explains why outbreaks occur in specific locations/times based on nutrient availability
4. ECOLOGICAL REALISM: Saturating response reflects biological reality - extreme nutrient levels don't infinitely increase survival

MATHEMATICAL FORM (when data available):
nutrient_effect = nutrient_dat(t-1) / (half_sat_nutrient + nutrient_dat(t-1))

Where:
- nutrient_dat: Nutrient concentration data (requires new DATA_VECTOR)
- half_sat_nutrient: Half-saturation constant (requires new PARAMETER)
- Effect ranges from 0 (no nutrients) to 1 (saturating nutrients)

This would multiply the recruitment term, creating strong limitation at low nutrients and saturation at high nutrients.

INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING MECHANISMS:
The nutrient effect would work synergistically with:
- Allee effect: Still requires minimum population for successful reproduction
- Temperature effect: Optimal temperatures still needed for development
- Immigration: Can seed populations even when local recruitment is low

This would create a more complete picture where outbreaks require the confluence of: sufficient adult density (Allee), favorable temperatures, AND nutrient availability for larval survival.

CURRENT STATUS:
The nutrient mechanism is NOT currently implemented in model.cpp because nutrient data is not available in the dataset. The model currently runs with temperature and Allee effects only. Once nutrient data (nitrogen, phosphorus, or chlorophyll-a as proxy) becomes available, the mechanism can be activated by:
1. Adding nutrient_dat as DATA_VECTOR in model.cpp
2. Adding log_half_sat_nutrient as PARAMETER in model.cpp
3. Multiplying recruitment by nutrient_factor as shown above
4. Removing the nutrient_dat entry from parameters.json (since it would be data, not a parameter)
