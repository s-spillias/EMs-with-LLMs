MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model includes comprehensive COTS-coral dynamics with Allee effects, temperature-dependent recruitment, 
two coral functional groups (fast/slow growing), and Type II functional responses for predation.

ATTEMPTED IMPROVEMENT - NUTRIENT-MEDIATED LARVAL SURVIVAL:
Initially attempted to implement a nutrient-mediated larval survival mechanism using a Michaelis-Menten 
functional response to capture episodic outbreak triggers from phytoplankton blooms. However, the nutrient_dat 
forcing data is not currently available in the dataset.

CURRENT MODEL STATUS:
The nutrient mechanism has been temporarily disabled (nutrient effect set to constant 1.0) until nutrient 
forcing data becomes available. The model currently operates with:

1. COTS POPULATION DYNAMICS:
   - Logistic growth with dynamic carrying capacity based on coral availability
   - Allee effects reducing recruitment at low densities
   - Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response around optimal temperature)
   - Density-dependent mortality increasing at high densities
   - Larval immigration with constant survival efficiency

2. CORAL DYNAMICS:
   - Two functional groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites)
   - Logistic growth with interspecific competition
   - Type II functional response for COTS predation
   - Feeding preference for fast-growing corals

3. PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS:
   - Type II functional responses with handling time
   - Preferential feeding on fast-growing corals
   - Dynamic COTS carrying capacity linked to coral food availability

ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS PRESENT:
- Allee effects: Can create threshold dynamics where populations below critical density decline
- Temperature effects: Modulates recruitment success based on environmental conditions
- Density-dependent mortality: Provides negative feedback at high COTS densities
- Coral-mediated carrying capacity: Links COTS population size to food availability
- Differential predation: Captures selective feeding on coral types

LIMITATIONS WITHOUT NUTRIENT FORCING:
The model currently cannot capture episodic outbreak triggers from environmental pulses (e.g., flood events).
Outbreaks can still occur through:
- High larval immigration events (cotsimm_dat forcing)
- Favorable temperature conditions
- Release from Allee effects once threshold density is exceeded
- Abundant coral food availability

However, the nutrient-phytoplankton-larval survival pathway, which is a primary outbreak trigger in the 
Great Barrier Reef system, remains inactive until nutrient forcing data is provided.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:
When nutrient_dat becomes available, the model can be updated to include:
- Michaelis-Menten response: nutrient_effect = N / (K_N + N)
- Integration into larval recruitment: immigration * larval_survival_efficiency * nutrient_effect
- Parameters log_nutrient_half_sat to control sensitivity to nutrient pulses

This would enable the model to capture boom-bust cycles driven by episodic nutrient events coinciding 
with COTS spawning periods, as documented in COTS outbreak literature.

CURRENT MODEL STRENGTHS:
- Captures multiple density-dependent processes
- Includes environmental forcing (temperature, immigration)
- Represents coral community structure and differential predation
- Maintains numerical stability with appropriate bounds and constraints
- Uses ecologically realistic functional forms (Type II, Gaussian temperature response)

The model provides a solid foundation for COTS-coral dynamics and can be enhanced with nutrient forcing 
when data becomes available.
