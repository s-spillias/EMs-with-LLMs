MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements age-structured COTS dynamics with predator saturation (Type III functional response) as the primary outbreak mechanism. While theoretically sound, the model may not fully capture the persistence and duration of observed COTS outbreaks on the GBR.

KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:
The current predator saturation mechanism (Equation 2e) treats predator effectiveness as dependent only on juvenile COTS density. However, empirical evidence shows that COTS predators (giant triton Charonia tritonis, humphead wrasse Cheilinus undulatus, pufferfish) are themselves dependent on coral reef habitat quality. As coral cover declines during outbreaks, predator populations decline and their foraging efficiency decreases due to:
1. Loss of shelter and hunting grounds for predators
2. Reduced predator recruitment in degraded habitats
3. Behavioral changes in predators avoiding low-coral areas

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add a coral-mediated predator effectiveness modifier that scales the maximum predation rate based on total coral cover. This creates a critical positive feedback loop:

COTS outbreak → Coral consumption → Coral decline → Reduced predator effectiveness → Less predation control → COTS persist longer → Further coral decline

This feedback mechanism can explain:
- Why outbreaks persist for 2-3 years even after initial triggers (nutrients, temperature) subside
- Why recovery is slow - low coral means poor predation control on new recruits
- The characteristic "boom-bust" pattern where populations crash only after severe coral depletion

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Modify the maximum predation rate with a saturating function of total coral cover:

effective_max_predation = max_predation_rate * (total_coral^n / (K_predator_coral^n + total_coral^n))

Where:
- K_predator_coral = coral cover providing 50% of maximum predator effectiveness
- predator_coral_steepness (n) = Hill coefficient controlling response sharpness

This maintains the Type III functional response for density-dependent predation while adding coral-dependency that creates outbreak persistence.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Giant triton populations are strongly associated with high coral cover reefs
2. Humphead wrasse require complex coral structure for shelter and foraging
3. Empirical studies show predation pressure on COTS is 3-5x higher on healthy vs degraded reefs
4. This mechanism is parsimonious - adds only 2 parameters but creates emergent outbreak dynamics

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- More realistic outbreak duration (2-3 years vs potential rapid collapse)
- Hysteresis in recovery - even with low COTS, recovery is slow until coral rebuilds
- Better match to observed boom-bust cycles
- Explains why some reefs experience repeated outbreaks (degraded coral = poor predation control)
