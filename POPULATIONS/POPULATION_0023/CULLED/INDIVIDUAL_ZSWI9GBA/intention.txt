MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model includes several important mechanisms:
1. Age-structured COTS population (juveniles and adults)
2. Coral-dependent juvenile survival (max_juvenile_survival_boost = 0.7)
3. Temperature effects on recruitment (temp_opt = 28.5°C)
4. Nutrient-enhanced larval survival with outbreak threshold
5. Allee effects on adult reproduction
6. Type II functional response for coral predation

However, the model is missing a critical positive feedback mechanism needed to generate the characteristic COTS outbreak dynamics described in the PROJECT CONTEXT.

=== KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED ===

PROBLEM: The model cannot generate the rapid exponential growth phase characteristic of COTS outbreaks.

Current reproduction equation:
  adult_reproduction = r_cots * adult_curr * (1 - adult_curr/K_cots) * allee_effect * temp_effect

This produces gradual population changes, not the explosive outbreaks observed in nature.

ECOLOGICAL INSIGHT: 
Adult COTS fecundity is strongly dependent on food availability (coral). Well-fed adults on coral-rich reefs:
- Grow larger (up to 80cm diameter vs 25cm when starved)
- Produce 10-100x more gametes
- Have higher fertilization success
- Produce higher quality larvae

This creates a critical positive feedback:
  High coral → well-fed adults → high fecundity → more larvae → more juveniles → more adults → rapid coral depletion → population crash

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add CORAL-DEPENDENT ADULT FECUNDITY mechanism.

Mathematical form: Hill function (sigmoidal response)
  coral_fecundity_effect = (total_coral^hill_coefficient) / (total_coral^hill_coefficient + coral_half_sat_fecundity^hill_coefficient)

This multiplies the adult reproduction term, creating:

OUTBREAK PHASE (coral abundant):
- Fecundity near maximum
- Exponential population growth
- Rapid coral consumption

CRASH PHASE (coral depleted):
- Fecundity drops sharply below threshold
- Population decline accelerates
- Characteristic boom-bust cycle

=== PARAMETER JUSTIFICATION ===

1. log_coral_half_sat_fecundity (new):
   - Half-saturation for adult fecundity response to coral
   - Expected range: 15-40% coral cover
   - Lower than juvenile half-sat (currently 10%) because adults can sustain reproduction at lower coral levels
   - Initial value: 25% (exp(3.219))

2. hill_coefficient_fecundity (new):
   - Controls steepness of fecundity response
   - Hill coefficient > 1 creates sigmoidal (threshold) behavior
   - Range: 1.5-4.0
   - Higher values = sharper outbreak/crash transitions
   - Initial value: 2.5 (moderate cooperativity)

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

This improvement should:
1. Generate realistic boom-bust outbreak cycles
2. Create sharp transitions between outbreak and non-outbreak states
3. Produce population explosions when coral is abundant
4. Accelerate population crashes when coral is depleted
5. Better match the episodic outbreak patterns in the PROJECT CONTEXT

The mechanism is ecologically well-supported and mathematically parsimonious, adding only 2 parameters to capture a fundamental ecological process.

=== INTERACTION WITH EXISTING MECHANISMS ===

This complements existing mechanisms:
- Juvenile survival feedback (already strong at 0.7 boost) now paired with adult fecundity feedback
- Creates dual positive feedbacks at different life stages
- Temperature and nutrient effects still modulate recruitment
- Allee effects still prevent outbreaks at very low densities
- Together these create the complex outbreak dynamics observed in nature
