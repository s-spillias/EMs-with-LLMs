MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model has a sophisticated structure with age-structured COTS dynamics, coral refuge effects, temperature responses, and nutrient-driven outbreak mechanisms. However, nutrient forcing data (nutrient_dat) is not available in the dataset, so the nutrient outbreak mechanism uses a constant baseline value.

For a model focused on "episodic outbreaks" and "boom-bust cycles" of COTS on the GBR, the key challenge is capturing outbreak dynamics with the available forcing variables (temperature and larval immigration).

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:
ADDED DENSITY-DEPENDENT SETTLEMENT: Introduced a new parameter 'log_settlement_capacity' that limits larval settlement at high juvenile densities. This represents:
   - Space limitation on suitable settlement substrate
   - Intraspecific competition among settling larvae
   - Reduced settlement success when existing juveniles occupy prime habitat

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
The settlement capacity mechanism prevents unrealistic unlimited recruitment and creates more realistic boom-bust cycles. During outbreaks, high juvenile densities reduce further settlement efficiency, contributing to the eventual population decline as adult mortality and coral depletion take effect.

This is a critical negative feedback that operates during the outbreak phase:
- As juveniles accumulate from high larval supply, available settlement space becomes limiting
- New larvae face increased competition for suitable substrate
- Settlement efficiency declines hyperbolically with juvenile density
- This self-limiting mechanism helps terminate outbreaks even when larval supply remains high

The mechanism is particularly important for COTS because:
1. Juveniles require specific microhabitat (coral rubble, cryptic spaces)
2. High juvenile densities can saturate available settlement habitat
3. Intraspecific interference among settling larvae is documented
4. This creates realistic boom-bust dynamics without requiring explicit nutrient forcing

MATHEMATICAL FORM:
Settlement efficiency = K_settlement / (K_settlement + juvenile_density)

This creates a saturating response where settlement is efficient at low densities but decreases hyperbolically as juveniles accumulate, representing competition for settlement space.

EXPECTED IMPACT:
- More realistic boom-bust cycles with self-limiting outbreak dynamics
- Prevention of unrealistic runaway population growth during high immigration periods
- Better capture of outbreak termination mechanisms
- More ecologically realistic population regulation during outbreak peaks
- Improved model stability and biological realism

NOTE ON NUTRIENT FORCING:
While nutrient forcing would be ideal for capturing outbreak triggers (flood events → phytoplankton blooms → larval survival), the current dataset does not include nutrient_dat. The model retains nutrient response parameters for potential future use if nutrient data becomes available, but currently uses a constant baseline value (nutrient_curr = 1.0). The density-dependent settlement mechanism provides an alternative population regulation pathway that improves outbreak realism.
