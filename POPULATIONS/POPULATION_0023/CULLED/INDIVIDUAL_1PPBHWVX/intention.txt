MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Implements Allee effect for low-density recruitment limitation
- Includes temperature effects on both COTS recruitment and coral growth
- Type II functional response captures saturation in predation
- Density-dependent processes for both COTS and coral

Weaknesses identified:
1. Immigration effect is overly simplistic - linear boost doesn't capture threshold dynamics
2. Density-dependent mortality coefficient has zero bounds, effectively disabling this mechanism
3. No explicit larval settlement stage - immigration treated as direct adult addition
4. Missing synergistic interaction between immigration and local density near Allee threshold

Performance issues (based on ecological expectations):
- Outbreak timing likely too gradual without threshold-based immigration trigger
- Boom-bust cycles may lack the characteristic rapid onset seen in real outbreaks
- Recovery dynamics may be unrealistic without proper density-dependent mortality

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Ecological Rationale:
Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks are characterized by rapid transitions from low endemic densities 
(<0.01 individuals/m²) to outbreak levels (>0.5 individuals/m²). This explosive growth requires
both local recruitment AND larval immigration to overcome the Allee threshold. Current linear
immigration boost fails to capture this synergistic effect.

Key insight from COTS ecology:
- Immigration pulses are most effective when local populations are "primed" (near but below Allee threshold)
- Below threshold: immigration larvae face high mortality, minimal population boost
- Near threshold: immigration + local reproduction create positive feedback → outbreak
- Above threshold: local dynamics dominate, immigration less critical

Mathematical Implementation:
Replace linear immigration boost with threshold-sensitive function:

immigration_trigger = immigration_effect * immigration_prev * 
                      sigmoid((cots_prev - allee_threshold) / threshold_sensitivity)

Where:
- sigmoid creates smooth transition from low to high immigration effectiveness
- threshold_sensitivity controls steepness of transition (new parameter)
- Maximum effect occurs when local density ≈ Allee threshold
- Minimal effect when far below or above threshold

This captures:
1. Outbreak TIMING: Immigration most effective at critical density window
2. Outbreak MAGNITUDE: Synergistic boost creates rapid population explosion
3. Outbreak DURATION: Once above threshold, local dynamics sustain outbreak until coral depletion

Additional fix:
- Enable density-dependent mortality by setting appropriate bounds for log_mort_density_coef
- This allows disease/crowding effects at high densities, contributing to outbreak collapse

Expected improvements:
- Sharper outbreak onset matching observed dynamics
- More realistic boom-bust periodicity
- Better capture of the "trigger" nature of immigration pulses
- Improved prediction of outbreak timing relative to environmental conditions

=== PARAMETER CHANGES ===

New parameter:
- threshold_sensitivity: Controls how sharply immigration effectiveness changes near Allee threshold
  Range: 0.1 to 2.0 (log scale: -2.3 to 0.7)
  Lower values = gradual transition, Higher values = sharp threshold

Modified parameter:
- log_mort_density_coef: Enable density-dependent mortality
  New bounds: -4.6 to 0.0 (corresponding to 0.01 to 1.0 on natural scale)
  Ecological justification: Disease outbreaks documented at high COTS densities

=== EQUATION MODIFICATIONS ===

Old equation (linear immigration boost):
immigration_boost = 1.0 + immigration_effect * immigration_prev

New equation (threshold-sensitive immigration trigger):
density_relative_to_threshold = (cots_prev - allee_threshold) / (allee_threshold + eps)
immigration_sensitivity = 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-threshold_sensitivity * density_relative_to_threshold))
immigration_trigger = 1.0 + immigration_effect * immigration_prev * immigration_sensitivity

This maintains backward compatibility (when threshold_sensitivity → 0, reverts to density-independent)
while adding critical outbreak triggering dynamics.
