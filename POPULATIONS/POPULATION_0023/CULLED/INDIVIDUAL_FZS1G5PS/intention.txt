ECOLOGICAL MODEL INTENTION: Crown-of-Thorns Starfish Outbreak Dynamics

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, capturing characteristic boom-bust cycles and their impacts on coral communities.

KEY ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (critical for outbreak initiation)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival (warm years enhance recruitment)
   - External larval immigration events (connectivity between reefs)
   - Density-dependent mortality at high densities (resource limitation, disease)
   - Natural background mortality

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Two functional groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites)
   - Logistic growth with carrying capacity
   - Differential recovery rates reflecting life history strategies
   - Competition for space between coral groups

3. COTS-Coral Interactions:
   - Type II functional response for coral consumption (handling time limits feeding)
   - Preferential feeding on fast-growing Acropora when abundant
   - Switch to slow-growing corals when preferred prey depleted
   - Coral availability affects COTS survival and reproduction

4. Environmental Drivers:
   - Sea surface temperature affects larval survival and recruitment success
   - Temperature anomalies can trigger outbreak conditions
   - Larval immigration pulses represent connectivity effects

OUTBREAK MECHANISMS:
- Outbreaks initiated by: (1) favorable temperature conditions, (2) larval immigration, (3) sufficient coral food availability
- Sustained by: positive feedback between COTS abundance and recruitment success (Allee effect reversal)
- Terminated by: coral depletion, density-dependent mortality, unfavorable environmental conditions

The model predicts COTS abundance and coral cover over time, capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events while tracking impacts on coral community structure.
