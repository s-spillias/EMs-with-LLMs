MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model implements a mechanistically rich representation of COTS-coral dynamics including:
- Allee effects for outbreak triggering at low densities
- Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response around optimal SST)
- Selective predation with Type II functional responses and feeding preferences
- Non-linear density-dependent mortality (linear + quadratic terms) for boom-bust dynamics
- Dynamic carrying capacity linked to coral food availability
- Competition between fast and slow-growing coral guilds

MODEL FIT ASSESSMENT (from residuals):
--------------------------------------
COTS predictions:
- Large positive residuals during outbreak periods (observed > predicted by up to 0.35)
- Model systematically underpredicts outbreak magnitude
- Missing the rapid population explosions characteristic of COTS outbreaks

Fast coral predictions:
- Moderate fit with residuals in -0.1 to +0.1 range
- Slight tendency to overpredict in later periods

Slow coral predictions:
- Excellent fit with residuals in -0.05 to +0.05 range
- Model captures slow coral dynamics well

CRITICAL LIMITATION IDENTIFIED:
-------------------------------
The model fails to capture the MAGNITUDE of COTS outbreak events. Residuals show the model consistently underpredicts COTS abundance during outbreak periods, missing the characteristic rapid population explosions.

Root causes:
1. Current Allee effect formulation may be too weak to generate sufficient positive feedback
2. Missing time-lagged recruitment facilitation mechanisms
3. Lack of environmental forcing for episodic recruitment pulses

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
--------------------
Add a RECRUITMENT MEMORY EFFECT to enhance boom dynamics through time-lagged density dependence.

Ecological justification:
1. Successful recruitment in year t-1 facilitates recruitment in year t through:
   - Aggregation effects improving fertilization success (more adults = more gametes = higher fertilization rates)
   - Synchronized spawning events triggered by chemical cues from conspecifics
   - Swamping of larval predators when recruitment is high
   - Positive feedback in settlement cues (larvae prefer to settle near adults)

2. This creates a "recruitment memory" where high adult density in previous year(s) enhances current recruitment success beyond what the instantaneous Allee effect captures

3. Provides a data-driven mechanism to boost outbreak magnitude without requiring additional environmental forcing data

Mathematical implementation:
- Add parameter: log_recruitment_memory_strength (controls strength of lagged effect)
- Modify recruitment equation to include:
  recruitment_memory_effect = 1 + recruitment_memory_strength * (cots_prev / (K_cots + cots_prev))
- This multiplies the recruitment term, creating stronger positive feedback during outbreak initiation
- The effect is based on previous time step density, creating temporal autocorrelation in recruitment success

Expected outcomes:
1. Larger recruitment pulses during outbreak initiation (addressing positive residuals)
2. More realistic boom dynamics with rapid population growth
3. Better match to observed outbreak magnitudes
4. Maintains bust dynamics through existing density-dependent mortality

Parameter additions:
- log_recruitment_memory_strength: strength of lagged density effect on recruitment (dimensionless)
  * Lower bound: -2.303 (0.1x effect, minimal memory)
  * Upper bound: 1.609 (5x effect, strong memory)
  * Initial value: 0.0 (1x, neutral starting point)

Implementation notes:
- Uses only previous time step data (cots_pred(t)), avoiding data leakage
- Combines with existing Allee effect (multiplicative)
- Saturating function prevents unrealistic recruitment explosions
- Can be calibrated to match observed outbreak magnitudes from residuals

JUSTIFICATION FOR CHOSEN APPROACH:
----------------------------------
The recruitment memory effect addresses the specific model weakness revealed by residuals (underprediction of outbreak magnitude) while:
1. Using only existing data (no new data requirements)
2. Adding ecological realism (well-documented aggregation and synchronization effects)
3. Maintaining model parsimony (only 1 new parameter)
4. Preserving existing mechanisms (works alongside Allee effects and density-dependent mortality)
5. Providing improved outbreak dynamics without requiring environmental forcing data
