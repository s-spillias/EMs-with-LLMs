MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model captures key COTS outbreak dynamics including:
- Age-structured population (juveniles and adults)
- Allee effects limiting reproduction at low adult densities
- Temperature-dependent recruitment
- Coral-dependent juvenile survival (recently added)
- Nutrient-driven larval survival with outbreak threshold
- Selective feeding on fast vs slow-growing coral

However, the model lacks a critical self-limiting mechanism for juvenile COTS during outbreak conditions.

KEY MISSING PROCESS: Density-Dependent Juvenile Mortality

ECOLOGICAL PROBLEM:
The current juvenile mortality equation is:
  m_cots_juvenile_effective = m_cots_juvenile * (1 - max_juvenile_survival_boost * coral_survival_effect)

This creates a positive feedback loop:
1. High coral → low juvenile mortality → more juveniles survive
2. More juveniles → more adults → more coral consumption
3. But there's NO negative feedback from high juvenile density itself

During real COTS outbreaks, juveniles experience:
- Intense competition for settling space on the reef
- Interference competition during feeding
- Cannibalism at high densities
- Resource depletion in localized areas

Without density-dependent juvenile mortality, the model can produce unrealistic juvenile accumulation during outbreaks, especially when coral is abundant (which paradoxically reduces juvenile mortality in the current formulation).

PROPOSED SOLUTION: Add Intraspecific Competition Term for Juveniles

Add a density-dependent mortality component that increases with juvenile density:
  
  density_effect_juvenile = juvenile_curr / (juvenile_half_sat + juvenile_curr)
  m_cots_juvenile_effective = m_cots_juvenile * (1 - max_juvenile_survival_boost * coral_survival_effect) * 
                              (1 + dd_juvenile_mortality_strength * density_effect_juvenile)

This creates:
1. Baseline mortality modulated by coral availability (existing mechanism)
2. Additional mortality that increases with juvenile density (new mechanism)
3. Realistic self-limitation during outbreaks

MATHEMATICAL FORM:
- Michaelis-Menten saturation for density effect (0 to 1 scale)
- Multiplier on mortality: (1 + strength * effect)
- At low density: minimal additional mortality
- At high density: substantial additional mortality
- Half-saturation constant determines density threshold for self-limitation

ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS:
1. Prevents unrealistic juvenile accumulation during outbreaks
2. Creates more realistic boom-bust dynamics with natural population regulation
3. Maintains coral-dependent survival but adds density-dependent brake
4. Allows outbreaks to occur but limits their maximum intensity
5. More accurately captures the self-limiting nature of real COTS outbreaks

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- log_juvenile_half_sat: Half-saturation density for juvenile self-limitation (individuals/m2)
  Range: 0.1-10 individuals/m2 (log scale: -2.303 to 2.303)
  
- dd_juvenile_mortality_strength: Strength of density-dependent mortality multiplier
  Range: 0.5-5.0 (dimensionless)
  Higher values = stronger self-limitation at high densities

This improvement addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT goal of "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" by adding a realistic self-limiting mechanism that controls outbreak intensity and duration.
