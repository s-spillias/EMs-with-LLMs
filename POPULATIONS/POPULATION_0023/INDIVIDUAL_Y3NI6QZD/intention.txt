MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model includes age-structured COTS dynamics (juveniles and adults), two coral functional groups, and environmental forcing through temperature, larval immigration, and nutrients. Key mechanisms include:
- Allee effects on adult reproduction
- Temperature-dependent recruitment
- Nutrient-enhanced larval survival with outbreak threshold
- Type II functional responses for coral consumption
- Coral-limited adult carrying capacity

IDENTIFIED GAP - CORAL-DEPENDENT JUVENILE SURVIVAL:
The current model has a critical missing mechanism for capturing sustained COTS outbreaks: juvenile survival is independent of coral availability. In reality, juvenile COTS (age 0-2 years) require abundant coral for:
1. Settlement substrate
2. Food during critical early growth phase
3. Refuge from predators in complex coral structure

This creates a positive feedback loop essential for outbreak dynamics:
- High coral → High juvenile survival → More adults → More larvae → More juveniles (if coral remains high)
- Low coral → Low juvenile survival → Fewer adults → Population crash

Currently, only adults experience coral-limited carrying capacity through K_cots, but the juvenile stage is where coral availability most strongly affects population growth during outbreaks.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add a coral-dependent juvenile survival mechanism using a Michaelis-Menten functional form that modulates juvenile mortality based on total coral cover.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. OUTBREAK INITIATION: When coral cover is high (post-disturbance recovery), juvenile survival is maximized, allowing rapid population growth from immigration pulses
2. OUTBREAK SUSTENANCE: Abundant coral maintains high juvenile survival even as adult density increases, sustaining the outbreak
3. BOOM-BUST TRANSITION: As COTS consume coral, juvenile survival declines, reducing recruitment to the adult stage and triggering population collapse
4. REALISTIC DYNAMICS: This mechanism captures the observed pattern where outbreaks persist for 2-4 years then crash, rather than reaching equilibrium

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Add parameter: log_coral_half_sat_juvenile (log half-saturation constant for coral effect on juvenile survival)
- Add parameter: max_juvenile_survival_boost (maximum reduction in juvenile mortality when coral is abundant, range 0-0.9)
- Modify juvenile mortality: m_cots_juvenile_effective = m_cots_juvenile * (1 - max_juvenile_survival_boost * (total_coral / (total_coral + coral_half_sat_juvenile)))
- This creates a saturating response where:
  * High coral → Low effective juvenile mortality (high survival)
  * Low coral → High effective juvenile mortality (low survival)
  * Half-saturation determines the coral level giving 50% of maximum survival boost

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
1. More realistic outbreak dynamics with rapid growth phase
2. Better capture of boom-bust cycles
3. Improved timing of population crashes as coral depletes
4. Stronger coupling between COTS and coral dynamics
5. Emergent threshold behavior where outbreaks only occur when coral exceeds critical levels

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding a crucial ecological mechanism that directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT of capturing episodic outbreak dynamics.
