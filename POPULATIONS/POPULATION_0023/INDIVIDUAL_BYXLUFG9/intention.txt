MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements age-structured COTS dynamics with juveniles and adults, coral refuge effects on juvenile mortality, temperature effects on recruitment, Allee effects, and a sophisticated two-component nutrient response system. The nutrient forcing infrastructure is in place but currently uses a constant value (nutrient_curr = 1.0) because nutrient_dat is not yet available in the data source.

IDENTIFIED ISSUE:
The nutrient forcing data (nutrient_dat) is not currently available in the dataset. While the model has the complete infrastructure to respond to nutrient variation—including Michaelis-Menten baseline response, outbreak threshold detection, and sigmoid boost—it cannot be activated until nutrient data becomes available.

ECOLOGICAL CONTEXT:
Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks are strongly linked to nutrient enrichment from terrestrial runoff, particularly following flood events. Elevated nutrients promote phytoplankton blooms that dramatically increase larval survival during the planktonic phase. This creates episodic recruitment pulses that trigger population explosions. The model is designed to capture these dynamics but requires nutrient forcing data to function properly.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
The model uses nutrient_curr = Type(1.0) as a placeholder constant. This means:
1. The nutrient response mechanism is mathematically functional but produces constant output
2. All nutrient-related parameters (half-saturation, outbreak threshold, multiplier, steepness) are present but have no effect on dynamics
3. The model can still fit data through other mechanisms (temperature, Allee effects, coral refuge)
4. When nutrient_dat becomes available, only one line needs to change: nutrient_curr = nutrient_dat(t)

NUTRIENT RESPONSE MECHANISM (READY BUT INACTIVE):
The two-component nutrient response includes:
- Baseline Michaelis-Menten response: nutrient_baseline = nutrient / (nutrient + half_sat)
- Threshold-triggered outbreak boost: outbreak_boost = multiplier / (1 + exp(-steepness * (nutrient - threshold)))
- Combined effect: nutrient_effect = baseline * (1 + outbreak_boost)
- Applied to larval recruitment: immigration * efficiency * nutrient_effect

EXPECTED OUTCOMES WHEN NUTRIENT DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE:
- Larval recruitment will vary with environmental nutrient conditions
- Outbreak events will be triggered by nutrient pulses above the threshold
- Population dynamics will show realistic boom-bust cycles
- Model predictions should better match observed outbreak timing and magnitude
- The characteristic episodic nature of COTS outbreaks will emerge from environmental forcing

NEXT STEPS:
Once nutrient_dat is added to the data source, change line in model.cpp from:
  Type nutrient_curr = Type(1.0);
to:
  Type nutrient_curr = nutrient_dat(t);

This single change will activate the full nutrient-driven outbreak mechanism without requiring any other modifications to the model structure or parameters.
