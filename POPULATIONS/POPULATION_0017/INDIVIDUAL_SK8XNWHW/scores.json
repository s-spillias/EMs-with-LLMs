  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth -> grazing -> zooplankton growth & loss) but with several formulation differences vs the TRUTH Python model. Uptake/growth are written as Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light-limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert mixed-layer average) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b+cP)) form. Grazing is Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form. Recycling is present but partitioned differently (unassimilated grazing + mortality recycling). The candidate omits the TRUTH environmental mixing/dilution term for nutrients and for phytoplankton, and it replaces TRUTH linear zooplankton mortality with quadratic mortality. Overall, most canonical roles are present but several are alternate formulations and two TRUTH terms (nutrient mixing and P mixing) are missing.",
