  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling from mortality and unassimilated grazing) but uses different mathematical choices and adds several processes not present in the TRUTH script. Uptake/growth are implemented as Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light\u2011limitation term (avg_light/(K_I+avg_light)) rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) factor. Grazing is a standard Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) in the candidate (an alternate to the TRUTH\u2019s P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). The candidate also includes temperature (Q10) scaling, explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation and mixed-layer averaging, a variable assimilation efficiency (food quality \u00d7 satiation), and quadratic aggregation and zooplankton mortality terms. Important omissions relative to TRUTH: no explicit mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) appears, and no explicit physical mixing loss for P or Z. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but with alternates for several canonical terms and with added processes (temperature scaling, explicit light, variable assimilation, sinking recycling fraction).",
