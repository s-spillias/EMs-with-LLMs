MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current NPZ model implements standard ecological processes (Monod growth, Holling Type II grazing, linear mortality, nutrient recycling). The phytoplankton growth rate parameter (r) has been updated from literature with value 1.0 day^-1 and bounds [0.8, 1.2], indicating good empirical support.

KEY LIMITATION IDENTIFIED:
The model uses linear mortality for zooplankton (m_Z * Z), which is ecologically unrealistic for marine systems. In natural plankton communities, zooplankton mortality typically shows density-dependence due to:
1. Higher trophic level predation (fish, jellyfish) that increases with prey density
2. Cannibalism in copepods and other zooplankton
3. Disease transmission that scales with population density
4. Increased encounter rates with visual predators at higher densities

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
Added density-dependent (quadratic) mortality term for zooplankton to represent implicit higher trophic level control and intraspecific interactions.

New mortality formulation: m_Z * Z + m_Z2 * Z²

Where:
- m_Z: linear (baseline) mortality rate (day^-1)
- m_Z2: quadratic (density-dependent) mortality coefficient (day^-1 * (g C m^-3)^-1)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Quadratic mortality is well-documented in marine ecosystems (Steele & Henderson 1992, Edwards & Yool 2000)
2. Represents closure term for higher trophic levels without explicitly modeling them
3. Prevents unrealistic zooplankton blooms that can occur with linear mortality alone
4. Creates more realistic predator-prey dynamics and oscillations
5. The Z² term naturally increases mortality pressure as zooplankton density increases

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- More stable population dynamics
- Prevention of unrealistic zooplankton accumulation
- Better representation of top-down control in the food web
- Improved model fit if data shows density-dependent patterns in zooplankton decline

PARAMETER BOUNDS:
The new parameter m_Z2 should be small (typically 0.01-0.1 range) as it acts on squared biomass. Lower bound of 0.0 ensures non-negative mortality contribution. Upper bound prevents excessive mortality that would eliminate zooplankton unrealistically.
