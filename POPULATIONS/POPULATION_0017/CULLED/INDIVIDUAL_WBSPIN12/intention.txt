MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system with:
- Nutrient limitation (Michaelis-Menten kinetics)
- Light limitation with self-shading (Beer-Lambert law)
- Zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II functional response)
- Mixed linear-quadratic phytoplankton mortality
- Nutrient recycling pathways

The model includes sophisticated features like density-dependent mortality and light attenuation by phytoplankton biomass.

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The current light limitation formulation uses simple Michaelis-Menten saturation:
  light_limitation = I / (K_I + I)

This approach only captures light limitation at low intensities but misses a critical ecological phenomenon: PHOTOINHIBITION. At high light intensities (especially near the ocean surface or in shallow mixed layers), phytoplankton experience photodamage to photosystem II, leading to reduced photosynthetic rates and growth. This is particularly important for:
1. Surface blooms where cells experience high irradiance
2. Shallow mixed layers (z_mix < 20m)
3. Clear water conditions (low k_w)
4. Low phytoplankton biomass (minimal self-shading)

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Replace the simple Michaelis-Menten light limitation with a Steele (1962) photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curve that includes photoinhibition:

  light_limitation = (I / I_opt) * exp(1 - I / I_opt)

Where:
- I is the average light intensity in the mixed layer
- I_opt is the optimal light intensity for maximum photosynthesis
- The exponential term creates photoinhibition at I > I_opt

This formulation:
- Increases from 0 as light increases (light limitation)
- Peaks at I = I_opt (optimal growth)
- Decreases as light exceeds I_opt (photoinhibition)
- Is mathematically smooth and differentiable (good for optimization)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Photoinhibition is well-documented in marine phytoplankton (Platt et al. 1980, Eilers & Peeters 1988)
2. Can explain reduced productivity in surface waters despite high light
3. Creates more realistic vertical integration of production in mixed layer
4. Particularly relevant for diatom blooms and high-light adapted species
5. Affects bloom dynamics and succession patterns

PARAMETER CHANGES:
- REMOVE: K_I (half-saturation for light, no longer needed)
- ADD: I_opt (optimal light intensity for photosynthesis)
  * Units: W m^-2
  * Typical range: 50-150 W m^-2 for marine phytoplankton
  * Initial value: 80 W m^-2 (mid-range for mixed phytoplankton assemblages)
  * Lower bound: 30 W m^-2 (shade-adapted species)
  * Upper bound: 200 W m^-2 (high-light adapted species)

EXPECTED IMPACTS:
1. More realistic response to high surface irradiance
2. Better representation of depth-integrated production
3. Potential for different bloom dynamics under varying light conditions
4. More accurate simulation of seasonal cycles with varying solar radiation
5. Better fit to data if photoinhibition is occurring in the observations

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
The Steele curve is computationally efficient and has been widely validated in ocean biogeochemical models (NPZD models, ecosystem models like ERSEM, PISCES, etc.). It provides a good balance between ecological realism and mathematical tractability.
