  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth, grazing -> zooplankton growth, mortality -> recycling) but uses different functional forms in several places. Key differences: uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten in N combined with an explicit light limitation (Steele photoinhibition with Beer\u2013Lambert self-shading) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) algebraic form; grazing is Holling type II (g_max*P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional; mortality closures include quadratic terms not present in TRUTH. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present for nutrients and phytoplankton in the TRUTH model. Overall the candidate matches canonical ecological roles but several components are ALTERNATE formulations and two TRUTH terms (nutrient and phytoplankton mixing) are missing.",
