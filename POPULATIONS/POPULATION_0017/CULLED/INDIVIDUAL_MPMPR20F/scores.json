  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but uses different functional forms for several processes compared with the TRUTH model. Uptake and grazing are implemented as simple Monod (Michaelis-Menten) and Holling Type II functions respectively (alternate formulations relative to TRUTH's two-factor uptake and P^2-based grazing). Recycling from grazing and mortality is present in the candidate (excretion + mortality recycling), but the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P) is missing for nutrients and phytoplankton in the candidate. Zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) in the candidate, whereas TRUTH uses linear zooplankton mortality. The candidate also includes modeling/estimation machinery (soft parameter penalties, observation likelihood, forward Euler integration) that are not ecological processes.",
