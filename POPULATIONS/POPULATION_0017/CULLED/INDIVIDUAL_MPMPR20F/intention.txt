NPZ Plankton Population Model

This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton ecosystem in the oceanic mixed layer, tracking three key components:

1. Nutrient (N): Dissolved inorganic nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) available for phytoplankton uptake
2. Phytoplankton (P): Primary producers that convert nutrients into biomass through photosynthesis
3. Zooplankton (Z): Herbivorous grazers that consume phytoplankton

Key Ecological Processes:
- Phytoplankton growth is limited by nutrient availability following Michaelis-Menten (Type II functional response) kinetics
- Zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton follows a Holling Type II functional response with saturation
- Nutrient recycling occurs through phytoplankton mortality and zooplankton excretion
- Phytoplankton experience natural mortality (e.g., viral lysis, senescence)
- Zooplankton experience density-dependent mortality

The model captures the classic predator-prey-resource dynamics that can lead to oscillations in plankton populations, which are commonly observed in marine ecosystems. Nutrients are recycled back into the system through decomposition and excretion, creating a closed nutrient cycle typical of oligotrophic ocean regions.

This formulation is based on the classic NPZ models used in biological oceanography to understand plankton bloom dynamics, seasonal cycles, and the biological pump in ocean biogeochemistry.
