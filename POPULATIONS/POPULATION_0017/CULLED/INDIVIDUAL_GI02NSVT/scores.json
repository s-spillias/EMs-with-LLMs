  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with the standard ecological roles (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-mediated transfer to zooplankton, recycling from mortalities and unassimilated grazing, and linear mortalities). However the functional forms differ from the TRUTH in several places: the candidate uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) nutrient limitation (r * N/(K_N+N)) and a Holling type II grazing (g_max * P/(K_P+P)), while the TRUTH uses a multiplicative N/(e+N) times a light-related term a/(b + c P) and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing function. The candidate is implemented as a discrete-time forward update (fluxes multiplied by dt) rather than continuous ODEs and it omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in the TRUTH (k*(N0-N) in N and mixing in P). Recycling to nutrients is present via mortality and unassimilated grazing in the candidate. Overall: canonical roles present, but some functional forms are alternates; mixing is missing.",
