NPZ Plankton Ecosystem Model

This model simulates the coupled dynamics of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z) in the oceanic mixed layer. The model captures three key ecological processes:

1. NUTRIENT UPTAKE AND PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH: Phytoplankton take up dissolved nutrients from the water column to support photosynthetic growth. Nutrient uptake follows Michaelis-Menten (Monod) kinetics, representing the saturating relationship between nutrient availability and growth rate. The maximum growth rate is modulated by nutrient concentration, with half-saturation constant determining the nutrient level at which growth is half-maximal.

2. GRAZING AND ZOOPLANKTON GROWTH: Zooplankton consume phytoplankton following a Type II functional response (Holling disc equation), which accounts for handling time and saturation at high prey densities. Only a fraction of consumed phytoplankton biomass is converted to zooplankton biomass (assimilation efficiency), with the remainder lost to respiration and excretion.

3. MORTALITY AND NUTRIENT RECYCLING: Both phytoplankton and zooplankton experience density-independent mortality. Phytoplankton mortality returns nutrients directly to the dissolved pool, while zooplankton mortality also contributes to nutrient regeneration. This creates a feedback loop where nutrients are recycled through the food web.

The model represents a closed system where total carbon is conserved through the cycling between dissolved nutrients and living biomass. Initial conditions are set from observed data, and the model predicts the temporal evolution of all three state variables using a discrete-time approximation with daily time steps.
