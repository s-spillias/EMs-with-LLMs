  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ dynamical model and reproduces many canonical ecological roles from the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from grazers, phytoplankton growth and grazing losses, zooplankton growth via assimilation, zooplankton mortality). However, the candidate departs from the TRUTH model in functional forms (uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit light-limitation term, Holling type II grazing, quadratic aggregation, and food-dependent + quadratic zooplankton mortality) and omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) in nutrients and linear mixing loss for P and Z). The candidate also adds several processes not in TRUTH (temperature/Q10 scaling, explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light averaging with self-shading, starvation mortality, detailed partitioning of grazing outputs, recycling fractions xi and delta, and quadratic aggregation/zooplankton mortality). Overall many ecological roles are present but several are implemented as alternates to TRUTH and mixing terms are missing.",
