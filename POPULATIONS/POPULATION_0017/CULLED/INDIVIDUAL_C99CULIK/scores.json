  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the main ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) but uses different functional forms from the TRUTH NPZ. Uptake is implemented as Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light limitation (mixed-layer averaging) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * (a/(b+c*P)) * P form. Grazing is Holling Type II instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH (e.g. k*(N0 - N) and -(s+k)*P). The candidate adds an explicit light attenuation / mixed-layer averaging formulation and an explicit quadratic phytoplankton mortality term (density-dependent), which are not in the TRUTH equations.",
