  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a fully dynamical NPZ with the same high-level structure (N, P, Z compartments and uptake \u2192 P growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 Z growth \u2192 recycling) but uses different mechanistic formulations and many additional processes. Uptake/growth are implemented as a product of a Monod nutrient term and an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert average light) and temperature Q10 scaling; grazing is Holling-type II rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (type-III\u2013like) form; mortality and aggregation use both linear and quadratic forms and include food-dependent starvation and quadratic density mortality for Z. The candidate therefore matches the TRUTH model conceptually for most roles but usually as an alternate functional family rather than exact matches. Several extra processes (Q10 temperature scaling, explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light + mixed-layer averaging, variable assimilation efficiency, food-dependent starvation mortality, density-dependent aggregation/mortality, explicit sinking-recycling parameter xi) appear that are not in the TRUTH code.",
