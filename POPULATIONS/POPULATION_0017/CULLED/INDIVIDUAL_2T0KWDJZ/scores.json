  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ dynamics model with the expected uptake, grazing, mortality and recycling roles, but it uses different mathematical choices versus the TRUTH reference. Uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term multiplied by explicit light limitation and a carrying-capacity (density) factor (an alternate co-limitation design). Grazing is Holling Type II (P/(K+P)) with a food-dependent assimilation efficiency; TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Hill-type) grazing and constant assimilation. The candidate includes many additional ecological modifiers not in TRUTH (temperature Q10 scaling, Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation with self-shading and mixed-layer averaging, an explicit carrying-capacity factor, quadratic aggregation/sinking with partial recycling, and quadratic zooplankton mortality). Critically, the candidate omits an explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term (TRUTH has k*(N0 - N)) and omits explicit physical mixing terms for P and Z. Many processes therefore match TRUTH only as alternates (not exact matches), while linear phytoplankton mortality is the one direct TRUTH match.",
