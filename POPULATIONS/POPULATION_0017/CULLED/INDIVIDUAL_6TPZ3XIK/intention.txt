MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current NPZ model captures basic trophic dynamics but lacks a critical limiting factor for phytoplankton: light availability. 

CURRENT STRENGTHS:
- Nutrient limitation via Michaelis-Menten kinetics (well-parameterized with r=1.0 from literature)
- Realistic grazing dynamics with Holling Type II functional response
- Nutrient recycling from mortality at both trophic levels
- Density-dependent zooplankton mortality

IDENTIFIED GAP:
Phytoplankton growth in oceanic mixed layers is co-limited by BOTH nutrients and light. The current model only considers nutrient limitation, which can lead to:
1. Overestimation of productivity in low-light conditions (deep mixing, winter, high turbidity)
2. Failure to capture spring bloom dynamics driven by light-nutrient interactions
3. Missing self-shading effects where high phytoplankton biomass reduces light penetration

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
Implemented light-nutrient co-limitation using a multiplicative model:
- Growth = r × f(nutrients) × f(light)
- Light availability follows Beer-Lambert law with self-shading
- Light limitation uses Monod/Michaelis-Menten form for consistency

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
1. I_0: Surface light intensity (W m^-2) - represents incoming photosynthetically active radiation
   - Typical range: 50-400 W m^-2 depending on season/latitude
   - Set to 200 W m^-2 as temperate ocean average
   
2. K_I: Half-saturation constant for light limitation (W m^-2)
   - Represents light level at which growth is half-maximal
   - Range: 20-100 W m^-2 based on phytoplankton physiology
   - Set to 50 W m^-2 as typical value
   
3. k_w: Background light attenuation coefficient (m^-1)
   - Attenuation by water and dissolved materials
   - Range: 0.02-0.2 m^-1 for clear to coastal waters
   - Set to 0.04 m^-1 for clear oceanic water
   
4. k_p: Specific light attenuation by phytoplankton (m^-1 (g C m^-3)^-1)
   - Self-shading effect - higher phytoplankton reduces light penetration
   - Range: 0.01-0.1 based on chlorophyll-specific attenuation
   - Set to 0.03 m^-1 (g C m^-3)^-1
   
5. z_mix: Mixed layer depth (m)
   - Depth over which phytoplankton are mixed and experience average light
   - Range: 10-100 m seasonally
   - Set to 30 m as typical summer value

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
Average light in mixed layer: I_avg = I_0 × (1 - exp(-(k_w + k_p×P)×z_mix)) / ((k_w + k_p×P)×z_mix)
Light limitation factor: f(I) = I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)
Modified growth: uptake = r × (N/(K_N + N)) × (I_avg/(K_I + I_avg)) × P

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
This modification is essential for realistic plankton dynamics because:
- Captures seasonal bloom patterns (winter: high N, low light → low growth; spring: increasing light → bloom)
- Represents self-shading feedback (bloom reduces its own light, contributing to termination)
- Maintains mathematical consistency with existing Michaelis-Menten framework
- Well-established in plankton ecology (e.g., Evans & Parslow 1985, Fasham et al. 1990)
- Adds minimal complexity (5 parameters) for substantial ecological realism

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- Better fit to seasonal data patterns
- More realistic bloom dynamics
- Improved prediction of productivity under varying light conditions
- Captures light-nutrient trade-offs in mixed layer dynamics
