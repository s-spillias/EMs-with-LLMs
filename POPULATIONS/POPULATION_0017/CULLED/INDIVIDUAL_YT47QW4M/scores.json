  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth; grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth; mortality and recycling) but uses different functional forms and adds explicit ecological processes absent from the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth are represented as Monod (Michaelis-Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit Beer\u2013Lambert light limitation and a temperature (Q10) scaling. Grazing is Holling Type II (Monod) rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(\u03bc^2+P^2) form, and zooplankton losses are split into quadratic mortality and a separate respiration term. The candidate lacks the explicit environmental mixing/dilution term present in TRUTH for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and also omits explicit mixing/entrainment terms for P and Z. Several extra components (explicit light attenuation/averaging, Q10 temperature scaling, explicit respiration/excretion and aggregation-sinking recycling) are present that are not in the TRUTH equations.",
