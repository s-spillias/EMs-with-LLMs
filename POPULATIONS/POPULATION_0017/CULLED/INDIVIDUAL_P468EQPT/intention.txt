MODEL ASSESSMENT:

Current Structure:
- NPZ model with nutrient recycling and light limitation
- Phytoplankton: Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake with light co-limitation (Beer-Lambert with self-shading)
- Zooplankton: Holling Type II grazing with quadratic (density-dependent) mortality
- Asymmetry: Linear phytoplankton mortality vs. quadratic zooplankton mortality

Identified Gap:
The model uses linear mortality for phytoplankton (m_P * P) but quadratic mortality for zooplankton (m_Z * Z²). 
This asymmetry may not adequately capture phytoplankton dynamics at high densities where:
1. Viral lysis rates increase with host density (frequency-dependent infection)
2. Intraspecific competition intensifies (crowding effects)
3. Aggregation and enhanced sinking occur at bloom densities
4. Self-toxicity from allelopathic compounds accumulates

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:

Add density-dependent phytoplankton mortality to create more realistic bloom dynamics.

Mathematical Change:
- OLD: P_mortality = m_P * P
- NEW: P_mortality = m_P * P + m_P2 * P²

Where:
- m_P: baseline linear mortality rate (day⁻¹)
- m_P2: density-dependent mortality coefficient (day⁻¹ (g C m⁻³)⁻¹)

Ecological Justification:
1. Viral dynamics: Lytic viruses spread more efficiently at higher host densities
2. Competition: Crowding effects reduce individual fitness beyond simple resource limitation
3. Aggregation: Dense blooms form aggregates that sink faster
4. Metabolite accumulation: Self-inhibitory compounds concentrate at high cell densities

Expected Outcomes:
- More realistic bloom termination mechanisms
- Better representation of stationary phase dynamics
- Improved model stability at high phytoplankton concentrations
- Structural symmetry with zooplankton mortality formulation
- Self-limiting growth that complements nutrient limitation

Parameter Addition:
- m_P2: New density-dependent phytoplankton mortality coefficient
- Initial value: 0.05 day⁻¹ (g C m⁻³)⁻¹
- Range: 0.01 - 0.2 day⁻¹ (g C m⁻³)⁻¹
- Lower than m_Z to reflect that phytoplankton density-dependence is typically weaker than zooplankton predation pressure
