  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake, phytoplankton growth and losses, zooplankton grazing and mortality, and recycling) but uses different functional forms for key processes compared to the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are multiplicative nutrient \u00d7 light limitation (Michaelis-Menten nutrient term combined with a separate saturating light term I/(K_I+I)) rather than the TRUTH's nutrient \u00d7 self-shading term a/(b + c*P). Grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) versus the TRUTH Holling Type III (\u221d P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). The candidate includes explicit recycling from mortality and unassimilated grazing, and adds quadratic density-dependent zooplankton mortality (an extra component). The candidate omits any explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms for N, P or Z that appear in the TRUTH (e.g., k*(N0 - N) and mixing losses on P). Numerical integration and likelihood elements are model-fitting machinery rather than ecological processes.",
