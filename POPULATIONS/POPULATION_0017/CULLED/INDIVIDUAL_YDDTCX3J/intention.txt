ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:

The current NPZ model implements core plankton dynamics with nutrient recycling, light limitation with self-shading, and density-dependent zooplankton mortality. The model structure is sound but lacks a critical environmental driver: temperature.

KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:
All biological rate processes (phytoplankton growth, zooplankton grazing, mortality rates) are temperature-dependent in real oceanic systems. Temperature varies seasonally in the mixed layer (typically 5-25°C depending on latitude and season) and fundamentally controls:
- Phytoplankton metabolic rates and growth
- Zooplankton feeding rates and metabolism  
- Microbial decomposition and nutrient recycling rates
- The timing and magnitude of spring/fall blooms

Without temperature dependence, the model cannot capture:
- Seasonal plankton succession patterns
- Spring bloom dynamics driven by warming + light increase
- Summer stratification effects on productivity
- Climate change impacts on plankton communities

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Temperature-Dependent Metabolic Rates

Add temperature as a time-varying environmental forcing variable and implement Q10-based temperature scaling for all biological rates:

1. Phytoplankton growth rate: r(T) = r_ref * Q10_r^((T - T_ref)/10)
2. Zooplankton grazing rate: g_max(T) = g_max_ref * Q10_g^((T - T_ref)/10)  
3. Phytoplankton mortality: m_P(T) = m_P_ref * Q10_mP^((T - T_ref)/10)
4. Zooplankton mortality: m_Z(T) = m_Z_ref * Q10_mZ^((T - T_ref)/10)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Q10 values of 1.5-2.5 for phytoplankton growth are well-established in literature
- Zooplankton grazing shows Q10 of 2-3 (higher temperature sensitivity than growth)
- Mortality rates increase with temperature due to higher metabolic costs
- Q10 formulation is simpler than Arrhenius but captures essential temperature effects
- Allows model to simulate seasonal dynamics and climate scenarios

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Add T_ref (reference temperature, typically 15°C for temperate oceans)
- Add Q10 parameters for each rate process (Q10_r, Q10_g, Q10_mP, Q10_mZ)
- Add Temperature as a data vector (time-varying forcing)
- Modify rate calculations to include temperature scaling
- All Q10 values constrained to biologically realistic ranges (1.0-4.0)

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding critical environmental realism needed to capture plankton dynamics across seasons and climate conditions.
