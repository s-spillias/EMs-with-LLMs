  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the same three-state NPZ structure but uses alternate mathematical forms for several processes. Uptake/growth are multiplicative nutrient Michaelis\u2013Menten \u00d7 light limitation (here via Beer\u2013Lambert exponential) instead of the TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) light term; grazing is Holling type II rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form; recycling is present but allocated via explicit (1-e) unassimilated grazing + recycling from P and Z mortalities rather than the TRUTH's beta/\u03bb and gamma/q terms. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and plankton equations that exists in the TRUTH model. Many candidate choices correspond to documented alternates in the literature (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Beer\u2013Lambert irradiance, Holling II grazing, linear P mortality, quadratic Z mortality, assimilation efficiency-based Z growth).",
