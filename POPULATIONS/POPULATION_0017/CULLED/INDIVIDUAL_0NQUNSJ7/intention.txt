ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:

The current NPZ model implements standard plankton dynamics with nutrient limitation (Michaelis-Menten), 
grazing (Holling Type II), and nutrient recycling. The model structure is mathematically sound with 
appropriate soft constraints to maintain biological realism.

PARAMETER ANALYSIS:
The phytoplankton growth rate parameter (r = 1.0 day^-1) has been updated from literature, indicating 
a productive system with fast-growing phytoplankton typical of oceanic mixed layers. However, the 
current model only accounts for nutrient limitation, which is incomplete for oceanic systems.

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The model lacks LIGHT LIMITATION, which is a critical driver of phytoplankton dynamics in oceanic 
mixed layers. Light availability varies with:
- Depth in the mixed layer
- Season and latitude
- Self-shading from phytoplankton biomass itself

PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
Add light limitation with self-shading effects to phytoplankton growth. This implements a more 
realistic representation where growth is limited by BOTH nutrients AND light.

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Add parameter I_0: incident light intensity at surface (W m^-2 or Î¼mol photons m^-2 s^-1)
2. Add parameter k_w: background light attenuation coefficient for water (m^-1)
3. Add parameter k_c: specific light attenuation coefficient for phytoplankton self-shading (m^2 g^-1 C)
4. Add parameter H: mixed layer depth (m)
5. Add parameter I_k: light saturation parameter for phytoplankton (W m^-2)

The light limitation factor uses depth-averaged light availability with self-shading:
- Light at depth z: I(z) = I_0 * exp(-(k_w + k_c * P) * z)
- Average light in mixed layer: I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-(k_w + k_c * P) * H)) / ((k_w + k_c * P) * H)
- Light limitation: L = I_avg / (I_avg + I_k)

Growth becomes: r * (N / (K_N + N)) * (I_avg / (I_avg + I_k)) * P

This represents multiplicative co-limitation where both resources must be available for growth.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Captures seasonal and depth-dependent light dynamics
- Represents self-shading feedback (high P reduces light, limiting further growth)
- Essential for realistic bloom dynamics and oscillations in NPZ systems
- Well-established in oceanographic models (e.g., NPZD models)
- Maintains model parsimony while adding critical realism

EXPECTED IMPACT:
- More realistic phytoplankton bloom dynamics
- Better representation of seasonal cycles
- Improved model fit if data shows light-limited periods
- Self-shading creates negative feedback stabilizing blooms
