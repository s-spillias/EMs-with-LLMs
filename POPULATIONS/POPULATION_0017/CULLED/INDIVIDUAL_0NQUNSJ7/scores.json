  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth -> zooplankton grazing -> recycling) but uses different functional forms for several processes and omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms present in the TRUTH model. Key similarities: nutrient-limited, light-limited phytoplankton growth; grazing-driven zooplankton growth with an assimilation efficiency; recycling from grazing inefficiency and from mortality. Key differences: explicit depth-averaged light calculation with self-shading (an extra process not in TRUTH), Holling type II grazing vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional form, quadratic density-dependent zooplankton mortality vs TRUTH's linear mortality, and no explicit mixing/entrainment terms for N, P, Z (TRUTH has k*(N0-N) in dN/dt and (s+k)*P in dP/dt).",
