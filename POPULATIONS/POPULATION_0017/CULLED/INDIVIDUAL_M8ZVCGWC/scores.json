  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but differs from the TRUTH in key functional forms and some missing processes. Uptake is implemented as classic Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limitation (N/(K_N+N)) times P (alternate to the TRUTH which multiplies Monod N-limitation by an additional a/(b + c*P) factor). Grazing is a Holling-II saturating form (g * P/(K_P+P) * Z) while TRUTH uses a sigmoidal (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) Holling-III type term. Phytoplankton non-grazing mortality is linear and matches TRUTH structurally. Zooplankton growth is from assimilated grazing (epsilon * grazing) \u2014 analogous to TRUTH\u2019s alpha * predation term but with a different functional response. The candidate uses quadratic zooplankton mortality (density-dependent) rather than TRUTH\u2019s linear loss. Notably, the candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for N, P or Z (TRUTH has k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P etc.), and it does not route unassimilated grazing to nutrients (unassimilated fraction 1-epsilon is not returned to N). Model infrastructure elements (observation errors, soft parameter penalties, Euler integration, non-negativity enforcement) are present but are not counted as extra ecological processes.",
