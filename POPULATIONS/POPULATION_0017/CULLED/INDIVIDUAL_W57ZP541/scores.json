  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (uptake, recycling, growth, grazing, mortality) but uses different mechanistic formulations in several places. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented with a Droop (internal quota) framework combined with Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake and an explicit light-limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert average light), rather than the TRUTH model's explicit external Michaelis-Menten-like nutrient term with a P-dependent denominator. Grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a Type-III-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH. Phytoplankton non-grazing mortality is linear and matches TRUTH structurally, but the candidate lacks the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton, and lacks an explicit mixing term for zooplankton. The candidate also adds explicit internal quota dynamics, detailed light attenuation/mixed-layer averaging, and Q10 temperature scaling \u2014 processes not present in the TRUTH Python model.",
