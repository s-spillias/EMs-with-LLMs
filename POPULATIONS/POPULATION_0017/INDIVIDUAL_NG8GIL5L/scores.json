  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 zooplankton grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) but uses alternate functional forms for many processes and omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH. Key differences: nutrient uptake is a Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake multiplied by an explicit light limitation (TRUTH used N/(e+N) \u00d7 a/(b+cP)); grazing is Holling type II (TRUTH uses a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form); zooplankton growth uses a food-dependent assimilation efficiency (variable e_effective) rather than a constant alpha; mortality and sinking closures differ (candidate includes quadratic aggregation and quadratic Z mortality). The candidate also adds explicit temperature Q10 scaling, Beer\u2013Lambert light attenuation with mixed-layer averaging, and an explicit recycling fraction for sinking aggregates \u2014 processes not present in TRUTH.",
