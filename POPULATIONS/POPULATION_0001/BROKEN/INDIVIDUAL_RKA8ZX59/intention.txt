Assessment and Improvement:
The current model uses a logistic outbreak trigger computed as:
  trigger = 1 / (1 + exp(-(cots_pred[t-1] - threshold))),
which provides a smooth transition to outbreak conditions. However, the fixed sensitivity implicit in this formulation limits the modelâ€™s ability to capture abrupt outbreak onsets and rapid transitions seen in empirical data.
Our evaluation suggests that by introducing a sensitivity parameter (alpha) into the logistic function:
  trigger = 1 / (1 + exp(-alpha * (cots_pred[t-1] - threshold))),
the model can better represent the system dynamics. A higher alpha yields a steeper transition, allowing for improved calibration of the outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
This adjustment is ecologically justified as outbreak initiation in Crown-of-Thorns starfish may be highly sensitive to small deviations from threshold densities due to environmental and inter-individual feedbacks.
