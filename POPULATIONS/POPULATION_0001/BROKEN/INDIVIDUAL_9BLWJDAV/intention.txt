Assessment and Rationale:
The current model does a reasonable job capturing the outbreak boom-bust cycles of COTS and their impact on coral cover. However, the reproduction process for COTS may be oversimplified by not explicitly accounting for resource limitation at high densities. Ecologically, as the population increases, competition for resources intensifies and limits further exponential reproduction. 

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a density-dependent regulation parameter, beta, into the COTS reproduction equation. This new parameter will impose a self-limiting effect, reducing reproduction when the population is high. This mechanism reflects resource limitation in the environment and helps better capture the timing and magnitude of outbreaks.

Changes:
- A new parameter "beta" is added to the parameters JSON.
- The COTS reproduction equation is modified to subtract beta * cots_pred[t-1] in the exponent.
