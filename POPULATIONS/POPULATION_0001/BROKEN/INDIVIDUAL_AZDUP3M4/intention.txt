Assessment of the current model:
The present model utilizes a logistic outbreak trigger based solely on the previous COTS prediction and a threshold value. While this approach captures the general boom-bust cycle, residual analysis suggests the transition to outbreak conditions is not abrupt enough, leading to systematic under/over predictions during outbreak onsets.

Chosen improvement:
Introduce a new parameter, k_trigger, to control the steepness of the outbreak trigger's logistic function. This addition adjusts the non-linearity of outbreak initiation, making transitions sharper in response to small changes around the threshold. This is ecologically justified as outbreak events in COTS populations are often abrupt due to threshold effects in population dynamics.

This change is intended to better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of episodic outbreaks, ultimately enhancing the model's capacity to simulate realistic boom-bust cycles in Crown-of-Thorns starfish populations.
