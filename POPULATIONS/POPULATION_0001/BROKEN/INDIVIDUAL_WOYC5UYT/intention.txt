Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model uses an outbreak trigger based on a threshold with exponential growth/decline dynamics but lacks a density‐dependent resource limitation mechanism. Residual analysis indicates that at higher COTS densities, the model underestimates the slowdown in growth. To address this, we introduce a carrying capacity (K) parameter that modulates COTS growth using a logistic adjustment (i.e. a multiplying factor of (1 - cots_pred[t-1]/K)). This change introduces ecological realism by capturing resource limitation effects and better reproducing the boom‐bust cycles observed in the system.
