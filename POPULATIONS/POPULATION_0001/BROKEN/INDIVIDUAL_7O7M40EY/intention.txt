Model Assessment and Improvement:
-----------------------------------
The current model uses a logistic outbreak trigger with a fixed steepness, computed as:
   trigger = 1 / (1 + exp(-(cots_pred[t-1] - threshold)))
This formulation, while capturing basic outbreak dynamics, may oversimplify the abrupt transitions observed in COTS outbreaks.

Proposed Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, beta_trigger, to control the steepness of the outbreak trigger.
By modifying the exponent to include beta_trigger, the model can better capture the highly non-linear, episodic nature of outbreaks.
This approach allows for sharper transitions when the population exceeds the threshold, thereby improving the fit to observed boom-bust patterns.
