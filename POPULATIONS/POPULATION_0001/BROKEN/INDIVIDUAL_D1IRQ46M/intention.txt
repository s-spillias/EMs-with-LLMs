Assessment:
- The current model fits observed boom-bust cycles reasonably well; however, analysis of residuals shows that the linear influence of coral cover on COTS reproduction overestimates its effect at high cover levels.
- The model captures outbreak triggering well, but using a linear function to modify reproduction oversimplifies the resource limitations inherent in coral dynamics.

Chosen Improvement:
- Incorporate a saturating functional response (Holling type-II) into the COTS reproduction term by introducing a new parameter, "alpha_coral". This parameter controls the saturation of the coral effect so that as coral cover increases, its influence on COTS reproduction plateaus.
- Ecological Justification: At higher coral cover, additional coral has a diminishing impact on COTS reproduction due to limited resource usage efficiency.
