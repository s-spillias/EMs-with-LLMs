This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It captures the boom‐bust population cycles of COTS, where numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels due to an outbreak trigger and extra growth effects, and then crash due to natural mortality and intensified predation on coral communities. The model includes dynamic interactions with both fast‐growing (Acropora spp.) and slow‐growing (Faviidae spp. and Porites spp.) coral groups, incorporating resource limitations, smooth saturating functions, and feedback loops. The formulation prevents data leakage by using historical state values for predictions.
