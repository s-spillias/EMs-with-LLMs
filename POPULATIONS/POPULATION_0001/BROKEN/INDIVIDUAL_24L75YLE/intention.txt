Project Assessment and Improvement:
The current model, though capturing boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks, tends to produce unrealistic exponential growth during outbreak phases, as indicated by the residuals. 
To improve ecological realism, we introduce a resource limitation mechanism by adding a carrying capacity parameter. This logistic constraint dampens COTS growth as their numbers approach the maximum sustainable level determined by limited coral prey. 
This change is ecologically justified because available coral resources constrain COTS population explosions, and it improves predictions concerning the timing, magnitude, and duration of bursts.
