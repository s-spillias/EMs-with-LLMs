Assessment of the current model:
The model captures outbreak timing but oversimplifies coral predation by using a linear loss term. In natural systems, predators often experience saturation—predation does not scale linearly with prey abundance when prey become abundant. 

Improvement:
We introduce saturating (Michaelis–Menten) predation terms for both fast and slow coral covers. This is achieved by including new saturation parameters (k_fast and k_slow) in the predation terms, so that predation on coral is given by:
   (p4_effc * cots_pred(t-1) * coral_cover) / (1 + k * coral_cover)
This approach better captures ecological resource limitation on predation efficiency.
