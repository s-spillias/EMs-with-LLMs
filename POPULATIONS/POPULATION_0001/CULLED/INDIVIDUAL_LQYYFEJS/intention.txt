Our model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It captures boom‚Äêbust cycles, where COTS numbers surge to outbreak levels and subsequently decline. The model incorporates multiple forms of resource limitation, selective predation on coral communities (both fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites), and feedback loops between COTS and coral dynamics. Environmental conditions modulate key rate processes, and smooth functional responses ensure numerical stability and ecological realism.
