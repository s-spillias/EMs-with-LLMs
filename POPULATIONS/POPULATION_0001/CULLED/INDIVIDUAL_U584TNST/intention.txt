Assessment and Model Improvement Notes:
-----------------------------------------
1. Current Model Assessment:
   - The model uses logistic growth for COTS and linear predation on coral.
   - Residual analysis indicates systematic misfits during outbreak peaks, suggesting that the linear predation term may overestimate coral decline when starfish are highly abundant.
   - This may result in unrealistic boom‐bust dynamics.

2. Chosen Ecological Improvement:
   - We introduce a saturating (Michaelis–Menten type) functional response for coral predation.
   - This modification prevents excessive coral loss by moderating the predation effect at high COTS densities.
   - The new parameter "gamma" represents the saturation constant controlling this non‐linearity.

3. Ecological Rationale:
   - In nature, high densities of COTS may not proportionally increase coral consumption due to limitations in prey accessibility or coral recovery mechanisms.
   - The saturating term thus better captures the feedback mechanisms needed to reproduce realistic outbreak dynamics as described in the project context.
