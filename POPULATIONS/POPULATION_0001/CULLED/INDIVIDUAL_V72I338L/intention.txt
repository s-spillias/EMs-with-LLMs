Assessment:
1. The current model reasonably replicates baseline population and coral dynamics but underestimates the rapid onset of COTS outbreaks, leading to a lag in predicting explosive boom events.
2. While the model addresses coral predation and logistic regulation, it lacks a mechanism that triggers rapid growth when COTS densities exceed a critical threshold.
3. Key ecological process missing: an outbreak trigger that dramatically increases COTS growth once a threshold density is passed.

Chosen improvement:
We introduce a threshold-based outbreak dynamic. Two new parameters are added: "theta" defines the critical COTS abundance (individuals per m²) above which the outbreak mechanism is activated, and "r_outbreak" provides an additional growth rate factor (year⁻¹) when this threshold is exceeded. This improved formulation is ecologically justified as empirical evidence suggests that once COTS populations exceed a critical density, outbreak dynamics accelerate rapidly.
