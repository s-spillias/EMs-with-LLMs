Assessment and rationale:
The current model's linear predation loss term leads to unrealistically high predation rates at high coral densities and does not capture the ecological limitation of predator feeding. Analysis of the residuals revealed systematic deviations during outbreak peaks. By introducing a saturating (Holling Type II) functional response in the predation term—with the new parameters gamma_fast and gamma_slow representing the half-saturation constants—the model now simulates a more ecologically realistic predation process. This adjustment aligns the model with the observed boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and ensures that predictions rely solely on past time-step values to prevent data leakage.
