Project Assessment:
The current model captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth and linear environmental feedback from coral cover. However, residual analysis indicates that the model may oversimplify the influence of coral cover on COTS growth. Ecologically, high coral cover likely leads to a saturating effect due to resource limitation and competition.

Ecological Improvement:
We add a new parameter "delta" to introduce a saturating (Hill-type) response in the environmental feedback. This modifies the influence of coral cover (the sum of fast_pred and slow_pred) on COTS growth such that increases in coral cover beyond a certain level have diminishing effects, better reflecting resource limitations.

Key Assumptions:
1. Only previous time step values are used in prediction calculations, avoiding data leakage.
2. The saturating formulation balances increased model realism with minimal added complexity.
