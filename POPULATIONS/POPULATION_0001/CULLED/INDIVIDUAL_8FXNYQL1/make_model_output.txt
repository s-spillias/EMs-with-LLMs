Below are the proposed changes. We will update three files:                                                                                                                                                            

 1 POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0001/INDIVIDUAL_8FXNYQL1/intention.txt – document the assessment and improvement reasoning.                                                                                                  
 2 POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0001/INDIVIDUAL_8FXNYQL1/parameters.json – add a new parameter "delta" to govern the non‑linear (saturating) feedback of coral cover on COTS growth.                                         
 3 POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0001/INDIVIDUAL_8FXNYQL1/model.cpp – update the cots_growth calculation to use a Hill‑type (saturating) function that includes the new "delta" parameter.

 The current model captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth and linear environmental feedback from coral cover. However, residual analysis indicates that the model may           
 oversimplify the influence of coral cover on COTS growth. Ecologically, high coral cover likely leads to a saturating effect due to resource limitation and competition.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Ecological Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                               
 We add a new parameter "delta" to introduce a saturating (Hill-type) response in the environmental feedback. This modifies the influence of coral cover (the sum of fast_pred and slow_pred) on COTS growth such that 
 increases in coral cover beyond a certain level have diminishing effects, better reflecting resource limitations.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Key Assumptions:                                                                                                                                                                                                      
 1. Only previous time step values are used in prediction calculations, avoiding data leakage.                                                                                                                         
 2. The saturating formulation balances increased model realism with minimal added complexity.

Fixing broken model iteration: 0
Below is the proposed change. We need to add a declaration for the delta parameter in model.cpp so that it is recognized in the cots_growth equation. This involves inserting a new PARAMETER(delta) line after the    
gamma declaration.
