Assessment and Improvements:
The current model captures the basic outbreak dynamics of COTS via logistic growth and predation-induced coral loss. However, the predation term is modeled linearly, which may overestimate coral consumption at high cover values. In reality, predation is limited by feeding rates and typically follows a saturating (Michaelis–Menten) response. To reflect this, we introduce two new parameters, gamma_fast and gamma_slow, representing the half‐saturation constants for fast- and slow-growing coral predation, respectively. This improvement should yield a more realistic estimation of outbreak magnitude and duration.
