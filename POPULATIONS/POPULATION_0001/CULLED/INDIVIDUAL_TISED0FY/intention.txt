Objective: Predict episodic Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS; Acanthaster cf. solaris) outbreaks (timing, magnitude, duration) on the Great Barrier Reef while accounting for feedbacks with their coral prey: fast-growing Acropora (fast) and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites (slow). The model captures characteristic boom–bust cycles driven by temperature-modified reproduction, pulsed larval immigration, resource limitation via prey availability, maturation delays, and density dependence, while corals exhibit logistic growth, temperature sensitivity (bleaching), and selective predation by COTS.

State variables (annual time step):
- A_t: Adult COTS density (individuals per m2).
- J_t: Juvenile COTS density (individuals per m2; latent to represent maturation delay).
- F_t: Fast coral cover (%; Acropora).
- S_t: Slow coral cover (%; Faviidae + Porites).

Forcings:
- sst_t: Sea-surface temperature (°C).
- I_t: Larval immigration rate (individuals/m2/year).

Key processes:
- Larval production and settlement: Adult fecundity is scaled by prey availability (saturating function of weighted coral cover) and SST (smooth logistic temperature response), plus exogenous larval immigration. Settlement to juveniles is subject to density-dependent saturation and efficiency.
- Maturation and survival: Juveniles mature into adults with density-dependent transition; both stages experience mortality.
- Selective predation: Adults feed preferentially on fast corals using a Holling Type II functional response with prey preference and handling time; predation pressure scales coral cover losses.
- Coral dynamics: Each coral group grows logistically under a shared carrying capacity (space competition), is reduced by COTS predation, and is negatively impacted by warm SST via a smooth bleaching mortality modifier.
- Feedbacks and outbreaks: Pulsed immigration and favorable SST can elevate juvenile recruitment, which with maturation delay amplifies adult abundance; prey depletion and density dependence generate bust phases.

Data assimilation and predictions:
- Initial conditions fixed to the first observations for A, F, S.
- Likelihoods: lognormal for adult COTS (strictly positive), logit-normal for coral cover (bounded 0–100%), and constant-weight checks for forcings.
- Numerical stability: small epsilons, smooth softplus thresholds, and soft penalties that nudge parameters within biological bounds.
