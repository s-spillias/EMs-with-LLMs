Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

Evaluation:
1. The current model fits the data reasonably but uses a hard threshold to trigger outbreak dynamics which can introduce discontinuities.
2. While the model captures boom-bust cycles and predation on coral, the binary outbreak trigger oversimplifies the gradual onset of outbreak events.
3. Key ecological process missing is the smooth transition to outbreak dynamics as COTS density increases.

Improvement Chosen:
We introduce a sigmoid (nonlinear) transition function for outbreak growth:
    outbreak_growth = r_outbreak * cots_pred[t-1] * (1 / (1 + exp(-s*(cots_pred[t-1]-theta))))
Here, s is a new parameter representing the slope of outbreak activation.
This adjustment adds ecological realism by ensuring a gradual rather than abrupt change in dynamics.

Next steps:
- Update parameter set to include s.
- Modify model.cpp accordingly.
