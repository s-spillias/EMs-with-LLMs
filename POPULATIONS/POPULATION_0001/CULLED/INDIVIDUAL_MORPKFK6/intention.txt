Assessment and rationale for model improvement

Fit to data
- A residuals file was referenced but not provided here, so this assessment is based on structural considerations common in COTS boom–bust modeling.
- The current structure is generally adequate to reproduce outbreaks: it includes prey-dependent carrying capacity for COTS, an Allee effect, SST modifiers, functional response predation on fast/slow corals, immigration with short lag, and starvation mortality.
- Typical deficiency in similar models: coral recovers too quickly after severe depletion because growth is only space-limited, not broodstock-limited. This can cause too-rapid re-accumulation of prey, shortening the bust phase and allowing prematurely frequent re-outbreaks. In residuals, this often appears as positive coral residuals (model overpredicts coral) following crashes.

Alignment with project context
- Strengths: Selective predation is explicit; multiple feedbacks support boom-bust cycles; SST effects included; immigration lag captured.
- Gaps: No explicit environmental driver for larval survival pulses (e.g., nutrients/runoff). More importantly for outbreak duration, coral regeneration lacks depensation at low cover.

Missing/oversimplified processes
- Coral depensation (broodstock limitation) is missing. Empirical reef dynamics show slower recovery when coral cover is very low even with ample space, due to limited reproductive output, settlement limitations, and post-settlement mortality interactions.

Chosen single improvement: Coral depensation in growth
- Approach: Resource/regeneration limitation via a smooth Allee-type factor on coral growth based on total coral cover.
- Formulation:
  Let X_tot = F_prev + S_prev (percent).
  Phi_C = invlogit(k_coral_allee * (X_tot − C_crit)).
  Modify growth terms:
    growthF := rF * F_prev * space_lim * (1 − alpha_bleach_growthF * B) * Phi_C
    growthS := rS * S_prev * space_lim * (1 − alpha_bleach_growthS * B) * Phi_C
- Ecological justification: At low coral cover, broodstock and recruitment processes are limiting; this slows recovery and sustains the bust phase after outbreaks. This interacts positively with existing starvation mortality and prey-dependent carrying capacity to produce more realistic post-outbreak dynamics and return intervals.
- Complexity tradeoff: Adds two interpretable parameters and one multiplier; avoids data leakage; retains differentiability.

Expected effects on residual patterns
- Reduce positive coral residuals after large crashes (i.e., curb overly fast predicted coral recovery).
- Lengthen low-coral, low-COTS intervals, smoothing timing of the next outbreak peak.
- Potentially improve magnitude/timing of COTS busts via combined starvation and low K_A.

Notes
- If residuals show under-amplified or mistimed outbreak peaks attributable to larval survival pulses, a future extension could add an environmental modifier to immigration effectiveness (e.g., runoff proxy), but that requires additional exogenous data and is beyond the single change requested here.
