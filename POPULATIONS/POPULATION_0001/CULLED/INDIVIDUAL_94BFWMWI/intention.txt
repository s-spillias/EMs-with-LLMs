This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
It mechanistically captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations through a combination of:
1. Outbreak triggers based on environmental conditions and threshold effects.
2. Saturating growth and decay processes, where rapid population explosions are followed by declines.
3. Selective predation on coral communities, differentiating between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) 
   and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Porities spp.) corals.
4. Feedback loops and indirect effects where coral health influences, and is influenced by, COTS densities.
The ecosystem dynamics are simulated using lagged (previous timestep) population values to ensure 
robust predictions and avoid data leakage.
