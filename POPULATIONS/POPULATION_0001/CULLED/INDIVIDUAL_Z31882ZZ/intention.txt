Project Assessment and Model Improvement:
1. Assessment:
   - The current model uses logistic growth for COTS and linear predation impacts on coral. While it captures the boom-bust cycles,
     it may overestimate coral losses at high coral cover due to the linear predation term.
   - Residuals indicate potential over-prediction of coral decline when coral cover is high.
2. Chosen Improvement:
   - Incorporate a saturating (Holling type II) functional response for coral consumption by COTS. This prevents unrealistic coral losses
     by limiting the predation rate when coral abundance is high, corresponding to resource handling limitations.
3. Ecological Justification:
   - The half-saturation constants (H_fast and H_slow) adjust the intensity of predation such that beyond a certain coral density the consumption rate plateaus.
   - This change aligns with ecological observations where predators cannot indefinitely increase consumption with increasing prey density.
4. Implementation:
   - Updated the model equations in model.cpp to use previous time step predictions and apply a saturating function.
   - Added parameters H_fast and H_slow in parameters.json for fast and slow coral, respectively.
