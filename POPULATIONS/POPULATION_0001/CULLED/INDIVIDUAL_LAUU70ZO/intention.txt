Assessment:
- The current model fits the data moderately well but underestimates the rapid onset and collapse of COTS outbreaks.
- The model addresses selective predation on different coral types; however, the linear predation term oversimplifies the predatorâ€“prey dynamics.
  
Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce a saturating predation term (Holling Type II functional response) to better capture how predation efficiency saturates at high prey densities.
- Added a new parameter "delta" to control the saturation effect. Ecologically, delta represents limitations in predator processing capacity, allowing explosive COTS growth when coral prey is abundant.
- All predictions continue to use only previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
