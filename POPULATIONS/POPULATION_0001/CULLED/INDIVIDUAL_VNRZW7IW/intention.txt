The model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef by incorporating boom-bust dynamics.
1. COTS dynamics follow logistic growth subject to resource (coral) limitations and selective predation.
2. Fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Porites spp.) coral communities are modeled as prey with predation losses.
3. Environmental modifiers and saturating functional responses capture smooth transitions and threshold effects.
4. Feedback loops and indirect effects (e.g., reduced coral cover further altering COTS dynamics) are integrated.
This approach allows us to track the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events while minimizing numerical issues.
