Assessment and rationale for improvement

1) Fit to data
- Residuals file was not provided here, so a quantitative residual-based assessment is not possible in this context.
- Structurally, the model is well-posed and can produce boom-bust dynamics via: (i) an immigration-triggered outbreak mechanism, (ii) Allee effect on adult growth, (iii) resource-modified carrying capacity, and (iv) strong predation on corals feeding back on food supply. However, one likely source of systematic residual patterns is the lack of temperature dependence in the per-predator feeding rate. Because COTS are ectotherms, feeding rates typically increase toward an optimum with temperature. Without this modifier, coral declines may be mis-timed (e.g., under-predicted in warm years and over-predicted in cool years) relative to observed outbreak years, even if adult COTS abundance is well captured.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model already targets episodic outbreaks and selective predation across coral groups (fast vs slow), including triggers via larval immigration thresholds and Allee effects that can sustain rapid increases.
- It includes temperature impacts on COTS demographic performance and coral growth. Yet, feeding (coral consumption) itself is not temperature-modified, which weakens the ecological linkage between warm conditions and both outbreak severity and coral loss—central to the timing, magnitude, and duration of observed boom-bust cycles on the GBR.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Temperature dependence of feeding rate (missing): feeding (attack rate) should vary with temperature, typically peaking at warmer conditions near an optimum.
- Heat-stress mortality of corals (oversimplified): temperature only modulates growth (Gaussian) but does not directly increase mortality during warm anomalies—this could be addressed later if residuals indicate rapid coral crashes during heatwaves.
- Stage structure / time-lag in recruitment (missing): outbreaks often involve cohort dynamics; not addressed here to keep the model parsimonious.
- Natural enemy control or removals (missing): not currently included.

Chosen improvement: Environmental modifier of COTS feeding rate

Ecological justification
- COTS feeding is temperature-sensitive (ectotherm physiology). Warmer years near thermal optima increase feeding rates and thus coral loss. This strengthens the outbreak feedback loop: warm temperatures boost consumption, reducing edible coral and eventually curtailing COTS growth via food limitation, creating sharper boom-bust dynamics aligned with environmental conditions.

Mathematical change
- Modify the per-predator consumption term to include a Gaussian thermal modifier for feeding, f_T,feed, evaluated at the previous time step’s temperature:
  f_T,feed(t-1) = exp(-0.5 * ((SST(t-1) - sst_opt_feed) / sst_sd_feed)^2)
  c_ppred(t-1) = attack_max * f_T,feed(t-1) * E(t-1)^2 / (E(t-1)^2 + h_type3^2)
- This affects total consumption pressure C_all(t-1) = N(t-1) * c_ppred(t-1), and therefore the loss terms L_fast and L_slow.

Implementation notes
- Added parameters sst_opt_feed (°C) and log_sst_sd_feed (log(°C)).
- Feeding thermal breadth sst_sd_feed = exp(log_sst_sd_feed) + 1e-6.
- All dynamic calculations use only previous-step forcings and states to avoid data leakage.
- Added diagnostic output temp_mod_feed_pred for interpretability and model checking.

Parameterization and priors
- Initial values set to match COTS demographic temperature parameters (sst_opt_cots and log_sst_sd_cots) as neutral starting points; the data can move them if feeding and demographic optima differ.
- Weak priors:
  - sst_opt_feed ~ Normal(29.0, sd = 1.5)
  - log_sst_sd_feed ~ Normal(log(1.5), sd = 1.0)

Expected effects on fit and dynamics
- Warmer years close to sst_opt_feed will increase per-predator consumption, amplifying coral loss and producing stronger busts following booms, better capturing timing/magnitude of coral declines during outbreaks.
- Cooler years will dampen consumption, reducing coral loss when temperatures are suboptimal, potentially improving residual structure if over-prediction of coral loss in cool years was present.

Future considerations (not implemented here)
- If residuals show abrupt coral crashes during heatwaves beyond what feeding modulation explains, consider adding a temperature-driven mortality term for corals.
- If outbreak timing remains off, consider cohort delay (stage structure) or temperature/nutrient modulation of larval survival beyond the current immigration trigger.
