Assessment:
The current model demonstrates logistic growth with saturating predation dynamics and captures the basic outbreak patterns. However, observations suggest that as coral communities decline, the efficiency of converting coral losses into COTS growth may also decline. This hints at a potential data-driven mechanism behind the boomâ€“bust cycles.

Improvement:
We introduce a dynamic efficiency term where the effective efficiency (beta_eff) scales with the total coral cover at the previous time step relative to the initial total coral cover. This is computed as:
  effective_beta = beta * ((fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / (baseline_coral + eps));
By doing so, when coral cover is high, conversion is efficient, but as coral declines, the effective beta reduces, leading to a more pronounced bust phase.
