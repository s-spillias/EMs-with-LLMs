Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model reasonably captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS populations using a logistic outbreak trigger and linear modifications from coral cover.
2. However, ecological processes such as saturation effects and nonlinear feedbacks in coral–COTS interactions are oversimplified. In reality, at very high or low coral covers, the effect on COTS reproduction may accelerate or saturate instead of following a strictly linear trend.
3. To address this, we introduce quadratic terms (phi_fast2 and phi_slow2) in the reproduction term. This adjustment provides a higher‐order (nonlinear) representation that better captures resource limitation and indirect feedback mechanisms.
4. Additionally, we ensure predictions use only previous time step values (i.e. *_pred) to fully avoid data leakage from current observations.
