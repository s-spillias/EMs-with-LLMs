Assessment and targeted improvement for COTS outbreak dynamics

Summary of current fit:
- Residuals file not provided here; pending quantitative assessment. Data checks report no obvious issues (no NA, bounds OK).
- Conceptually, the model produces boom-bust cycles via food-limited mortality, carrying capacity tied to coral, an Allee effect, SST modifiers, and immigration pulses.

Alignment with project context:
- Outbreak timing and magnitude are driven by food availability (coral cover), immigration pulses, and SST.
- Selective predation on coral guilds (fast Acropora vs slow Faviidae/Porites) is represented via a multi-prey functional response and separate conversion to cover loss.
- Boom-bust cycles are supported by starvation mortality after coral depletion and density dependence.

Identified oversimplification:
- Fecundity boost from feeding was linear, which can cause unrealistically high reproduction at high coral availability, prolonging outbreaks and overshooting peaks.

Chosen ecological improvement: Resource limitation via saturating fecundity response
- Implemented a Michaelisâ€“Menten-type saturation linking per-capita consumption to fecundity:
  fecundity_boost = 1 + eta_fec * percap_cons / (percap_cons + c_fec50)
- Adds a half-saturation parameter c_fec50 controlling sensitivity at low feeding and bounding maximum fecundity boost to 1 + eta_fec.
- Ecological rationale: Gametogenesis and effective recruitment scale sublinearly with intake and spawning success; diminishing returns are expected at high food levels.

Key ecological processes retained:
- No data leakage: state recursion uses only previous-time states and exogenous forcings (sst_dat, cotsimm_dat).
- Starvation mortality uses a steep logistic on per-capita consumption shortfall (c_starve50, k_starve).
- Carrying capacity depends on weighted coral cover (wK_F, wK_S) plus baseline kK0.
- Bleaching affects coral growth and mortality and indirectly feeds back on COTS via food supply.

Parameter updates checked:
- c_fec50 present in parameters.json; now declared in model.cpp and used in the fecundity function.
- Soft parameter bounds in model.cpp include c_fec50 within [0,3], consistent with parameters.json suggestions.
- Other parameters (e.g., q_fr near 1) maintain a Type II functional response.

Why this improves boom-bust realism:
- Caps runaway fecundity when coral is abundant, aiding realistic outbreak peaks and facilitating post-peak declines as prey depletes.
- Maintains sensitivity at low food, allowing recruitment to respond to early recovery and immigration pulses without excessive amplification.

Next steps after residual review (not performed here):
- If peaks are still too high/long, tune eta_fec downward or increase c_fec50.
- If outbreak initiation is too sluggish, reduce c_fec50 or modestly increase eta_fec.
- Consider adding density-dependent disease mortality at very high A if residuals indicate overly slow bust phases.
