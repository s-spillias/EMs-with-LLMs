Assessment:
The current model uses a linear environmental modifier (gamma) multiplied by the sum of fast- and slow-growing coral cover to enhance COTS growth. Although this captures a feedback between coral abundance and COTS outbreaks, it risks overestimating growth when coral cover is high because it ignores saturation, potentially leading to unrealistic outbreak predictions.

Chosen Improvement:
We introduce a saturating effect by adding a new parameter, delta, and replacing the linear modifier 
    (1.0 + gamma * (fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]))
with a saturating formulation 
    1.0 + gamma * coral_effect / (1.0 + delta * coral_effect)
where coral_effect = fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1].
This change limits the enhancement as coral cover increases, better reflecting resource limitations and ecological realism.

Only past predictions (t-1) are used for all calculations to avoid data leakage.
