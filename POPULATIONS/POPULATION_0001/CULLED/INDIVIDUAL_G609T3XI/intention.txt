Purpose: Predict episodic boom–bust outbreaks of Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS; Acanthaster cf. solaris) on the Great Barrier Reef and their impacts on two coral guilds: fast-growing Acropora (fast) and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites (slow). The model is designed for forecasting given initial conditions and time-varying environmental forcing.

Ecological functioning (concise):
- State variables: Adult COTS density (ind/m^2), fast coral cover (%), slow coral cover (%).
- Outbreak trigger and sustainment: Adult COTS dynamics combine (i) endogenous density regulation with an Allee effect (reduced growth at very low density), (ii) a coral-dependent carrying capacity (more coral → more support for COTS), (iii) positive feedback from feeding (consumed coral fuels COTS net growth with an efficiency), and (iv) exogenous larval immigration pulses (cotsimm_dat) that can kick-start outbreaks. Temperature (sst_dat) modulates COTS net growth.
- Coral dynamics: Each coral guild follows space-limited regrowth (logistic with total coral cover reducing free space), environmental stress from high SST (smooth bleaching mortality and suppressed growth), and selective predation by COTS via a multi-prey functional response (Type II/III) with handling times and preferences (Acropora preferred).
- Feedback loops: COTS reduce coral cover through predation; reduced coral lowers COTS carrying capacity, hastening busts. During booms, high COTS density accelerates coral loss (especially Acropora), further tightening the subsequent bust. Environmental anomalies (SST) can amplify both coral mortality and COTS recruitment/survival.
- Numerical stability: All transitions use smooth functions (logistic/softplus), small constants prevent division by zero, and parameters are softly bounded with penalties. Likelihoods use log/logit transforms with minimum standard deviations and include all observations each time step.
