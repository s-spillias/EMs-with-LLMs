The current model effectively captures the boom–bust dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks with logistic growth and coral predation. However, using a linear formulation for predation loss oversimplifies the ecological processes: at high COTS densities, predation is likely to saturate due to limitations such as handling time and resource availability. To better capture this dynamic, I have introduced a saturating (Michaelis–Menten) response in the predation term. The new parameter, h_pred, represents the half‐saturation constant and ensures that predation losses do not unrealistically scale linearly with COTS density. This modification enhances the model’s ability to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events without using any current time step response values in the prediction calculations.
