Assessment and rationale for model improvement

1) How well the model fits the data
- A residuals file was referenced but not available in this chat. Without residuals or fit diagnostics, I cannot quantitatively assess goodness of fit or identify bias over time, magnitude, or phases (boom vs. bust).
- Structurally, the model is capable of reproducing outbreak dynamics: it has an immigration trigger, food limitation, type III predation with preference, resource-modified carrying capacity, and a density-triggered outbreak mortality. These mechanisms should help match timing and magnitude of booms.

Action requested: please provide the residuals file (and if available, per-series residual summaries) so I can refine the assessment and check for phase-specific biases (e.g., underpredicted collapse rates).

2) Does the model address the PROJECT CONTEXT?
- Strengths relative to context:
  - Outbreak initiation: immigration trigger with slope and threshold, plus temperature-modified performance.
  - Outbreak growth: resource-limited per-capita growth and resource-modified capacity.
  - Selective predation: Holling type III response and diet preference that elevates pressure on fast coral.
  - Collapse driver: density-dependent outbreak mortality (disease/starvation-like) that activates smoothly.
- Gap relative to context:
  - The “bust” phase is not explicitly tied to food scarcity. After consumption reduces edible coral, adult mortality should increase due to starvation and predation risk. Currently, low food reduces growth (f_food) but does not increase mortality, except indirectly via density-driven outbreak mortality. This can prolong high COTS densities even when edible coral is low, weakening realism of collapse timing and duration.

3) Missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Explicit starvation mortality at low edible coral availability.
- Other potentially important processes (not included here to keep complexity limited to one change):
  - Low-density reproductive Allee effects.
  - Stage structure (juvenile refuge vs. adult feeding).
  - Environmental drivers of larval survival beyond immigration (e.g., runoff/nutrient pulses).
  - Predator recovery or culling.
  - Settlement-habitat limitations and structural complexity.

Chosen improvement (one change)
- Approach: Resource limitation mechanism affecting mortality.
- Addition: Starvation mortality term that increases as food saturation declines.
  - Define fsat = E / (E + Hh_food), already in the model for growth limitation.
  - Add m_starv_eff = m_starv * (1 - fsat) to the adult mortality, where m_starv is a new parameter (year^-1).
  - Effective mortality becomes: m_eff = m_cots + m_disease * f_burst + m_starv * (1 - fsat)
- Ecological justification:
  - When edible coral is depleted by an outbreak, adult COTS experience elevated starvation mortality. This mechanism helps terminate outbreaks and shapes the duration of the bust, aligning with observed boom-bust cycles.
- Complexity justification:
  - Adds only one parameter and leverages an existing food saturation term, minimizing identifiability risks and avoiding new functional forms or thresholds.
- Data leakage:
  - The update uses only lagged state variables (E computed from F_prev and S_prev), consistent with the no data-leakage requirement.

Parameter notes
- New parameter: log_m_starv (log(year^-1)), weak prior around ln(0.3), broad bounds.
- No structural changes required by the literature-updated coral parameters at this time. If residuals reveal systematic biases in coral recovery or SST responses, we can revisit thermal breadths or competitive structure.

Next steps upon receiving residuals
- Check for phase-specific biases (boom ascent vs. collapse).
- Examine whether outbreak duration and peak timing improve with the starvation term.
- If collapses are still too slow, consider complementing with a mild Allee effect in reproduction, but only if warranted by diagnostics.
