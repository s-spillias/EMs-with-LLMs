Assessment and Model Improvement:

The current model effectively captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) through logistic growth and selective coral predation. However, the rapid escalation phases (outbreaks) appear underrepresented. To better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks, I have introduced a non-linear enhancement parameter, delta, into the growth term. This parameter represents environmental or density-dependent feedback that amplifies the intrinsic growth rate at higher population densities, providing a variable efficiency term that triggers and sustains outbreak events. All predictions are made using previous time step values only, ensuring no data leakage.
