Assessment:
- The current model fits the data reasonably but shows systematic residual patterns that suggest the predation effects on coral may be too linear. This linearity oversimplifies the dynamics of coral consumption by COTS.
- An ecological mechanism potentially missing is the threshold-driven, non-linear response (Holling Type III) in predation: at low coral cover, COTS predation is less effective, but once coral cover increases past a threshold, consumption rates accelerate markedly.
Chosen Improvement:
- Replace the Type II functional response in the coral consumption terms with a Type III response by squaring the coral cover in both the numerator and denominator. This change captures a realistic threshold and saturation behavior, which is critical for modeling the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks.
