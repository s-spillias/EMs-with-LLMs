Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model produces the expected boom-bust cycles, but its linear formulation for coral predation may overestimate losses when coral cover is high. To better capture ecological realism, we introduce a saturating functional response by including two new parameters (gamma_fast and gamma_slow) that modulate predation efficiency on fast- and slow-growing corals respectively. This change reflects that the effectiveness of predation is limited at high coral densities (e.g., due to prey refuges or predator handling times), thereby improving the characterization of outbreak dynamics.
