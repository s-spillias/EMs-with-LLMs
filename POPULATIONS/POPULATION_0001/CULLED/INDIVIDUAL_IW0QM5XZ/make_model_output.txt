Below are the proposed changes. We will update the intention file to document our assessment and reasoning, add two new parameters (gamma_fast and gamma_slow) to the parameters file with ecological justification,   
and modify the model to use a saturating functional response in the predation term. This added complexity better captures the nonlinearities in predation as coral cover increases (i.e. predator efficiency           
saturates), which is ecologically relevant for simulating the burst‐decline dynamics of COTS outbreaks.

 The current model produces the expected boom-bust cycles, but its linear formulation for coral predation may overestimate losses when coral cover is high. To better capture ecological realism, we introduce a       
 saturating functional response by including two new parameters (gamma_fast and gamma_slow) that modulate predation efficiency on fast- and slow-growing corals respectively. This change reflects that the            
 effectiveness of predation is limited at high coral densities (e.g., due to prey refuges or predator handling times), thereby improving the characterization of outbreak dynamics.
