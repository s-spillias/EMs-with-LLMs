Assessment summary and rationale for one ecological improvement

1) Model fit to data
- Residuals file not found in the provided context, so a quantitative residual analysis (bias, autocorrelation, magnitude) cannot be performed here.
- Qualitative expectations from similar systems: models without dynamic prey-switching often
  a) under-predict the rapid take-off into outbreaks when fast-growing corals are abundant (predators concentrate on abundant prey, accelerating intake and fecundity);
  b) over-predict sustained high consumption of slow-growing corals after fast corals crash (COTS exhibit preference and switching that reduce pressure once preferred prey is depleted);
  c) show phase-lag mismatches in boom-bust timing if feeding selectivity does not dynamically respond to coral community composition.

2) Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model already targets key mechanisms for boom-bust dynamics: Allee effects, SST-modified growth, recruitment lags, density-dependent mortality, and food-limitation-induced starvation mortality. Coral dynamics include space limitation, bleaching modifiers, and predation loss.
- This aligns well with capturing outbreak rise and crash. However, selective predation is currently static via constant preferences (pref_F, pref_S). In outbreak ecology, frequency-dependent prey selection (prey-switching) is a known accelerator of booms (when preferred prey is abundant) and a natural brake post-depletion, impacting both magnitude and duration of outbreaks.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Static prey preference (oversimplified): COTS select Acropora and can switch prey as availability changes. Constant preferences can misrepresent the sharpness of outbreak peaks and the post-peak crash when preferred prey declines.
- Nutrient/river plume effects on larval survival are important in some reefs but not represented here; however, no exogenous nutrient driver is available in the current data inputs, so introducing it would risk overfitting or data leakage.
- Wave disturbance or cyclones not explicitly modeled; again, no exogenous series provided, and bleaching/SST covers thermal stress only.

Chosen single improvement: dynamic prey-switching in the functional response

Ecological reasoning
- Positive frequency-dependent predation (prey-switching) is observed in many predator–prey systems. For COTS, this reflects stronger focus on fast-growing Acropora when it dominates cover and relative de-emphasis on slow corals when their relative availability is lower.
- This mechanism can:
  a) sharpen the ascent into outbreaks (more efficient intake on abundant Acropora),
  b) reduce predation pressure on slow corals during and after Acropora decline,
  c) shorten and sharpen the bust phase via food limitation once preferred prey collapses.
- It directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT goal of capturing timing, magnitude, and duration of episodic outbreaks without adding exogenous forcings.

Mathematical implementation
- Introduce a prey-switching exponent psi_switch ≥ 0 modifying effective preferences as a function of the relative composition of available coral:
  compF = RF/(RF+RS+tiny), compS = RS/(RF+RS+tiny)
  pref_F_eff = pref_F * compF^(psi_switch)
  pref_S_eff = pref_S * compS^(psi_switch)

- Replace constant preferences in the multi-prey Type II functional response with these effective preferences in both numerator and denominator:
  RFq = (RF+tiny)^q, RSq = (RS+tiny)^q
  den = 1 + hF*aF*pref_F_eff*RFq + hS*aS*pref_S_eff*RSq
  C_F = A_prev * (aF*pref_F_eff*RFq) / den
  C_S = A_prev * (aS*pref_S_eff*RSq) / den

- psi_switch controls switching strength: psi_switch=0 recovers the current model (no change). Larger psi_switch increases positive frequency dependence.

Why this level of complexity?
- It is a single-parameter extension that leverages existing state variables (no new data streams), minimizing risk of over-parameterization.
- It modifies an already central process (feeding) that directly influences fecundity boost and starvation dynamics, key for boom-bust behavior.
- It is ecologically plausible and supported by selective predation literature for COTS and other predators.

Parameter review highlights
- q_fr is effectively fixed to 1 by tight bounds—appropriate for Type II given literature support.
- Attack rates, handling times, bleaching parameters, and mortality terms are reasonable and bounded.
- No other updated literature values here clearly demand structural changes beyond feeding selectivity; the proposed change focuses on a known simplification.

Data usage and leakage
- The implementation uses only previous-step state variables (F_prev, S_prev) and remains within the model recursion rules. No current time step observational data are used in process equations.

Testing and interpretation guidance
- If residuals show underestimation during the outbreak onset or overestimation of slow coral losses post-peak, increasing psi_switch should improve fit by enhancing dynamic selectivity.
- If outbreaks still last too long post-peak, consider tightening starvation parameters subsequently (already present in the model) after fitting psi_switch.
