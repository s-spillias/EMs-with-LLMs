Assessment:
1. The current model generally captures the boom-bust cycles but oversimplifies predation dynamics using a linear term.
2. Although it fits basic outbreak patterns, the model does not account for the saturating effect that occurs when coral is abundant.
3. This suggests that the model could benefit from including a Holling Type II (saturating) functional response for coral predation.

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a saturating (Holling Type II) functional response to coral predation. Replace the linear loss term with one that computes:
   fast_loss = (alpha_fast * fast_pred[t-1])/(1 + gamma_fast * fast_pred[t-1])
   slow_loss = (alpha_slow * slow_pred[t-1])/(1 + gamma_slow * slow_pred[t-1])
and then
   predation_loss = (fast_loss + slow_loss) * cots_pred[t-1]

This approach avoids using current time step data (preventing data leakage) and better represents the ecological limits in coral consumption, given handling time and resource saturation.
