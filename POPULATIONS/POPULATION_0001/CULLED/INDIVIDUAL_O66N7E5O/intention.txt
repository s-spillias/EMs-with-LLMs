Assessment and Change Log:
--------------------------
Current model evaluation:
- The model reasonably captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS and their impact on coral, but the linear representation of coral effects (via phi_fast and phi_slow) may oversimplify the ecological interactions.
- Residuals suggest systematic under/over-prediction at high coral cover levels, hinting that coral effects should saturate rather than grow linearly.
Chosen improvement:
- Incorporate a saturating functional response for the effect of both fast and slow coral on COTS reproduction.
  Ecological justification: In nature, the availability of coral prey may be limited and predation efficiency may decline as coral cover increases, due to handling times or interference.
- This is implemented by replacing the additive coral terms with (phi * coral_pred[t-1])/(1 + coral_pred[t-1]).
- Note: All predictions continue to use previous time step values in accordance with best practices.
