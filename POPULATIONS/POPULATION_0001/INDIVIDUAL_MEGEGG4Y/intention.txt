This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.  
It captures the boom-bust cycles where COTS populations rapidly surge (outbreak) and then decline.  
Key ecological processes include:
1. A smooth, threshold-triggered outbreak mechanism that kicks in when COTS numbers exceed an outbreak threshold.
2. Multiple forms of resource limitation via saturating (functional response) equations to account for predation on coral.
3. Selective predation on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites spp.) coral communities.
4. Coral dynamics that incorporate regeneration and losses due to predation, modulated by environmental conditions.
5. Process error and lognormal error distributions for observations to ensure numerical stability and realistic uncertainty.
