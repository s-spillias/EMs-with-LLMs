Model Assessment:
- The current model captures basic logistic growth of COTS and includes predation effects on coral cover.
- However, it oversimplifies outbreak dynamics by not incorporating how resource availability (high coral cover) can feed back to amplify COTS growth.
- Chosen improvement: Introduce an environmental modifier "gamma" that scales the COTS growth rate when coral cover is high. This reflects the ecological reality that abundant coral provides more resources for starfish, thus triggering and sustaining outbreak events.
- This adjustment uses only past time-step values (fast_pred and slow_pred) to avoid data leakage.
