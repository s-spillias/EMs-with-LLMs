Purpose: Predict episodic boomâ€“bust outbreaks of Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef and their feedbacks on coral communities, while allowing environmental forcing (SST) and larval immigration to trigger and sustain outbreaks.

Core state variables (annual time step):
- cots_dat_pred: Adult COTS density (individuals m^-2)
- fast_dat_pred: Fast-growing coral (Acropora spp.) percent cover
- slow_dat_pred: Slow-growing coral (Faviidae/Porites) percent cover

Ecological functioning:
1) COTS demography combines (a) temperature-modified survival with density-dependent (disease/crowding) mortality, (b) fecundity enhanced by food (coral availability) through a saturating function and temperature-optimum response, (c) low-density Allee effects (mate limitation), and (d) exogenous larval immigration to allow outbreak initiation and wave-like propagation.
2) Coral dynamics are resource-limited by free space and interspecific competition, with group-specific intrinsic growth. COTS impose selective predation with a multi-prey Holling type II functional response and preference toward fast-growing Acropora. Warming above a bleaching threshold increases coral mortality smoothly, with stronger sensitivity in fast corals.
3) Feedbacks: High coral cover fuels COTS recruitment (food-dependent fecundity), driving rapid COTS increases. Outbreaks elevate predation, reducing coral cover; loss of coral subsequently lowers COTS recruitment and increases mortality, yielding the bust phase.
4) Environmental modulation: Sea-surface temperature (SST) shapes both COTS performance (Gaussian optimal temperature response) and coral bleaching risk (soft-threshold heat stress). Larval immigration provides episodic external inputs that can synchronize or trigger outbreaks.
5) Numerical robustness: All rates use smooth saturating/soft-threshold functions with small constants to avoid division by zero; parameters are softly penalized to remain within biologically plausible ranges; observation models use variance floors and appropriate distributions (lognormal for COTS, logit-normal for coral cover).

Model outputs:
- Annual predictions for cots_dat_pred, fast_dat_pred, slow_dat_pred aligned with observed time stamps (Year).
- Auxiliary reports of intermediate ecological drivers (e.g., temperature response, food index) to support diagnosis of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
