Assessment:
1. The current model captures the main processes of COTS outbreaks and coral predation, but the outbreak amplification is implemented as a smooth, linear function. This may not fully capture the abrupt, threshold-like transitions observed in real COTS outbreaks.
2. The model addresses the project context by including environmental triggers, resource limitation, and selective predation, but the outbreak mechanism could be improved for realism.
3. A key ecological process that is oversimplified is the abruptness of outbreak transitions; real outbreaks often show threshold behavior, not smooth increases.

Improvement:
To better capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles and abrupt outbreak onset, I will introduce a nonlinear, threshold-like outbreak amplification using a Hill function. This will allow the outbreak boost to increase sharply once environmental triggers cross a threshold, controlled by a new parameter `hill_n_outbreak`. This approach is ecologically justified as COTS outbreaks are known to be abrupt and require critical conditions to be met.

Changes:
- Added parameter `hill_n_outbreak` to parameters.json.
- Modified model.cpp to use a Hill function for outbreak amplification.
- This should improve the model's ability to fit the timing and magnitude of observed outbreaks.
