Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, with process equations that capture logistic growth, outbreak amplification, and selective predation. However, without the residuals file, a detailed quantitative fit assessment is not possible here. Qualitatively, the model structure is reasonable for capturing boom-bust COTS cycles and coral cover changes.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model includes key features: COTS outbreaks (triggered by environmental forcing), resource limitation via coral availability, selective predation, and competition between coral groups. Outbreaks are probabilistically triggered and have a mean duration, which aligns with the episodic nature of COTS population explosions.
3. Missing or Oversimplified Processes: One potential oversimplification is the linear (or saturating) effect of coral availability on COTS predation and growth. In reality, coral communities may exhibit non-linear or threshold responses to predation pressure, especially under high COTS densities. Additionally, the model does not currently include feedback from coral depletion on future outbreak probability or COTS recruitment.

Chosen Improvement:
To better capture the non-linear feedback between coral depletion and COTS population dynamics, I will introduce a non-linear (Hill-type) functional response for COTS predation on coral. This will allow for sharper thresholds and more realistic boom-bust transitions, as predation efficiency can increase rapidly once coral is abundant, but saturate or even decline if coral becomes scarce. This is ecologically justified because COTS feeding rates and outbreak persistence are known to be highly sensitive to coral cover, and threshold effects are observed in field data.

Implementation:
- Add a Hill coefficient parameter (hill_cots) to control the non-linearity of the predation functional response.
- Replace the current Holling Type II (saturating) predation efficiency with a Hill-type response: predation_eff = pow(cots_pred(t-1), hill_cots) / (pow(cots_pred(t-1), hill_cots) + pow(h_cots + epsilon, hill_cots))
- This modification allows for sharper transitions in predation efficiency as COTS abundance increases, improving the model's ability to capture abrupt outbreak onsets and collapses.

No current time step observed data is used in prediction calculations, maintaining proper temporal structure.
