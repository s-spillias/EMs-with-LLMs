Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, with process equations that predict each time step based on previous states. Without the residuals file, a quantitative assessment is not possible, but the structure is appropriate for time series fitting.
2. Project Context: The model captures key features of COTS outbreaksâ€”boom-bust cycles, outbreak triggers, and selective predation on coral groups. Outbreaks are triggered by environmental forcing (larval input, temperature), and COTS population growth is amplified during outbreaks. Coral groups are modeled with logistic growth and selective predation.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model currently uses a saturating (Hill-type) functional response for COTS predation on coral, and logistic growth for both COTS and coral. However, the model does not explicitly include direct competition between fast and slow coral groups for space, which is ecologically important on reefs and can strongly influence recovery after COTS outbreaks. Currently, both coral groups are limited by the sum of their covers in their logistic terms, but there is no explicit asymmetric competition or differential suppression.

Chosen Improvement:
I will add an explicit asymmetric competition term between fast and slow coral groups. This will allow, for example, fast-growing Acropora to suppress the recovery of slow-growing corals (Faviidae, Porites) after disturbance, reflecting field observations. This is ecologically justified because space competition is a key process structuring coral communities, especially after COTS outbreaks when fast growers can dominate and inhibit slow coral recovery.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: "competition_coef_fast_on_slow" (effect of fast coral on slow coral growth).
- In the slow coral equation, subtract an additional term: competition_coef_fast_on_slow * fast_pred(t-1) * slow_pred(t-1) / K_slow.
- This term represents asymmetric competition, where fast coral suppresses slow coral more than vice versa.
- Document the new parameter in parameters.json with ecological justification.

This improvement adds a key feedback mechanism and is supported by reef ecology literature.
