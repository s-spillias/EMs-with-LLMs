This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their selective predation on coral communities (fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp.). The model predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions by integrating key ecological processes: (1) COTS population dynamics driven by larval immigration, density-dependent survival, and resource (coral) limitation; (2) selective predation by COTS on coral functional groups, with feedbacks from coral depletion to COTS success; (3) environmental modulation of rates (e.g., temperature effects on COTS recruitment); and (4) indirect effects and feedbacks, such as coral recovery and competitive interactions. Resource limitation is modeled using saturating and threshold functions to capture nonlinearities in outbreak dynamics. All equations are constructed to avoid numerical instability and ensure robust prediction of outbreak events and coral community responses.
