Intention: 
This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their interactions with two coral functional groups: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. The model is designed to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions (boom-bust cycles) and their cascading effects on coral cover. 

Key ecological processes include:
- Density-dependent COTS recruitment and mortality, with outbreak triggers linked to larval supply and environmental conditions (e.g., sea-surface temperature).
- Resource limitation via saturating (Michaelis-Menten) functional responses for COTS predation on coral, with process-specific feeding efficiencies.
- Feedbacks from coral depletion on COTS population collapse (bust phase).
- Environmental modulation of rates (e.g., temperature effects on COTS survival/recruitment).
- Indirect effects: COTS outbreaks reduce coral cover, which in turn limits future COTS population growth.
- All transitions are smooth and numerically stable, with small constants to avoid division by zero and smooth penalties for parameter bounds.

The model predicts annual time series of COTS abundance and coral cover, using observed environmental drivers and larval immigration as inputs. It is intended for scenario analysis and forecasting of outbreak dynamics under varying environmental and management conditions.
