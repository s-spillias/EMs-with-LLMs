This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. corals. COTS population dynamics are driven by density-dependent processes, resource limitation (coral cover), and episodic larval immigration events. Outbreaks are triggered by pulses of larval supply and sustained by high coral availability, but are ultimately limited by resource depletion and feedbacks from coral loss. The model incorporates saturating functional responses for predation, environmental modulation of rates (e.g., temperature effects), and smooth penalties to ensure parameters remain within biologically meaningful ranges. Observed data on COTS abundance and coral cover are used to fit the model, with likelihoods designed for numerical stability and ecological realism. The model is intended for forecasting future COTS outbreaks and coral community trajectories under varying environmental and management scenarios.
