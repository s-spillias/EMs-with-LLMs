This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. corals. COTS population dynamics are driven by density-dependent processes, resource limitation (coral cover), and episodic larval immigration, with environmental factors (e.g., sea surface temperature) modulating key rates. Outbreaks are triggered by pulses of larval immigration and sustained by high coral availability, but collapse as coral is depleted and/or natural mortality increases. The model incorporates saturating and threshold effects, process-specific efficiencies, and feedbacks between COTS and coral communities. All ecological processes are formulated to ensure numerical stability and biological realism, enabling robust prediction of COTS outbreaks and their impacts on coral assemblages.
