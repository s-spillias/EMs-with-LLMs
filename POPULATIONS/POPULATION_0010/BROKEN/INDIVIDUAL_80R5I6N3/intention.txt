This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. corals. COTS population dynamics are driven by larval immigration, density-dependent survival, and resource limitation, with outbreak events triggered by favorable environmental conditions (e.g., elevated larval supply or temperature). Coral cover is reduced by selective predation from COTS and recovers via growth, subject to resource competition and environmental modification. The model incorporates feedbacks: COTS outbreaks deplete coral resources, which in turn limit future COTS population growth. Environmental variables (e.g., sea-surface temperature) modulate key rates, and all processes are formulated to ensure numerical stability and ecological realism. The model is designed for robust prediction of future ecosystem states given initial conditions and environmental forcing.
