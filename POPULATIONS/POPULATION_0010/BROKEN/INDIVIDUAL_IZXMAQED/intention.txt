This model simulates episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their interactions with coral communities. The model predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions, accounting for selective predation on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) corals. Outbreaks are triggered and sustained by a combination of larval immigration, environmental drivers (e.g., sea-surface temperature), and resource availability, with feedbacks between COTS abundance and coral cover. Resource limitation is modeled using saturating and threshold functions, and process-specific efficiencies are included for predation and coral recovery. Environmental conditions modify key rates, and indirect effects (e.g., coral depletion reducing future COTS success) are incorporated. The model is designed for robust prediction of future ecosystem states, using only lagged (previous time step) values of state variables to avoid data leakage.
