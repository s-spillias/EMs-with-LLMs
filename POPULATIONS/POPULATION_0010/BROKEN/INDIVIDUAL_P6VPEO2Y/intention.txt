This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites corals. COTS population dynamics are driven by density-dependent processes, resource limitation, and environmental forcing (e.g., larval immigration and temperature effects). Outbreaks are triggered by episodic increases in larval supply and/or favorable environmental conditions, with feedbacks from coral depletion and resource limitation leading to subsequent population crashes. The model incorporates saturating and threshold effects in predation and recruitment, process-specific efficiencies, and smooth penalties to ensure numerical stability and biologically realistic parameter ranges. Predictions are made for COTS abundance and coral cover, capturing the characteristic outbreak cycles and their ecological consequences.
