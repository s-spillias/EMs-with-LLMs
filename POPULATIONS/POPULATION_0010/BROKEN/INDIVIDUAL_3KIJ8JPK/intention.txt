This model simulates episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their interactions with coral communities (fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp.). The model predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks by capturing key ecological processes: (1) COTS population dynamics driven by density-dependent recruitment, resource limitation, and environmentally-modified larval immigration; (2) selective predation by COTS on coral functional groups, with feedbacks from coral depletion affecting COTS survival and outbreak sustainability; (3) coral recovery and competition, with resource limitation and environmental stressors influencing regrowth rates. Outbreaks are triggered by episodic increases in larval supply and/or favorable environmental conditions, and sustained by positive feedbacks until resource depletion or increased mortality causes collapse. The model incorporates saturating and threshold effects, smooth transitions, and process-specific efficiencies, and is designed for robust prediction of future ecosystem states given initial conditions and environmental forcing.
