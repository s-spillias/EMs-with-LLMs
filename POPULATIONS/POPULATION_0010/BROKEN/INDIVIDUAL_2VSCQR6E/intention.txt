This model simulates episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model predicts the abundance of adult COTS and the cover of two coral groups: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. It incorporates:

- Resource limitation of COTS by coral cover, using saturating (Type II) functional responses to reflect selective predation and handling time.
- Outbreak triggers via episodic larval immigration, modulated by environmental drivers (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval supply).
- Feedbacks: COTS predation reduces coral cover, which in turn limits future COTS population growth.
- Environmental modification of key rates (e.g., temperature effects on COTS survival and coral growth).
- Smooth transitions and soft parameter bounds for numerical stability.
- All predictions are based only on previous time step states to avoid data leakage.

The model is designed for robust likelihood-based inference using time series data on COTS abundance and coral cover, with lognormal error structures and minimum standard deviations to ensure numerical stability.
