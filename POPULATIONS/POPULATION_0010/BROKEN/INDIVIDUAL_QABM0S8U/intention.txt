This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. corals. COTS population dynamics are driven by density-dependent processes, resource limitation, and environmental forcing (e.g., larval immigration, temperature). Outbreaks are triggered by episodic increases in larval supply and/or favorable environmental conditions, and are sustained or terminated by feedbacks such as prey depletion and resource limitation. Coral cover is reduced by selective predation from COTS, with different vulnerability for fast- and slow-growing corals, and recovers via growth processes subject to resource and environmental constraints. The model incorporates saturating and threshold effects, process-specific efficiencies, and smooth transitions to ensure numerical stability. All predictions are made using only information from previous time steps to avoid data leakage, and the model is designed for robust likelihood-based inference using observed time series of COTS and coral cover.
