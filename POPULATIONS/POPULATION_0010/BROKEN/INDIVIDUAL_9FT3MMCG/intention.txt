This model simulates episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. coral groups. COTS population dynamics are driven by density-dependent processes, resource limitation, and environmental forcing (e.g., larval immigration and temperature effects). Outbreaks are triggered by episodic increases in larval supply and/or favorable environmental conditions, with feedbacks from coral depletion and resource competition regulating outbreak duration and collapse. The model incorporates saturating and threshold effects in predation and recruitment, process-specific efficiencies, and environmental modifiers. All ecological processes are formulated to ensure numerical stability and biological realism, enabling robust prediction of COTS outbreaks and their impacts on coral communities.
