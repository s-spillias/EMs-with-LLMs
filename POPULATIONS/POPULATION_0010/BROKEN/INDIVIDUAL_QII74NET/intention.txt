Intention: 
This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) coral groups. 

Key ecological processes include:
1. COTS population dynamics driven by density-dependent survival, resource (coral) limitation, and episodic larval immigration events.
2. Coral community dynamics, with selective predation by COTS, differential recovery rates, and competition for space.
3. Environmental forcing (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval supply) modulating demographic rates and outbreak triggers.
4. Feedbacks: COTS outbreaks reduce coral cover, which in turn limits future COTS population growth.
5. Resource limitation is modeled using saturating (Michaelis-Menten) and threshold-type functions to capture nonlinearities in predation and recruitment.
6. All processes are formulated to ensure numerical stability and biological realism, with smooth transitions and penalties for parameter bounds.

The model is designed for robust prediction of COTS and coral trajectories under varying environmental and management scenarios, and is suitable for fitting to time series data of COTS abundance and coral cover.
