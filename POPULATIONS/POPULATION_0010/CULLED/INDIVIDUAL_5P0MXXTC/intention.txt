Assessment:
1. The current model captures the main processes of COTS outbreaks and coral predation, but the predation term uses a simple saturating (Holling Type II) response. This may not fully capture the explosive, threshold-like increases in coral mortality observed during real COTS outbreaks.
2. The model addresses the project context by including outbreak triggers, resource limitation, and selective predation, but may underpredict the rapidity and severity of coral loss during outbreaks.
3. A key ecological process that may be oversimplified is the relationship between COTS density and predation impact on coral. Empirical studies suggest that coral mortality accelerates nonlinearly once COTS densities surpass a threshold, consistent with a Hill-type (sigmoidal) functional response.

Chosen improvement:
- Replace the current Holling Type II predation efficiency with a Hill-type (sigmoidal) functional response, introducing a new parameter 'hill_n_cots' (Hill coefficient).
- This allows predation rates to remain low at sub-outbreak COTS densities but increase sharply once a threshold is crossed, better capturing the characteristic boom-bust outbreak dynamics and their impact on coral.
- The added complexity is justified by the need to accurately model the nonlinear, threshold-driven nature of COTS outbreaks and their disproportionate impact on coral communities.
