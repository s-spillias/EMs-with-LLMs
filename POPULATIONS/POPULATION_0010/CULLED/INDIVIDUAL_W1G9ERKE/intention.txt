Assessment:
- The current model captures COTS boom-bust cycles, outbreak triggers, and selective/saturating predation on coral.
- However, it assumes fixed predation efficiency, which may overestimate coral loss at high COTS densities and does not account for interference or satiation.
- Ecological studies suggest that at high COTS densities, per capita predation rates decline due to crowding/interference.

Improvement:
- Added a COTS density-dependent predation efficiency (Holling Type II functional response) by introducing a half-saturation constant (h_cots).
- This allows predation on coral to saturate at high COTS densities, reflecting interference/satiation and improving realism during outbreaks.
- The new parameter (log_h_cots) is justified ecologically and mathematically, and is implemented in the predation terms for both COTS and coral equations.
