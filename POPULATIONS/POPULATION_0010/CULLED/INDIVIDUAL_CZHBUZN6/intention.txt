Assessment:
- The current model captures the main features of COTS outbreaks, including boom-bust cycles, outbreak triggers, and selective predation on coral groups.
- However, the feedback from coral depletion to the collapse of COTS outbreaks is only implicit via resource limitation in COTS growth. The outbreak state can persist even when coral is nearly exhausted, which may not reflect the rapid collapse of outbreaks observed in nature.

Improvement:
- I introduce a direct negative feedback from coral depletion to outbreak persistence. When total coral cover (fast + slow) drops, the outbreak state decays more rapidly, reflecting the ecological reality that COTS outbreaks cannot be sustained without sufficient prey.
- This is implemented by multiplying the outbreak persistence term by a saturating function of total coral cover, so that low coral cover accelerates outbreak collapse.
- This change should improve the model's ability to capture the timing and abruptness of outbreak bust phases, better matching observed boom-bust cycles.

Ecological justification:
- Outbreaks of COTS are sustained only while sufficient coral prey is available. When coral cover drops below a threshold, outbreaks collapse rapidly. This feedback is well-documented in the literature and is critical for realistic modeling of COTS population dynamics.
