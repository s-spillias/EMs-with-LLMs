Assessment:
- The current model captures key features of COTS outbreaks: boom-bust cycles, outbreak triggers, and selective predation on coral types.
- Outbreaks are triggered by environmental forcing (larval input, temperature), but the model does not include feedback from coral availability to outbreak probability.
- In reality, COTS outbreaks are less likely or less severe when coral cover is low, as larvae require coral for settlement and survival.
- The model may overpredict outbreak frequency or magnitude when coral is depleted, missing this important ecological feedback.

Improvement:
- Add a feedback from coral availability to the outbreak trigger by multiplying the outbreak probability by a saturating function of coral availability.
- This ensures that outbreaks are less likely or less intense when coral cover is low, better matching observed boom-bust cycles and ecological reality.
- Implement this by introducing a new parameter (log_kappa_outbreak) controlling the sensitivity of outbreak probability to coral cover, and modifying the outbreak trigger accordingly.

Ecological justification:
- Outbreaks require sufficient coral for COTS larvae to settle and survive. When coral is depleted, outbreaks are naturally suppressed.
- This feedback is well-supported in the literature and improves the model's ability to capture the timing and magnitude of outbreaks.
