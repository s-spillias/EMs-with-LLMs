Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and includes process-based predictions for each. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here. The structure suggests reasonable mechanistic fit, but the outbreak dynamics and coral recovery may be overly simplified.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model captures key features of COTS outbreaks (boom-bust cycles, outbreak triggers, selective predation, and coral group competition). Outbreaks are triggered by environmental forcing (larval input, temperature), and COTS predation is selective. However, the feedback from coral depletion to COTS population collapse may be too weak, and the outbreak termination mechanism is mainly duration-based, not resource-based.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model uses a Holling Type II (saturating) functional response for COTS predation, but COTS population collapse after outbreaks is not strongly tied to coral depletion. In reality, severe coral depletion can cause rapid COTS decline due to starvation/resource exhaustion, a key feedback for realistic boom-bust cycles.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
- Add a strong resource-limitation feedback on COTS population growth: Implement a non-linear (sigmoidal) decline in COTS growth rate when total coral cover (fast + slow) falls below a critical threshold. This mimics starvation-driven collapse and sharpens the bust phase of outbreaks, better matching observed dynamics and the project context. This is ecologically justified as COTS require sufficient live coral to sustain high densities, and outbreaks typically crash when coral is depleted.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: logit_theta_collapse (steepness/threshold for COTS collapse at low coral cover).
- Modify the COTS growth term so that when total coral cover drops below a threshold (e.g., 5%), COTS growth rate is rapidly suppressed.
- This adds a biologically realistic, non-linear feedback, improving the timing and magnitude of outbreak collapses.
