Assessment:
- The current model captures COTS boom-bust cycles and selective coral predation, but outbreak amplification is not limited by coral availability. This can lead to unrealistic persistence of outbreaks even when coral is depleted, and may not reproduce the sharp crash and slow recovery phases observed in real systems.
- Key ecological process missing: feedback from coral depletion to COTS outbreak intensity. In reality, COTS outbreaks cannot be sustained when coral cover is low due to food limitation.

Improvement:
- Add a resource limitation feedback: Outbreak amplification is scaled by a saturating function of total coral cover (fast + slow coral). This ensures that outbreaks cannot persist when coral is depleted, producing more realistic bust and recovery dynamics.
- New parameter: log_kappa_coral (log coral cover at which outbreak amplification is half-maximal).
- Mathematical form: outbreak_boost = outbreak_state(t) * (total_coral / (total_coral + kappa_coral)), where total_coral = fast_pred(t-1) + slow_pred(t-1).

Ecological justification:
- COTS require sufficient coral prey to sustain outbreaks. When coral is depleted, COTS populations should crash and outbreaks should not persist. This feedback is supported by field observations and literature.
