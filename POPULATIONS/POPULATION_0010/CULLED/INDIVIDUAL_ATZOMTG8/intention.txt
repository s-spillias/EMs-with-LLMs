Assessment:
- The current model captures the main features of COTS outbreaks: boom-bust cycles, outbreak triggers, and selective predation on coral groups.
- However, the feedback from coral depletion to COTS population collapse is oversimplified. There is no explicit mechanism for rapid COTS mortality when coral is severely depleted, which is a key ecological process driving the abrupt end of outbreaks.
- The model lacks a starvation mortality term for COTS that increases sharply when coral availability is low.

Ecological improvement:
- I am adding a starvation mortality term for COTS that increases rapidly as coral availability declines. This introduces a strong negative feedback: when COTS overexploit coral, their own population crashes due to lack of food.
- This mechanism is ecologically justified, as observed COTS outbreaks often end abruptly when coral cover is depleted, leading to mass mortality of starfish.
- The improvement is implemented as an additional mortality term in the COTS population equation, parameterized by a maximum starvation rate and a half-saturation constant for coral availability.

Parameters added:
- log_max_starv_cots: log maximum starvation mortality rate for COTS (year^-1)
- log_starv_half_sat: log half-saturation constant for starvation mortality (same units as coral_avail)

This change should improve the model's ability to reproduce the timing and abruptness of COTS population crashes following coral depletion, better matching observed boom-bust dynamics.
