Assessment:
- The current model captures COTS outbreaks and selective predation on coral, with environmental triggers and logistic growth for both COTS and coral groups.
- However, the COTS population growth is only limited by its own density (logistic), not directly by coral availability. In reality, COTS numbers should crash more sharply when coral is depleted after an outbreak, due to resource limitation.
- This feedback is important for reproducing the characteristic boom-bust cycles observed in the field.

Improvement:
- Modify the COTS logistic growth term so that the carrying capacity (K_cots) is scaled by available coral resource (weighted sum of fast and slow coral).
- This ensures that when coral is depleted, COTS cannot sustain high numbers, leading to a more realistic bust phase.
- No new parameters are required; the effect is mediated by existing selectivity and carrying capacity parameters.

Ecological justification:
- COTS require live coral for food and recruitment. When coral cover is low, COTS populations should decline rapidly.
- This resource limitation is a key feedback in outbreak dynamics and is supported by field observations.

Implementation:
- In model.cpp, replace the COTS logistic growth term with a resource-limited version where K_cots is scaled by coral availability.
