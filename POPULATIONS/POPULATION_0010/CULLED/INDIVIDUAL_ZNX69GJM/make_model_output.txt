   The model uses lognormal likelihoods for observed COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, with process equations for each. Without the residuals file, I cannot quantitatively assess fit, but the structure is appropriate for time series with positive values and log-scale variability.

 3 Missing or Oversimplified Processes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
   A key ecological process that may be oversimplified is the resource limitation on COTS population growth. Currently, COTS predation on coral is modeled as a saturating function, but the COTS population growth rate itself is not directly limited by coral availability—only by its own density (logistic growth). In reality, when coral cover is low, COTS recruitment and     
   survival should be reduced, leading to sharper busts after outbreaks.

To better capture the bust phase and feedbacks, I propose modifying the COTS logistic growth term so that the carrying capacity (K_cots) is scaled by available coral resource. This means that when coral is depleted, the COTS population cannot sustain high numbers, leading to a more realistic crash after outbreaks.

This ensures that as coral declines, the effective carrying capacity for COTS also declines, producing more realistic boom-bust cycles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

No new parameters are needed; the effect is mediated by existing parameters.

 - The current model captures COTS outbreaks and selective predation on coral, with environmental triggers and logistic growth for both COTS and coral groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 - However, the COTS population growth is only limited by its own density (logistic), not directly by coral availability. In reality, COTS numbers should crash more sharply when coral is depleted after an outbreak, due to resource limitation.                                                                                                                                     
 - This feedback is important for reproducing the characteristic boom-bust cycles observed in the field.

 - Modify the COTS logistic growth term so that the carrying capacity (K_cots) is scaled by available coral resource (weighted sum of fast and slow coral).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 - This ensures that when coral is depleted, COTS cannot sustain high numbers, leading to a more realistic bust phase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 - No new parameters are required; the effect is mediated by existing selectivity and carrying capacity parameters.

 - COTS require live coral for food and recruitment. When coral cover is low, COTS populations should decline rapidly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 - This resource limitation is a key feedback in outbreak dynamics and is supported by field observations.

 1. Outbreak trigger: Outbreaks are probabilistically triggered by environmental forcing (larval input, temperature), with smooth transitions and mean duration tau_outbreak.
