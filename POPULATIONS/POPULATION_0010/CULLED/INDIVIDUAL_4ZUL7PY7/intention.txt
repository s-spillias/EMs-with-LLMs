Assessment:
- The current model captures key features of COTS outbreaks: nonlinear outbreak triggers, resource-limited growth, selective predation, and environmental forcing.
- It addresses the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks, and includes boom-bust cycles and coral group selectivity.
- However, the model does not include temperature dependence of COTS predation efficiency, which is ecologically important as COTS feeding rates increase with temperature.

Improvement:
- Add temperature dependence to COTS predation efficiency.
- This is justified because COTS feeding and metabolism are known to be temperature-sensitive, and warmer conditions can amplify coral mortality during outbreaks.
- Implementation: Introduce a parameter for temperature sensitivity of COTS predation, and multiply the predation efficiency by an exponential function of temperature anomaly (relative to 28Â°C).
- This adds a realistic environmental feedback, improving the model's ability to capture the magnitude and timing of coral loss during outbreaks.
