You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

 This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites   
 spp.) coral groups. COTS population dynamics are driven by density-dependent processes, resource limitation, and environmental forcing (e.g., larval immigration, temperature). Coral cover is reduced by selective predation from COTS, with recovery governed by intrinsic growth rates and resource competition. The model incorporates feedbacks such as coral depletion limiting 
 future COTS outbreaks, and environmental modifiers that can trigger or sustain outbreaks. All processes are formulated to ensure numerical stability and ecological realism, enabling robust prediction of future ecosystem states.

Search results found for log_r_cots
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) has a high intrinsic growth potential that can lead to rapid population outbreaks, causing widespread damage to coral reef ecosystems.

The first search result indicates that CoTS have "intrinsic growth rates following different disturbance types" (Pratchett et al., 2009). This suggests that CoTS populations can increase rapidly, especially after disturbances that may reduce their natural predators or competitors.

The second search result further supports this, noting that if coral cover is below 40%, a CoTS density of just 0.04 individuals per minute can lead to a 0-5% increase in fast-growing coral cover (Uthicke et al., 2024). This highlights the high growth potential of CoTS populations and their ability to quickly overwhelm and damage coral reef ecosystems.

The third search result emphasizes that CoTS population outbreaks can "devastate a coral reef in a matter of months (Pratchett et al., 2009) or even as short as one month" (Pratchett et al., 2023). This underscores the rapid and destructive nature of CoTS population explosions.

In summary, the search results indicate that the crown-of-thorns starfish has a high intrinsic growth potential, which can lead to rapid population outbreaks that can devastate coral reef ecosystems in a matter of months or even weeks. This highlights the importance of understanding and managing CoTS populations to protect these valuable marine habitats.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) is a major predator of coral reefs, and its population outbreaks can have devastating effects on coral ecosystems. The key findings from the search results are:

1. Predator removal hypothesis: The predator removal hypothesis suggests that a decrease in the abundance of COTS predators, such as certain fish species, is a primary cause of COTS population outbreaks (Endean, 1969; Pratchett et al., 2014).

2. Predation and mortality: COTS have few natural predators as adults, but high mortality rates of the larvae and small starfish help control their populations under normal conditions (Reef Resilience Network, 2003).

3. Contribution to outbreaks: COTS life-history traits, such as rapid growth, high fecundity, and ability to survive starvation, contribute to their potential for population outbreaks (Pratchett et al., 2014).

In summary, the search results indicate that the removal or decline of COTS predators, combined with the species' own life-history characteristics, can lead to population outbreaks that result in extensive coral consumption and damage to reef ecosystems.

While the search results discuss Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) predation on coral reefs, they do not provide a specific numerical value for the predation rate in m2/indiv/year. The text describes COTS predation qualitatively, discussing population dynamics, outbreaks, and ecological impacts, but does not include a quantitative measurement of predation rate per individual per square meter per year.

To obtain this specific numerical value, additional research or more detailed scientific sources would be needed that directly measure COTS predation rates.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, several key points can be made about the population regeneration and recovery rate of fast-growing coral species:

1. Certain coral species, such as Acropora microphthalma, Acropora austera, Hydnophora rigida, and Montipora foliosa, have been shown to exhibit fast growth rates, exceeding 2.87 cm2 per month (Sheppard et al., 2002).

2. The recovery potential of coral populations is influenced by the size of the coral colonies impacted. Disturbances that affect smaller coral colonies tend to allow for quicker and more complete recovery of both coral and fish populations (Holbrook et al., 2022).

3. Even in cases where coral populations exhibit negative population growth, natural recovery processes can still lead to increases in coral cover over time. One study found that coral cover increased from 1.1% to 20.2% despite negative population growth, suggesting that demographic factors other than population growth can drive recovery (Riegl & Purkis, 2015).

In summary, the regeneration and recovery rate of fast-growing coral species can be relatively rapid, with some species exhibiting growth rates exceeding 2.87 cm2 per month (Sheppard et al., 2002). The recovery potential is influenced by the size of the coral colonies impacted, with smaller colonies generally allowing for quicker and more complete recovery (Holbrook et al., 2022). Additionally, natural recovery processes can lead to increases in coral cover even in the face of negative population growth (Riegl & Purkis, 2015).

Search results found for log_r_slow
**************************************************

Based on the search results provided, slow-growing coral species can have a slow rate of population regeneration and recovery:

Slow-growing coral species, such as certain Alaskan coral species, can take up to 60 years to reach full size (NOAA, n.d.). This slow growth rate means that the recovery of coral populations after disturbances can also be very slow.

A study on coral recovery after a disturbance event found that while there was rapid and widespread recovery overall, reefs at deeper depths (17 m) recovered more slowly than shallower reefs (10 m) (Holbrook et al., 2022). This suggests that the early life stage of corals is a critical bottleneck that determines the rate of recovery.

Researchers have explored techniques like microfragmenting to try to speed up the restoration of slow-growing coral species. A study found that if predation events can be reduced, massive corals can be successfully grown and outplanted for restoration purposes (Lirman & Schopmeyer, 2016). This indicates that targeted restoration efforts may be able to accelerate the recovery of slow-growing coral populations.

In summary, the slow growth rates of certain coral species mean that their population regeneration and recovery after disturbances can be very gradual, taking decades in some cases. However, restoration techniques like microfragmenting show promise for enhancing the recovery of these slow-growing corals.
