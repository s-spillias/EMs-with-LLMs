This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents interactions between COTS and their coral prey, distinguishing between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) coral groups. COTS population dynamics are driven by density-dependent processes, resource limitation, and environmental forcing (e.g., larval immigration, temperature). Coral cover is reduced by selective predation from COTS, with recovery governed by intrinsic growth rates and resource competition. The model incorporates feedbacks such as coral depletion limiting future COTS outbreaks, and environmental modifiers that can trigger or sustain outbreaks. All processes are formulated to ensure numerical stability and ecological realism, enabling robust prediction of future ecosystem states.
