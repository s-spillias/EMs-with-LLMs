Assessment:
- The current model captures key features of COTS outbreaks (environmental triggers, nonlinear predation, selective coral predation, outbreak memory).
- However, it lacks a feedback mechanism where severe coral depletion limits COTS population recovery, which is ecologically observed after outbreaks.
- This omission may allow the model to overpredict COTS persistence or rapid rebound even when coral cover is very low.

Improvement:
- Add a negative feedback from low coral cover to COTS population growth, representing food limitation and recruitment failure when coral is scarce.
- Implement this by multiplying the COTS logistic growth term by a saturating function of total coral cover (Michaelis-Menten type).
- Add a new parameter: log_h_food (log half-saturation constant for COTS food limitation, in % coral cover).
- This change is ecologically justified and should improve the model's ability to capture the bust phase and recovery lag after severe outbreaks.
