Assessment:
- The current model captures key features of COTS outbreaks: environmental triggers, logistic growth, saturating predation, and selective coral predation.
- However, it lacks a strong feedback from coral depletion to COTS population dynamics, which is ecologically important for generating sharp busts after outbreaks.
- Specifically, when coral cover is severely reduced, COTS recruitment and survival should be strongly limited, leading to rapid population declines and delayed recovery.

Improvement:
- I am adding a non-linear, resource-dependent feedback on COTS population growth: when total coral cover drops below a threshold, COTS growth is sharply reduced.
- This is implemented by multiplying the COTS growth term by a sigmoid resource limitation function of total coral cover.
- This mechanism is ecologically justified, as COTS larvae and juveniles require sufficient coral for settlement and survival.
- The change should improve the model's ability to reproduce the characteristic boom-bust cycles and recovery lags observed in real COTS outbreaks.

Parameters:
- Added 'logit_coral_thresh' (logit of coral cover threshold for COTS recruitment limitation).
- The steepness parameter 'kappa' is fixed at 10 for a sharp transition.
