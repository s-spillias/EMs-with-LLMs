Assessment:
- The current model captures COTS outbreaks and boom-bust cycles via probabilistic outbreak triggers, resource limitation, and selective predation on coral groups.
- Environmental drivers (larval input, temperature) are included in the outbreak trigger.
- However, the feedback from coral depletion to COTS decline may be too weak, potentially leading to over-prediction of outbreak duration or magnitude.
- There is no explicit mechanism for increased COTS mortality when coral cover is low, which is ecologically plausible.

Improvement:
- Add a direct coral-dependent mortality term for COTS, increasing mortality as coral availability declines.
- This sharpens the bust phase of outbreaks and better captures rapid COTS declines after coral depletion, as observed in nature.
- Implementation: Add a new parameter (log_m_cots) for maximum COTS mortality rate, and subtract a mortality term in the COTS process proportional to the lack of coral resource.

Ecological justification:
- COTS experience increased mortality due to starvation and predation when coral cover is low (see Pratchett et al. 2014, "Limits to crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks: coral depletion and recruitment limitation").
- This feedback is essential for realistic boom-bust dynamics and is supported by field observations.
