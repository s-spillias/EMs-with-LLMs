Assessment:
1. The current model captures the main features of COTS outbreaks and selective coral predation, using logistic growth, saturating predation, and outbreak dynamics. However, it may overestimate the speed of coral recovery after outbreaks, as it does not account for recruitment limitation or Allee effects at low coral cover.
2. To better reflect ecological reality and improve fit to observed slow coral recovery after severe outbreaks, I am introducing a density-dependent coral recovery modifier. This will suppress coral growth at very low cover, mimicking recruitment limitation and substrate unsuitability, and allow recovery to accelerate only after a threshold is passed.
3. This change adds a sigmoidal modifier to the coral growth terms, controlled by a new parameter (logit_theta_recovery), which sets the threshold and steepness of the recovery response.

Change:
- Add parameter logit_theta_recovery to parameters.json (controls threshold for coral recovery).
- In model.cpp, multiply coral growth terms by a sigmoidal function of previous coral cover, so that recovery is suppressed at low cover and accelerates above a threshold.
- This improves the model's ability to capture slow post-outbreak coral recovery, a key feature of the system.
