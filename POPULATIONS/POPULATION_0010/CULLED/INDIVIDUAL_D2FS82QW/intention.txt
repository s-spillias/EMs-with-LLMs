Assessment:
- The current model captures the main features of COTS outbreaks and coral-coral interactions, including outbreak triggers, nonlinear predation, and logistic coral recovery.
- However, it may oversimplify coral recovery after severe depletion. In reality, coral recovery is often slow at low cover due to recruitment limitation (an Allee effect).
- The model does not currently include an Allee effect for coral, which is ecologically important for capturing slow recovery after major COTS outbreaks.

Improvement:
- Add an Allee effect to both fast and slow coral logistic growth terms. This reduces coral recovery rate at low cover, reflecting recruitment limitation and ecological inertia after severe depletion.
- Mathematically, multiply the logistic growth term by (X/(X+A)), where X is coral cover and A is a small positive Allee constant (new parameter, log_allee_fast and log_allee_slow).
- This change is justified by ecological studies showing that coral recovery is strongly limited at low cover due to reduced larval supply, settlement, and increased competition.
