 Assessment of Current Model:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and includes process-based predictions for each. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here. The structure is appropriate for capturing time series dynamics, but the fit should be checked for systematic bias, especially during outbreak peaks an 
 busts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 2. Addressing Project Context: The model includes key mechanisms for COTS outbreaks: environmental triggers (larval input, temperature), outbreak amplification (Hill function), resource limitation (coral availability), and selective predation on coral types. It captures boom-bust cycles and feedbacks between COTS and coral.                                                 
 3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: One key ecological process that may be oversimplified is the effect of coral community composition on COTS population growth. Currently, coral limitation is modeled as a saturating function of total weighted coral availability, but does not account for possible nonlinear or threshold effects of coral depletion on COTS recruitment and  
 survival. In reality, COTS larvae and juveniles may experience sharply reduced survival when coral cover falls below a critical threshold, leading to more abrupt busts after outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 To better capture the abrupt collapse of COTS populations following coral depletion (a hallmark of boom-bust cycles), I will introduce a nonlinear (Hill-type) coral limitation function on COTS growth. This will replace the current saturating function with a sigmoidal response, allowing for sharper transitions when coral availability drops below a threshold. This is       
 ecologically justified, as COTS recruitment and survival are known to be highly sensitive to coral cover, with strong nonlinearities at low coral abundance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Implementation:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 - Add a new parameter: hill_n_coral (Hill coefficient for coral limitation on COTS growth).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 - Replace the coral_limitation term in model.cpp with a Hill-type function: coral_limitation = pow(coral_avail, n_coral) / (pow(coral_avail, n_coral) + pow(kappa_coral, n_coral) + epsilon)                                                                                                                                                                                          
 - This change allows for more abrupt COTS busts when coral is depleted, improving the model's ability to reproduce observed outbreak dynamics.
