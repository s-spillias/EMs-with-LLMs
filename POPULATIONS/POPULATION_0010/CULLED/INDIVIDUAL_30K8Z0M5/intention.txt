Assessment:
- The current model captures many key processes for COTS outbreaks: outbreak triggers, resource limitation, and selective predation.
- However, the effect of coral availability on COTS growth is modeled as a simple saturating function, which may not capture the sharp, threshold-like response observed in real COTS outbreaks.
- Empirical evidence suggests that COTS population growth responds nonlinearly to coral cover, with a steep increase above a critical threshold.

Improvement:
- I propose replacing the linear saturating coral limitation term in the COTS growth equation with a Hill-type (sigmoidal) function.
- This introduces a new parameter, hill_n_coral, which controls the steepness of the response.
- Ecological justification: This allows the model to capture the threshold effect where COTS outbreaks only occur when coral cover is sufficiently high, improving the realism of boom-bust dynamics.

Implementation:
- Added parameter: hill_n_coral (Hill coefficient for coral limitation on COTS growth).
- Updated the COTS growth equation to use a Hill function for coral limitation.
- This change is minimal in code but adds important ecological realism and flexibility.
