Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and includes process-based predictions for each. Without the residuals file, a quantitative assessment is not possible, but the structure is appropriate for fitting time series data.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model captures key features of COTS outbreaks (boom-bust cycles, outbreak triggers, outbreak duration, resource limitation via coral availability, and selective predation). Outbreaks are triggered by environmental forcing (larval input, temperature), and COTS population growth is amplified during outbreaks.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The model currently uses a Holling Type II (saturating) functional response for COTS predation on coral, and logistic growth for both COTS and corals. However, the model does not explicitly account for feedback from coral depletion on future COTS outbreaks. In reality, severe coral depletion can suppress or delay subsequent outbreaks by reducing food availability, introducing a negative feedback loop that can help explain the observed spacing and magnitude of outbreaks.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
I will introduce a negative feedback mechanism where low coral cover reduces the probability or magnitude of future COTS outbreaks. This is ecologically justified: after a major outbreak, depleted coral cover should limit the potential for subsequent COTS population explosions until coral recovers. This feedback will be implemented by modifying the outbreak trigger probability to be a function of total coral cover (fast + slow), such that low coral cover suppresses outbreak initiation.

Mathematical Implementation:
- Modify the outbreak trigger probability (p_outbreak) to include a saturating function of total coral cover from the previous time step.
- Add a new parameter, "logit_coral_feedback", controlling the strength of this feedback (ecological justification: represents the threshold and steepness with which coral depletion suppresses outbreaks).
- This change adds only one parameter and a simple non-linear feedback, improving ecological realism without excessive complexity.

No data leakage will occur, as only previous time step values are used.
