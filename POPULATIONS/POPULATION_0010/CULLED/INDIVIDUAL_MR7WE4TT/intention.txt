Assessment:
- The current model captures the main features of COTS outbreaks and coral predation, using logistic growth, outbreak triggers, and selective predation.
- However, COTS population growth is only limited by its own density (logistic term) and not directly by coral availability, except via predation losses. This may allow COTS to grow unrealistically even when coral is depleted, which is ecologically implausible.

Improvement:
- I propose to introduce a saturating resource limitation on COTS population growth, so that COTS growth is strongly reduced when coral cover is low.
- This is implemented by multiplying the COTS logistic growth term by (coral_avail / (coral_avail + kappa_coral)), where coral_avail is the weighted sum of fast and slow coral, and kappa_coral is a new half-saturation parameter.
- This change is ecologically justified: COTS require sufficient coral for recruitment and survival, and outbreaks cannot be sustained if coral is depleted.
- This modification should improve the model's ability to capture the collapse of COTS populations following coral depletion, and better reproduce observed boom-bust cycles.

Parameter:
- Added parameter "log_kappa_coral" to parameters.json, representing the half-saturation constant for coral limitation on COTS growth.
