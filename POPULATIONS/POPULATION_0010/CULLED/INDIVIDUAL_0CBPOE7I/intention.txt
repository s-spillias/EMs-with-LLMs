Assessment:
- The current model captures COTS boom-bust cycles, outbreak triggers, and selective coral predation, but the feedback from coral depletion to COTS decline is likely too weak.
- Ecologically, COTS outbreaks collapse rapidly when coral is depleted, but the current resource limitation is a simple saturating function, which may not produce sharp busts.
- Residuals (see residuals file) likely show over-prediction of COTS abundance after coral cover is reduced, indicating insufficient feedback.

Improvement:
- Introduce a non-linear (Hill-type) resource limitation feedback in the COTS population growth and/or predation terms.
- This will sharply reduce COTS growth when coral cover is low, better capturing the rapid collapse of outbreaks due to resource exhaustion.
- Add a new parameter: hill_exponent (h), controlling the steepness of the resource limitation.
- Ecological justification: COTS require sufficient coral to sustain outbreaks; when coral is depleted below a threshold, COTS populations crash rapidly.

Implementation:
- Add "hill_exponent" parameter to parameters.json.
- In model.cpp, replace coral_avail/(coral_avail+1) with pow(coral_avail, h)/(pow(coral_avail, h) + 1), where h = exp(log_hill_exponent).
- Document all changes.
