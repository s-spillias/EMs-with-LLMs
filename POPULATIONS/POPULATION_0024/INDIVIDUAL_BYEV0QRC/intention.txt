MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Comprehensive predator-prey dynamics between COTS and two coral functional groups
- Temperature-dependent recruitment and coral stress mechanisms
- Allee effects capturing low-density reproductive failure
- Recruitment pulse mechanism for episodic outbreak initiation
- Prey preference and switching behavior

Potential Limitations:
1. The recruitment pulse mechanism (Equations 11-16) uses multiplicative combination of three favorability factors (temperature × immigration × substrate-food). This creates a very narrow window for outbreaks - all three must be simultaneously high.

2. The substrate-food favorability function (Equation 13) uses a fixed unimodal form: coral_ratio * exp(1 - coral_ratio). This peaks sharply at exactly optimal_coral with limited flexibility in shape.

3. Field observations show COTS outbreaks initiate across a range of coral covers (20-50%), not just at a single optimum. The current function may be too restrictive.

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT ===

Modification: Flexible Unimodal Substrate-Food Relationship

Replace the fixed unimodal function with a generalized beta-type distribution that provides:

1. **Adjustable width**: Control how broad the favorable coral cover range is
2. **Asymmetry**: Allow different rates of decline on either side of optimum
3. **Ecological realism**: Better match the observed variability in outbreak initiation conditions

Mathematical Form:
Instead of: coral_ratio * exp(1 - coral_ratio)
Use: ((coral/optimal)^shape1) * ((1 - coral/K_max)^shape2) / normalization_constant

Where:
- shape1 controls the left tail (low coral → optimum)
- shape2 controls the right tail (optimum → high coral)
- K_max is the maximum coral cover for normalization
- The function is normalized to peak at 1.0

Ecological Justification:
- Low shape parameters (0.5-1.5): Broad favorable range, outbreaks possible across wide coral cover spectrum
- High shape parameters (2-4): Narrow favorable range, outbreaks only at specific coral levels
- Asymmetric shapes: Can capture that outbreaks may be more common during coral recovery (increasing cover) than during decline

This maintains the core ecological principle that intermediate coral cover is optimal (balancing settlement substrate availability and post-settlement food) while adding the flexibility to match diverse field observations.

=== PARAMETER ADDITIONS ===

Two new shape parameters will be added:
1. substrate_food_shape1: Controls favorability increase from low to optimal coral
2. substrate_food_shape2: Controls favorability decrease from optimal to high coral

Both will have initial values around 1.5-2.0 (moderate specificity) with bounds allowing exploration of both broad (0.5) and narrow (4.0) favorable ranges.

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

- Better fit to outbreak timing across reefs with different coral cover trajectories
- More realistic representation of the variable conditions triggering outbreaks
- Maintained ecological realism of intermediate optimum
- Improved model flexibility without losing mechanistic interpretation
