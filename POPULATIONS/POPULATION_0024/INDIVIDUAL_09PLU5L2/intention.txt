MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Comprehensive COTS-coral predator-prey dynamics with two coral functional groups
2. Allee effects and temperature dependencies appropriately included
3. Type II functional responses capture predation saturation
4. Recruitment pulse mechanism (Equations 11-16) attempts to capture episodic outbreak initiation
5. Immigration effects and density-dependent mortality included

Structural Concerns:
1. Recruitment pulse uses steep threshold activation (Equation 15) creating abrupt on/off dynamics
2. Food favorability (Equation 13) is monotonically increasing with coral cover
3. Updated parameter values (especially log_mort_base with tight bounds 0.3-0.6 year⁻¹) suggest original equations may need refinement
4. Missing critical ecological feedback: substrate limitation for larval settlement

=== KEY MISSING ECOLOGICAL PROCESS ===

SUBSTRATE-LIMITED LARVAL SETTLEMENT:
- COTS larvae settle preferentially on crustose coralline algae (CCA) and bare substrate
- High coral cover reduces available settlement substrate by overgrowing CCA
- Low coral cover provides poor post-settlement food for juveniles
- Intermediate coral cover is OPTIMAL: sufficient settlement substrate + adequate food
- This creates a unimodal (hump-shaped) relationship between coral cover and recruitment success

Ecological Justification:
- Pratchett et al. (2014) show COTS settlement requires specific substrate conditions
- Outbreaks often initiate when coral cover is recovering (20-40%), not at maximum
- Very high coral cover (>60%) can suppress recruitment despite high food availability
- This mechanism helps explain outbreak timing and the characteristic boom-bust pattern

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Replace linear food favorability (Equation 13) with UNIMODAL SUBSTRATE-FOOD RELATIONSHIP:

OLD (Equation 13):
food_favorability = total_coral / (K_coral + eps)
- Monotonically increases with coral cover
- Maximum favorability at carrying capacity
- Ignores settlement substrate limitation

NEW (Modified Equation 13):
substrate_food_favorability = (total_coral / optimal_coral) * exp(1.0 - total_coral / optimal_coral)
- Peaks at optimal_coral (new parameter, ~30-40% cover)
- Declines at very low coral (poor food) AND very high coral (limited substrate)
- Unimodal curve captures settlement-survival tradeoff
- Mathematically: f(x) = (x/x_opt) * exp(1 - x/x_opt), maximum at x = x_opt

New Parameter Required:
- log_optimal_coral: Log of optimal coral cover for COTS recruitment
  * Initial value: 3.4 (log(30%) - intermediate coral cover)
  * Units: log(percent)
  * Bounds: 2.5 to 3.9 (12% to 50%)
  * Ecological range: Outbreaks typically initiate during coral recovery phase
  * Source: Literature on COTS settlement ecology

Expected Improvements:
1. More realistic outbreak timing (during recovery, not at peak coral)
2. Better capture of boom-bust cycles
3. Reduced sensitivity to threshold parameter
4. Improved model fit during inter-outbreak periods
5. Mechanistic explanation for why outbreaks don't occur at maximum coral cover

=== IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ===

Changes to model.cpp:
1. Add new parameter log_optimal_coral with transformation
2. Replace Equation 13 with unimodal substrate-food relationship
3. Update Equation 14 (composite favorability) to use new term
4. Maintain all other equations unchanged
5. Add REPORT for new parameter

Changes to parameters.json:
1. Add log_optimal_coral entry with ecological justification
2. Set appropriate bounds based on COTS settlement ecology
3. Priority level 2 (important for outbreak dynamics)

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding critical ecological realism for capturing episodic outbreak dynamics in the PROJECT CONTEXT.
