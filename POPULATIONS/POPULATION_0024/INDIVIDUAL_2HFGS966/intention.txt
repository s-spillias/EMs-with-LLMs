MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Comprehensive COTS-coral predator-prey framework
- Temperature effects on recruitment
- Immigration enhancement mechanism
- Type II functional responses with prey switching
- Recruitment pulse mechanism for outbreak initiation

Weaknesses Identified:
1. Recruitment pulse uses multiplicative favorability (temp × immigration × food) which is overly restrictive
2. Missing density-dependent recruitment facilitation at intermediate COTS densities
3. Lack of "sweet spot" dynamics that amplify outbreaks once initiated
4. Updated mortality parameters suggest need for refined density feedbacks

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: DOME-SHAPED RECRUITMENT FACILITATION ===

Rationale:
The PROJECT CONTEXT emphasizes "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" and "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events." Real COTS outbreaks exhibit characteristic dynamics where:

1. Initial recruitment is limited by Allee effects (low density)
2. Intermediate densities FACILITATE recruitment through:
   - Enhanced fertilization success via aggregation
   - Predator swamping (overwhelming natural predators)
   - Synchronized spawning events
3. Very high densities SUPPRESS recruitment through:
   - Larval competition and cannibalism
   - Resource depletion affecting juvenile survival
   - Density-dependent disease and stress

Mathematical Implementation:
Add a dome-shaped facilitation function that peaks at intermediate densities:

facilitation = exp(-0.5 * ((cots_prev - optimal_density) / density_width)^2)

This Gaussian-like function:
- Peaks at optimal_density (the "sweet spot" for outbreak amplification)
- Declines at both low and high densities
- Width controlled by density_width parameter
- Multiplies the recruitment pulse to modulate its effectiveness

New Parameters:
1. log_optimal_recruit_density: Log of COTS density where recruitment facilitation peaks
   - Initial value: 0.693 (untransformed: 2.0 individuals/m²)
   - Bounds: -0.5 to 1.5 (0.6 to 4.5 individuals/m²)
   - Justification: Intermediate between Allee threshold (0.2) and carrying capacity (5.0)

2. log_recruit_density_width: Log of density range over which facilitation operates
   - Initial value: 0.693 (untransformed: 2.0 individuals/m²)
   - Bounds: 0.0 to 1.5 (1.0 to 4.5 individuals/m²)
   - Justification: Should span a reasonable range around optimal density

Expected Outcomes:
- More realistic outbreak amplification once conditions are favorable
- Better capture of rapid population explosions characteristic of COTS outbreaks
- Natural suppression of recruitment at extreme densities preventing unrealistic dynamics
- Improved boom-bust cycle representation with sharper peaks and declines

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding critical non-linear dynamics that are well-supported by COTS ecology literature.
