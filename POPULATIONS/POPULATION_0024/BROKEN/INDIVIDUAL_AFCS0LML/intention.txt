Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) Outbreak Model with Coral Community Dynamics

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) on the Great Barrier Reef and their impacts on coral communities. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS populations rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline.

Key Ecological Processes:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (facilitating outbreak initiation)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival and recruitment success
   - External larval immigration from upstream reefs (episodic pulse events)
   - Density-dependent mortality increasing at high densities (resource limitation and disease)
   - Natural mortality from predation and senescence

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Two functional coral groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites)
   - Logistic growth with carrying capacity representing available substrate
   - Differential recovery rates reflecting life history strategies
   - Competition for space between coral groups

3. COTS-Coral Interactions:
   - Type II functional response for coral consumption (handling time limitation)
   - Preferential feeding on fast-growing Acropora when abundant
   - Switching to slow-growing corals when preferred prey depleted
   - Consumption rate scales with COTS abundance and coral availability

4. Environmental Forcing:
   - Sea surface temperature affects COTS recruitment success (optimal temperature window)
   - Temperature stress causes coral bleaching mortality (extreme high temperatures)
   - Larval immigration pulses trigger outbreak initiation

5. Outbreak Mechanisms:
   - Allee effects allow rapid population growth once threshold density exceeded
   - High coral cover (especially fast-growing) supports outbreak amplification
   - Immigration pulses seed populations that can explode under favorable conditions
   - Outbreaks self-limit through coral depletion and density-dependent mortality

The model uses lognormal observation error for all state variables to account for the multiplicative nature of ecological processes and the wide range of observed values. Initial conditions are set from the first year of observations to anchor predictions in observed system state.
