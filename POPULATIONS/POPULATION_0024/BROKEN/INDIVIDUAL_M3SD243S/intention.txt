Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) Outbreak Model for the Great Barrier Reef

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) and their impact on coral communities. The model captures:

1. COTS POPULATION DYNAMICS:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (aggregation benefits for reproduction)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival (warmer temperatures enhance larval development)
   - External larval immigration events that can trigger outbreaks
   - Natural mortality increasing with density (resource limitation, disease)
   - Boom-bust cycles driven by coral resource depletion

2. CORAL COMMUNITY DYNAMICS:
   - Two functional coral groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites)
   - Logistic growth with carrying capacity
   - Differential recovery rates (fast corals recover quickly, slow corals take decades)
   - Competition for space between coral types

3. COTS-CORAL INTERACTIONS:
   - Selective predation with Type II functional response (handling time limits consumption)
   - Preference for fast-growing Acropora corals (preferred prey)
   - Switch to slow-growing corals when Acropora depleted
   - Predation rate increases with COTS density (aggregative feeding)
   - Coral availability limits COTS population growth (resource-driven crashes)

4. ENVIRONMENTAL FORCING:
   - Sea surface temperature affects COTS recruitment success
   - Larval immigration pulses can initiate outbreak events
   - Temperature stress on corals (bleaching effects reduce growth)

5. OUTBREAK MECHANISMS:
   - Outbreaks triggered by: (a) favorable temperature conditions, (b) larval immigration, (c) sufficient coral resources
   - Outbreaks sustained by: high coral availability and continued recruitment
   - Population crashes occur when: coral resources depleted below threshold supporting COTS metabolism
   - Recovery phase: slow coral regrowth allows eventual COTS population recovery

The model uses differential equations to predict COTS abundance and coral cover over time, with parameters informed by ecological theory and empirical observations from the Great Barrier Reef.
