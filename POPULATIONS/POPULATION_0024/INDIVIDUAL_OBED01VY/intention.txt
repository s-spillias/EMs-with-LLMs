MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Comprehensive predator-prey dynamics between COTS and two coral types
2. Temperature effects on both COTS recruitment and coral stress
3. Allee effects capturing reduced reproduction at low densities
4. Immigration effects representing larval connectivity
5. Prey preference and switching behavior

Critical Weakness Identified:
The recruitment pulse mechanism (Equations 11-18) is ecologically unrealistic because it operates independently of the adult spawning stock. The current implementation allows massive recruitment events even when adult COTS populations are near zero, which violates fundamental reproductive biology.

In equation 18, recruitment_pulse is added directly to population change without any dependence on adult abundance:
  cots_change = cots_growth_adults + recruitment_pulse - mortality_total * cots_prev

This means favorable environmental conditions alone can generate outbreaks from essentially zero adults, which is biologically impossible.

=== PARAMETER VALUE ANALYSIS ===

Several parameters have been updated from literature with precise values:
- log_mort_base: -0.857 (0.42/year) with tight bounds [-1.204, -0.511]
- log_temp_opt: 3.3495 (28.4°C) with very tight bounds [28-29°C]

These precise, literature-derived values suggest the model structure is generally appropriate, but the recruitment mechanism needs refinement to match biological reality.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Ecological Mechanism: Spawning Stock-Dependent Recruitment Modulation

Justification:
Crown-of-Thorns starfish are broadcast spawners. Mass recruitment events require:
1. Favorable environmental conditions (temperature, food, larval supply) - ALREADY MODELED
2. Sufficient adult spawning stock to produce larvae - CURRENTLY MISSING

Real COTS outbreaks follow this sequence:
- Small resident population persists at low density
- Favorable conditions occur (warm water, high nutrients, coral availability)
- Adults spawn synchronously, producing massive larval output
- High larval survival under favorable conditions creates recruitment pulse
- Positive feedback: more recruits → more spawners → bigger pulses

The current model captures step 2-4 but ignores step 1, allowing outbreaks to materialize from near-zero populations.

Mathematical Implementation:
Add a spawning stock effect that modulates recruitment pulse intensity:

spawning_stock_effect = cots_prev^spawning_exponent / (spawning_halfsat^spawning_exponent + cots_prev^spawning_exponent)

This Hill function provides:
- Near-zero recruitment when adults are absent (biologically correct)
- Saturating effect so very high adult densities don't infinitely amplify recruitment
- Smooth transition controlled by spawning_halfsat (adult density giving 50% max effect)
- Exponent > 1 creates threshold-like behavior matching synchronized spawning

Modified recruitment calculation:
recruitment_pulse = recruit_max * recruit_activation * favorability_index * spawning_stock_effect

This maintains all existing environmental controls while adding the missing biological constraint.

Parameter Additions:
1. spawning_halfsat: Adult density (individuals/m²) at which spawning stock effect reaches 50% of maximum
   - Initial value: 0.5 individuals/m² (moderate density)
   - Bounds: [0.1, 2.0] - allows fitting to data
   
2. spawning_exponent: Controls steepness of spawning stock response
   - Initial value: 2.0 (cooperative/threshold-like spawning)
   - Bounds: [1.0, 4.0] - from linear to highly cooperative

Expected Outcomes:
1. Prevents spurious outbreaks when adult populations are depleted
2. Maintains episodic outbreak dynamics when conditions align
3. Creates more realistic recovery trajectories after population crashes
4. Better captures the boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS dynamics
5. Improves model fit during inter-outbreak periods

This is a minimal modification (one new equation, two parameters) that addresses a fundamental biological constraint while preserving all existing mechanisms.
