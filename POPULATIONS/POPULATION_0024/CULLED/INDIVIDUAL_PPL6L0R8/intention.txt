MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model includes sophisticated outbreak mechanisms:
- Allee effects, temperature dependence, immigration effects
- Recruitment pulse with composite favorability (temp × immigration × food)
- Dome-shaped density-dependent recruitment facilitation
- Type II functional responses with prey switching
- Separate fast and slow coral dynamics

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
The model captures many key processes but lacks demographic realism in how recruitment translates to outbreak dynamics. The recruitment pulse mechanism adds individuals directly to the reproducing/feeding population, but real COTS have a critical juvenile stage (0-6 months) that acts as a demographic bottleneck.

KEY MISSING PROCESS - STAGE STRUCTURE:
Real COTS outbreaks involve:
1. Cryptic juvenile stage (0-6 months) with high mortality, minimal feeding
2. Adult stage with reproduction and heavy coral predation
3. Food-dependent maturation creating feedback between coral availability and outbreak development
4. Time lags between favorable recruitment conditions and outbreak peaks

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT - TWO-STAGE POPULATION MODEL:
Add explicit juvenile (J) and adult (A) stages:

JUVENILES:
- Receive recruitment pulse inputs
- Higher baseline mortality than adults (juveniles more vulnerable)
- Minimal coral consumption (cryptic, small size)
- Mature to adults at food-dependent rate
- Density-dependent mortality in juvenile stage

ADULTS:
- Reproduce (contribute to recruitment via Allee, temperature effects)
- Heavy coral predation (existing functional responses)
- Lower mortality than juveniles
- Density-dependent mortality

MATURATION FUNCTION:
- Rate increases with coral availability (well-fed juveniles mature faster)
- Saturating response (maximum maturation rate at high food)
- Creates feedback: coral depletion slows recruitment to adult stage

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. TIME LAGS: Juvenile stage creates 0.5-1 year delay between recruitment pulse and feeding impact, better matching observed outbreak dynamics
2. DEMOGRAPHIC BOTTLENECK: Juvenile survival regulates outbreak magnitude independently of initial recruitment success
3. FOOD-DEPENDENT FEEDBACK: Coral depletion by adults slows juvenile maturation, contributing to boom-bust cycles
4. REALISTIC MORTALITY: Stage-specific mortality rates match COTS biology (juveniles 2-3× adult mortality)
5. OUTBREAK AMPLIFICATION: Successful juvenile cohorts can rapidly mature when food is abundant, creating explosive adult population growth

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Split cots_pred into cots_juv_pred and cots_adult_pred
- Recruitment pulse → juveniles only
- Maturation flux: juveniles → adults (food-dependent rate)
- Adult reproduction drives Allee effect, temperature response
- Only adults contribute significantly to coral predation
- Stage-specific mortality rates

NEW PARAMETERS:
- log_mort_juvenile: Higher mortality for cryptic juveniles
- log_maturation_rate: Base rate of juvenile→adult transition
- log_maturation_halfsat: Half-saturation for food-dependent maturation
- maturation_max_rate: Maximum maturation rate multiplier

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
1. More realistic time lags between favorable conditions and outbreak peaks
2. Enhanced boom-bust dynamics through stage-structured feedbacks
3. Better capture of outbreak duration (adults persist while juvenile recruitment declines)
4. Improved prediction of outbreak magnitude through demographic bottleneck
5. More accurate representation of coral-COTS feedback (adults deplete food, slowing juvenile maturation)

This improvement maintains all existing mechanisms (Allee, temperature, immigration, recruitment pulse, density facilitation) while adding critical demographic realism that is essential for accurately modeling episodic outbreak dynamics.
