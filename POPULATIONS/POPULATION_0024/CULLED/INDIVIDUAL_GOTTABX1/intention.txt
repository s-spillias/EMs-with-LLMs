MODEL ASSESSMENT:

The current model captures basic COTS-coral predator-prey dynamics with Allee effects and temperature sensitivity. However, it lacks a critical mechanism for triggering the episodic outbreaks characteristic of COTS on the Great Barrier Reef.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. The model has temperature-dependent recruitment but is missing nutrient-driven larval survival, which is the primary trigger for COTS outbreaks in the literature
2. The temp_opt parameter has been updated from literature (28.6°C), suggesting the temperature effect formulation should be refined
3. The Allee effect alone may not be sufficient to generate the explosive outbreak dynamics without an additional environmental trigger

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:

Added framework for a nutrient-mediated larval survival mechanism that will work synergistically with the Allee effect to trigger outbreaks. This improvement:

1. Prepared the model structure to accept nutrient forcing data (nutrient_dat) representing riverine nutrient inputs or chlorophyll-a as a proxy for larval food availability
2. Designed a saturating (Michaelis-Menten) response to nutrients that will multiply recruitment success when data becomes available
3. Will create a multiplicative interaction between nutrients, temperature, and Allee effects - all three must align for major outbreaks
4. Refined the temperature effect to be asymmetric (using different sensitivities above/below optimum)

CURRENT STATUS:
- Asymmetric temperature effect is ACTIVE and functional
- Nutrient effect is PREPARED but currently disabled (set to neutral multiplier of 1.0) until nutrient_dat is provided in the dataset
- Parameters nutrient_half_sat and nutrient_max_effect are included but not yet affecting model behavior

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- COTS outbreaks on the GBR are strongly correlated with flood events that deliver nutrients
- Nutrients enhance phytoplankton blooms that feed COTS larvae during their planktonic phase
- This creates the episodic, spatially-clustered outbreak pattern observed in nature
- The boom-bust cycle will emerge from: nutrient pulse → larval survival → Allee effect overcome → outbreak → coral depletion → population crash

PARAMETERS ADDED:
- nutrient_half_sat: Half-saturation constant for nutrient effect on larval survival (controls sensitivity to nutrient pulses) - ready for use when data available
- nutrient_max_effect: Maximum multiplicative effect of nutrients on recruitment (controls outbreak magnitude) - ready for use when data available
- temp_sensitivity_warm: Sensitivity to temperatures above optimum (ACTIVE - typically higher than cooling sensitivity)

NEXT STEPS:
Once nutrient_dat is added to the dataset, uncomment the nutrient effect calculation in model.cpp (Equation 2) to activate the full outbreak trigger mechanism.
