MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE
==========================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model attempts to capture COTS outbreak dynamics through a recruitment pulse mechanism (Equations 11-16) that activates when temperature, immigration, and food conditions simultaneously exceed thresholds. While conceptually sound, this approach has limitations:

1. INSTANTANEOUS RECRUITMENT: The current model treats larval recruitment as an immediate response to favorable conditions. In reality, COTS have a 2-4 week planktonic larval stage where larvae accumulate in the water column before settling.

2. OVERLY RESTRICTIVE THRESHOLD: The multiplicative favorability index (Equation 14) requires ALL three factors to be high simultaneously. This may miss outbreak scenarios where conditions are sequentially favorable (e.g., good spawning conditions followed by good settlement conditions).

3. NO TEMPORAL DECOUPLING: Real COTS outbreaks show characteristic lags between favorable environmental conditions and population explosions. The current model cannot capture this temporal storage effect.

4. PARAMETER UPDATES: Literature-updated parameters (log_temp_opt, log_mort_base) confirm the ecological realism of temperature and mortality processes, but the recruitment mechanism remains oversimplified.

RESIDUAL PATTERNS (if available):
The model likely shows:
- Difficulty capturing the sharp onset of outbreak events
- Underestimation of outbreak magnitude
- Poor prediction of outbreak duration and decline phase
- Mismatch in timing between environmental drivers and population response

KEY MISSING PROCESS:
-------------------
LARVAL POOL DYNAMICS - COTS have a planktonic larval stage that acts as a temporal buffer between spawning and recruitment. This creates the characteristic "boom" pattern where:
- Larvae accumulate during favorable spawning conditions (warm temperatures, high adult density)
- Larvae experience planktonic mortality (predation, advection, starvation)
- Settlement occurs when benthic conditions are suitable (coral food availability, substrate space)
- The larval pool can "wait" for optimal settlement windows

This temporal decoupling is THE key mechanism driving episodic outbreak dynamics.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
--------------------
Add an explicit LARVAL POOL state variable (larvae/m²) that:

1. LARVAL PRODUCTION (Spawning):
   - Temperature-dependent spawning success (optimal ~28°C, asymmetric tolerance)
   - Density-dependent fecundity (more adults = more larvae, with Allee effect at low density)
   - Immigration adds external larval supply
   - Equation: dL/dt += spawning_rate * adults * temp_effect * allee_effect + immigration

2. LARVAL MORTALITY:
   - Planktonic mortality (predation, starvation, advection losses)
   - Duration-dependent mortality (larvae have competency window)
   - Equation: dL/dt -= larval_mortality_rate * larvae

3. LARVAL SETTLEMENT (Recruitment):
   - Food-dependent settlement (larvae settle when coral food is abundant)
   - Space-limited settlement (substrate availability)
   - Competency threshold (minimum larval pool size for settlement)
   - Equation: settlement = settlement_rate * larvae * food_availability * space_availability

4. BENTHIC RECRUITMENT:
   - Settled larvae become juvenile COTS
   - Post-settlement survival depends on food availability
   - Equation: dC/dt += settlement * post_settlement_survival

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
------------------------
This modification directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT requirements:

✓ TIMING: Larval pool accumulation creates realistic lag between favorable conditions and outbreaks
✓ MAGNITUDE: Accumulated larvae can produce explosive recruitment events when settlement conditions align
✓ DURATION: Larval pool depletion through settlement and mortality naturally limits outbreak duration
✓ BOOM-BUST CYCLES: The storage-and-release dynamics of the larval pool generate characteristic population oscillations

The improvement maintains parsimony while adding essential realism. It replaces the abstract "recruitment pulse" with a mechanistic process grounded in COTS life history.

NEW PARAMETERS REQUIRED:
-----------------------
1. log_spawning_rate: Log per-capita larval production rate (larvae/adult/year)
   - Bounds: [0.0, 6.0] → [1, 400] larvae/adult/year
   - Justification: COTS females produce millions of eggs, but most die; effective rate much lower

2. log_larval_mortality: Log planktonic larval mortality rate (year⁻¹)
   - Bounds: [2.0, 5.0] → [7.4, 148] year⁻¹ (very high - larvae are vulnerable)
   - Justification: Planktonic larvae experience ~90-99% mortality over 2-4 week period

3. log_settlement_rate: Log maximum settlement rate from larval pool (year⁻¹)
   - Bounds: [-1.0, 2.0] → [0.37, 7.4] year⁻¹
   - Justification: Settlement occurs over days to weeks when conditions are favorable

4. settlement_food_threshold: Coral cover threshold for larval settlement (%)
   - Bounds: [5.0, 30.0]
   - Justification: Larvae need adequate food for post-settlement survival

5. post_settlement_survival: Survival rate of settled larvae to juvenile stage (dimensionless)
   - Bounds: [0.01, 0.3]
   - Justification: High post-settlement mortality is typical for marine invertebrates

6. larval_competency_threshold: Minimum larval pool for settlement to occur (larvae/m²)
   - Bounds: [0.001, 0.1]
   - Justification: Prevents spurious settlement from tiny larval pools

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
--------------------
- Larval pool is a new state variable tracked alongside COTS, fast coral, and slow coral
- Initial larval pool set to small positive value (e.g., 0.01 larvae/m²)
- Temperature effect on spawning uses asymmetric function (steeper decline above optimum)
- Settlement is multiplicative: requires BOTH adequate larvae AND adequate food
- Immigration now adds to larval pool rather than directly boosting adult recruitment
- The old recruitment_pulse mechanism is REPLACED by the larval settlement process

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
---------------------
1. Better capture of outbreak onset timing (lag between conditions and response)
2. More realistic outbreak magnitude (accumulated larvae → explosive settlement)
3. Natural outbreak termination (larval pool depletion + food limitation)
4. Improved prediction of inter-outbreak periods (time to rebuild larval pool)
5. Better representation of spatial connectivity (immigration affects larval pool)

This modification transforms the model from a phenomenological outbreak trigger to a mechanistic representation of COTS population dynamics grounded in their biphasic life history.
