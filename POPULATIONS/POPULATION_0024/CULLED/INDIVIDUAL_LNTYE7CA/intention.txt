MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements sophisticated outbreak dynamics with threshold-based recruitment (Hill function), Allee effects, temperature dependencies, and prey switching. The core outbreak mechanism (Equations 4-7) combines local reproduction and immigration with sigmoidal amplification, which is ecologically sound for capturing boom-bust cycles.

KEY LIMITATION IDENTIFIED:
Equation 6 (resource-dependent recruitment facilitation) uses a simple linear relationship between coral availability and recruitment success:
  coral_facilitation = total_coral / K_coral
  resource_effect = 1 - coupling + coupling * coral_facilitation

This linear scaling doesn't capture the ecological reality of juvenile COTS survival and settlement:
1. Juvenile COTS require a MINIMUM coral threshold to survive post-settlement
2. Above this threshold, recruitment success increases RAPIDLY (not linearly)
3. At high coral cover, recruitment saturates due to space/shelter limitations

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Research on COTS early life history shows:
- Newly settled juveniles (<1cm) have extremely high mortality without adequate coral food
- A critical coral cover threshold (~10-15%) is needed for juvenile survival
- Above this threshold, survival increases steeply as juveniles find shelter and food
- At very high coral cover (>50%), recruitment doesn't continue increasing linearly due to:
  * Limited settlement space on suitable substrate
  * Intraspecific competition among juveniles
  * Predation pressure in dense coral matrices

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
Replace the linear coral facilitation (Equation 6) with a SIGMOIDAL (logistic) function:
  resource_effect = 1 / (1 + exp(-resource_steepness * (total_coral - resource_threshold)))

This creates:
- Near-zero recruitment below the coral threshold
- Rapid increase in recruitment success above threshold
- Saturation at high coral cover

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
1. resource_threshold: Coral cover threshold for recruitment facilitation (~15% cover)
   - Below this, recruitment is severely limited regardless of larval supply
   - Represents minimum food/shelter requirements for juvenile survival
   
2. resource_steepness: Steepness of the sigmoidal response (~0.2)
   - Controls how sharply recruitment responds to coral availability
   - Higher values = sharper threshold, lower values = more gradual transition

PARAMETER REMOVED:
- resource_recruitment_coupling: No longer needed as the sigmoidal function inherently captures the strength of coral-recruitment dependency

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
1. More realistic outbreak initiation: Outbreaks require BOTH high larval supply AND sufficient coral cover
2. Better representation of outbreak collapse: As COTS deplete coral below threshold, recruitment crashes
3. Improved boom-bust dynamics: Sharp transitions between outbreak and non-outbreak states
4. More accurate recovery dynamics: Coral must recover above threshold before next outbreak can initiate

This modification maintains the model's ability to capture episodic outbreaks while adding ecological realism to the resource-recruitment relationship, which is critical for predicting outbreak timing and duration in the Great Barrier Reef context.
