MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Comprehensive predator-prey framework with Type II functional responses
- Temperature effects on COTS recruitment and coral stress
- Allee effects at low COTS densities
- Prey preference and switching between coral types
- Density-dependent mortality

Weaknesses Identified:
1. OUTBREAK DYNAMICS: The model lacks a strong mechanism to generate episodic, explosive outbreaks characteristic of COTS on the GBR. Current recruitment is continuous and relatively smooth.

2. LARVAL RECRUITMENT: Immigration is treated as a simple linear enhancement (Equation 3), but COTS outbreaks involve massive larval pulses that can trigger threshold-driven population explosions.

3. RESOURCE COUPLING: The link between coral availability and COTS recruitment success is weak. High coral cover should facilitate higher recruitment success (more food for settling larvae and juveniles).

4. PARAMETER UPDATES: log_mort_base now has tight bounds (0.3-0.4 year^-1), and log_temp_opt is precisely constrained at 28.5°C. These well-characterized values suggest the basic demographic rates are solid, but the outbreak triggering mechanism needs enhancement.

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: THRESHOLD-BASED RECRUITMENT AMPLIFICATION ===

Rationale:
COTS outbreaks on the GBR are episodic events characterized by:
- Sudden population explosions (10-100x increase over 1-2 years)
- Self-reinforcing dynamics during outbreak phase
- Threshold behavior where small changes in conditions trigger large population responses
- Strong dependence on larval supply from upstream reefs
- Resource availability (coral) facilitating recruitment success

The current linear immigration enhancement cannot generate these dynamics. Real outbreaks show sigmoidal growth patterns where recruitment accelerates once a threshold is crossed.

Proposed Mechanism:
Add a RECRUITMENT AMPLIFICATION FUNCTION that creates positive feedback during favorable conditions:

1. SIGMOIDAL RECRUITMENT RESPONSE: Replace linear immigration boost with a Hill-function-type response that has a threshold. Below threshold: weak recruitment. Above threshold: explosive recruitment.

2. RESOURCE-DEPENDENT RECRUITMENT: Tie recruitment success to coral availability. High coral cover = more food for juveniles = higher survival to adult stage.

3. COMBINED LARVAL SUPPLY METRIC: Create a composite index combining local reproduction (adult COTS × temperature effect) and external immigration, then apply sigmoidal transformation.

Mathematical Form:
recruitment_potential = (local_reproduction + immigration_weight × immigration)
recruitment_amplification = recruitment_potential^n / (threshold^n + recruitment_potential^n)
resource_facilitation = total_coral / (K_coral + eps)
effective_recruitment = base_recruitment × recruitment_amplification × resource_facilitation

Where:
- n (Hill coefficient) controls steepness of threshold response
- threshold determines the larval supply level needed to trigger outbreaks
- resource_facilitation ensures recruitment requires adequate coral resources

New Parameters:
1. recruitment_threshold: Larval supply threshold for outbreak initiation (individuals/m²/year)
2. recruitment_cooperativity: Hill coefficient controlling outbreak sharpness (dimensionless, typically 2-4)
3. immigration_weight: Relative importance of external vs local larval supply (dimensionless)
4. resource_recruitment_coupling: Strength of coral-recruitment feedback (dimensionless, 0-1)

Expected Outcomes:
- Generate episodic boom-bust cycles matching GBR observations
- Create threshold behavior where outbreaks occur only when multiple conditions align
- Maintain population at low levels between outbreaks
- Allow rapid population growth during favorable periods
- Couple outbreak dynamics to coral resource availability

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" and "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events."

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

The sigmoidal recruitment function will replace the simple immigration_boost in Equation 3 and modify Equation 11 (COTS population growth). The Allee effect and temperature effect will be retained but integrated into the recruitment_potential calculation. This creates a multi-factor threshold where outbreaks require:
1. Sufficient adult population (Allee effect satisfied)
2. Favorable temperature (near optimum)
3. High larval supply (immigration)
4. Adequate coral resources (food availability)

All four factors must align to trigger an outbreak, matching ecological observations.
