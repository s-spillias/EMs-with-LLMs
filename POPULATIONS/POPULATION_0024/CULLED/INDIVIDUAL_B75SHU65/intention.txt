MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Implements predator-prey dynamics between COTS and two coral functional groups
- Includes Allee effects for low-density COTS dynamics
- Temperature-dependent recruitment and coral stress
- Prey preference and switching behavior
- Density-dependent mortality

Limitations for Capturing Outbreak Dynamics:
1. Missing episodic recruitment trigger mechanism
2. Immigration effect is linear rather than threshold-based
3. No representation of nutrient pulses that drive larval survival
4. Recruitment is continuous rather than pulsed

=== PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: NUTRIENT-ENHANCED RECRUITMENT ===

Note: This improvement requires nutrient_dat (chlorophyll-a, river discharge, or nutrient proxy) to be added to the dataset before implementation.

Rationale:
Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef are strongly linked to flood events that deliver nutrient-rich terrestrial runoff. These nutrients enhance phytoplankton productivity, which dramatically increases larval COTS survival during their planktonic phase. This creates episodic recruitment pulses that trigger the "boom" phase of boom-bust cycles.

Key ecological mechanisms:
1. Nutrient pulses (from floods) enhance phytoplankton food availability
2. Increased larval food leads to higher survival through the 2-4 week planktonic stage
3. Effect shows threshold behavior - low nutrients have minimal effect, high nutrients cause recruitment spikes
4. This creates the episodic nature of outbreaks rather than gradual population growth

Mathematical Implementation (when data available):
- Add nutrient_dat as a DATA_VECTOR (proxy for chlorophyll-a, river discharge, or nutrient concentration)
- Add log_nutrient_threshold: half-saturation constant for nutrient effect (Michaelis-Menten kinetics)
- Add log_nutrient_max_effect: maximum fold-increase in recruitment at high nutrients
- Modify recruitment equation to include: nutrient_enhancement = 1 + (nutrient_max_effect - 1) * (nutrient / (nutrient + nutrient_threshold))

This saturating response captures:
- Threshold behavior: minimal effect at low nutrients
- Saturation: diminishing returns at very high nutrients
- Realistic magnitude: 2-10x recruitment enhancement during flood events (literature-supported)

Expected Improvements:
1. Better capture timing of outbreak initiation (linked to flood years)
2. More realistic magnitude of population explosions
3. Episodic rather than continuous recruitment patterns
4. Improved prediction of boom-bust cycle characteristics

Parameter Justification:
- nutrient_threshold: Set to capture half-maximal effect at moderate nutrient levels (literature: ~0.5-2.0 Î¼g/L chlorophyll-a)
- nutrient_max_effect: Literature suggests 3-10x enhancement in larval survival during major flood events
- Both parameters will be estimated from data to optimize outbreak timing and magnitude

=== CURRENT MODEL STATUS ===

The model currently operates without nutrient enhancement. Once nutrient data becomes available, the parameters log_nutrient_threshold and log_nutrient_max_effect can be activated to implement this ecological improvement.
