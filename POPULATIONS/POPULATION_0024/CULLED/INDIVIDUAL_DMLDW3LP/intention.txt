MODEL ASSESSMENT (Current State):

The model captures core COTS-coral dynamics including:
- Allee effects at low COTS density
- Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response centered at ~28°C)
- Type II functional responses for coral predation with prey switching
- Density-dependent mortality
- Immigration effects
- Coral growth with temperature stress (threshold ~29°C)

IDENTIFIED GAP:

The model lacks a mechanistic trigger for episodic COTS outbreaks. Literature strongly supports that outbreaks are associated with nutrient pulses (terrestrial runoff, upwelling events) that enhance phytoplankton availability during the critical larval feeding period (~2-3 weeks). The current model has:
1. Temperature effects on recruitment (present)
2. Immigration as an additive term (present)
3. NO nutrient/food quality mechanism for larval survival (MISSING)

This gap is critical for the PROJECT CONTEXT goal of "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" and understanding "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events."

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Nutrient-Mediated Larval Survival

Add a mechanistic pathway where nutrient availability (proxy: chlorophyll-a concentration or river discharge) enhances larval survival through a saturating functional response. This interacts multiplicatively with temperature effects to create synergistic recruitment enhancement.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- COTS larvae are obligate planktotrophs requiring ~14-21 days of feeding before competency
- Phytoplankton (food for larvae) responds rapidly to nutrient pulses
- Field studies show COTS recruitment spikes follow flood events by 2-3 years (larval survival → juvenile growth → adult outbreak)
- The combination of warm temperatures (28-29°C) AND high nutrients creates optimal conditions for mass recruitment
- This provides the "trigger" mechanism for episodic outbreaks rather than continuous low-level recruitment

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Add DATA_VECTOR: nutrient_dat (chlorophyll-a mg/m³ or discharge proxy)
- Add PARAMETER: log_nutrient_half_sat (Michaelis-Menten half-saturation for larval survival)
- Add PARAMETER: nutrient_effect_max (maximum enhancement factor from nutrients, >1)
- Modify recruitment equation to include: nutrient_effect = 1 + (nutrient_effect_max - 1) * (nutrient / (nutrient + K_nutrient))
- This saturates at high nutrients (realistic) and creates synergy with temperature

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Model can now capture outbreak initiation from environmental triggers
- Boom-bust cycles emerge from interaction of: nutrient pulse → mass recruitment → population explosion → coral depletion → starvation → bust
- Better alignment with observed outbreak timing relative to environmental events
- Maintains all existing mechanisms while adding critical missing process

PARAMETER UPDATES:
- Added nutrient_dat as DATA_VECTOR (requires data input)
- Added log_nutrient_half_sat: initial value log(0.5) = -0.693 for chlorophyll-a (mg/m³), range log(0.1) to log(2.0)
- Added nutrient_effect_max: initial value 3.0 (nutrients can triple recruitment), range 1.0 to 10.0
- These values are ecologically plausible based on observed larval survival differences between low/high food conditions
