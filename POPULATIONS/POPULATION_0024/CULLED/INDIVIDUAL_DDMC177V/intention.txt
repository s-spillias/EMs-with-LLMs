MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements sophisticated COTS outbreak dynamics with:
1. Allee effects at low densities (Equation 1)
2. Temperature-dependent recruitment (Equation 2) 
3. Threshold-based outbreak amplification via Hill function (Equation 5)
4. Resource-dependent recruitment facilitation (Equation 6)
5. Type II functional responses for coral predation (Equations 8-9)

STRENGTHS:
- Captures threshold dynamics of outbreak initiation
- Includes multiple feedback mechanisms (Allee, resources, immigration)
- Distinguishes fast vs slow coral with differential predation
- Temperature effects on both COTS and corals

WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED:
1. Temperature response is symmetric Gaussian (Equation 2), but COTS biology shows asymmetric response
2. Doesn't capture that warm water EXTENDS larval survival rather than creating narrow optimum
3. Literature emphasizes COTS outbreaks during warm water events, not at specific optimal temperature
4. Current formulation may under-predict outbreak probability during warming periods

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: ASYMMETRIC TEMPERATURE RESPONSE ===

BIOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
Crown-of-Thorns starfish larvae are highly temperature-dependent:
- COLD WATER (<26°C): Severely limits larval development and survival (exponential decline)
- OPTIMAL RANGE (27-29°C): Maximum recruitment success
- WARM WATER (29-31°C): MAINTAINS or INCREASES recruitment (extended larval period, more food)
- EXTREME HEAT (>31°C): Only then does recruitment decline (metabolic stress)

This asymmetric response is critical for modeling outbreaks because:
1. Warm water anomalies TRIGGER outbreaks by extending larval survival windows
2. Climate warming increases outbreak frequency by expanding suitable temperature ranges
3. The symmetric Gaussian underestimates recruitment during warming events

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Replace Equation 2 (Gaussian) with asymmetric logistic-exponential function:

For T < T_opt:
  temp_effect = exp(temp_sensitivity_cold * (T - T_opt))
  
For T >= T_opt:
  temp_effect = 1 / (1 + exp(temp_sensitivity_warm * (T - T_max)))

Where:
- temp_sensitivity_cold: controls steepness of cold-side decline (sharp drop below optimum)
- temp_sensitivity_warm: controls steepness of warm-side decline (gradual, only at extremes)
- T_max: extreme temperature where recruitment begins declining

This creates:
- Exponential decline below optimal (cold-sensitive larvae)
- Plateau at optimal temperature (maximum recruitment)
- Maintained recruitment above optimal (warm water benefits)
- Gradual decline only at extreme temperatures (>31°C)

PARAMETERS ADDED:
1. temp_sensitivity_cold: Steepness of recruitment decline in cold water (°C^-1)
   - Higher values = sharper cold sensitivity
   - Estimated: 0.5-1.0 based on larval development rates
   
2. temp_sensitivity_warm: Steepness of recruitment decline in extreme heat (°C^-1)
   - Lower values = gradual decline (recruitment maintained in warm water)
   - Estimated: 0.2-0.4 based on thermal tolerance limits
   
3. log_temp_max: Log of extreme temperature threshold where recruitment declines (°C)
   - Represents bleaching-level temperatures (>31°C)
   - Estimated: log(31) = 3.434

PARAMETERS REMOVED:
- log_temp_width: No longer needed with asymmetric formulation

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
1. Better capture of outbreak timing during warm water events
2. Increased outbreak probability during climate warming scenarios
3. More realistic representation of temperature-recruitment relationship
4. Improved fit to observed outbreak patterns on GBR

This modification maintains model complexity while improving ecological realism for the key driver of COTS outbreaks: warm water conditions that extend larval survival and development periods.
