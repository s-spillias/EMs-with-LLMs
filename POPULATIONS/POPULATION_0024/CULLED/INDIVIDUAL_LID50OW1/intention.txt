MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model includes sophisticated outbreak dynamics with threshold-based recruitment (Hill function), 
immigration weighting, and resource-recruitment coupling. However, analysis reveals several areas for improvement:

1. PARAMETER VALUE UPDATES:
   - log_temp_opt has been updated from literature to 3.3495 (≈28.4°C)
   - This suggests the temperature response needs refinement to match empirical data

2. KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP:
   - The model conflates larval settlement with juvenile recruitment to adult population
   - COTS outbreaks are often triggered by exceptional JUVENILE SURVIVAL during favorable conditions
   - Current single-stage recruitment doesn't capture the critical bottleneck at juvenile stage

3. TEMPERATURE RESPONSE OVERSIMPLIFICATION:
   - Current symmetric Gaussian (Equation 2) doesn't match COTS thermal biology
   - COTS show asymmetric thermal tolerance (tolerate cool better than warm)
   - Recruitment success is skewed, not symmetric around optimum

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: TWO-STAGE RECRUITMENT WITH ASYMMETRIC THERMAL RESPONSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
COTS population explosions result from two sequential processes:
1. LARVAL SETTLEMENT: Larvae must arrive and settle (influenced by temperature, larval supply)
2. JUVENILE SURVIVAL: Settled juveniles must survive to reproductive adults (influenced by food, 
   predation, environmental conditions)

The critical outbreak trigger is often EXCEPTIONAL JUVENILE SURVIVAL during favorable years 
(high phytoplankton from nutrient pulses, abundant coral food, optimal temperatures). This creates
the characteristic episodic nature of outbreaks - most years have normal low survival, but 
occasional years have very high survival leading to population explosions.

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
----------------------------

1. REPLACE SYMMETRIC GAUSSIAN TEMPERATURE RESPONSE (old Equation 2):
   Old: temp_effect = exp(-0.5 * (temp_diff / temp_width)^2)
   
   New: SKEWED TEMPERATURE RESPONSE using log-normal-like function:
   - Below optimum: gradual decline (COTS tolerate cooler water reasonably well)
   - Above optimum: steeper decline (COTS sensitive to warm water stress)
   
   temp_effect_settlement = exp(-0.5 * ((sst - temp_opt) / temp_width_lower)^2)  if sst < temp_opt
   temp_effect_settlement = exp(-0.5 * ((sst - temp_opt) / temp_width_upper)^2)  if sst >= temp_opt
   
   where temp_width_upper < temp_width_lower (steeper decline above optimum)

2. ADD JUVENILE SURVIVAL STAGE:
   - Larval settlement produces juveniles (not directly added to adult population)
   - Juvenile survival to adulthood depends on:
     a) Food availability (coral cover) - well-fed juveniles survive better
     b) Temperature conditions - juveniles sensitive to thermal stress
     c) Density-dependent effects - crowding reduces survival
   
   juvenile_survival_efficiency = base_survival * food_effect * temp_effect_juvenile * density_effect
   
   where:
   - food_effect increases with coral availability (saturating function)
   - temp_effect_juvenile uses same asymmetric response as settlement
   - density_effect decreases with juvenile crowding (competition)

3. MODIFIED RECRUITMENT FLOW:
   Old flow: larval_supply → recruitment_amplification → direct addition to adults
   
   New flow: larval_supply → settlement (temp-dependent) → juveniles → 
             survival (food & temp dependent) → recruitment to adults
   
   This creates a two-stage filter where outbreaks require BOTH:
   - High larval supply (immigration + local reproduction)
   - High juvenile survival (favorable environmental conditions)

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
--------------------
1. log_temp_width_lower: Temperature tolerance below optimum (wider, more tolerant)
   - Initial value: 1.099 (≈3°C, untransformed)
   - Bounds: [0.5, 2.0] (1.6-7.4°C range)
   - Justification: COTS can recruit across ~3-4°C below optimum

2. log_temp_width_upper: Temperature tolerance above optimum (narrower, less tolerant)
   - Initial value: 0.405 (≈1.5°C, untransformed)
   - Bounds: [0.0, 1.5] (1.0-4.5°C range)
   - Justification: COTS recruitment drops sharply >1-2°C above optimum

3. log_juvenile_survival_base: Baseline juvenile survival rate (proportion surviving to adult)
   - Initial value: -2.303 (≈0.1, untransformed - 10% baseline survival)
   - Bounds: [-4.0, -1.0] (1.8%-36.8% survival range)
   - Justification: Most juveniles die; only ~5-15% survive to adulthood normally

4. juvenile_food_sensitivity: Sensitivity of juvenile survival to coral food availability
   - Initial value: 0.8 (dimensionless, 0-1 scale)
   - Bounds: [0.0, 1.0]
   - Justification: Juveniles highly dependent on coral food; high sensitivity captures this

5. log_juvenile_food_halfsat: Half-saturation constant for food effect on juvenile survival
   - Initial value: 3.219 (≈25% coral cover, untransformed)
   - Bounds: [2.5, 4.0] (12-55% coral cover)
   - Justification: Juvenile survival saturates at moderate-high coral cover (~20-30%)

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
---------------------
1. Better capture episodic outbreak dynamics - outbreaks require alignment of:
   - High larval supply (immigration events)
   - Favorable temperatures (near optimum)
   - High coral food availability (for juvenile survival)

2. More realistic temperature response matching COTS thermal biology

3. Explicit representation of the juvenile survival bottleneck that triggers outbreaks

4. Better prediction of outbreak timing - requires multiple favorable conditions to align

5. Improved model fit by separating settlement from recruitment processes

EQUATIONS MODIFIED:
------------------
- Equation 2: Replaced with asymmetric temperature response for settlement
- New equations added for:
  - Juvenile survival efficiency calculation
  - Food-dependent survival effect
  - Temperature effect on juvenile survival
  - Two-stage recruitment process (settlement → survival → recruitment)

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding critical ecological realism for 
capturing the episodic nature of COTS outbreaks emphasized in the PROJECT CONTEXT.
