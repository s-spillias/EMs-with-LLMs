MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Comprehensive predator-prey dynamics between COTS and two coral functional groups
- Allee effects to capture low-density recruitment limitation
- Temperature modulation of COTS recruitment
- Type II functional responses with prey switching
- Density-dependent mortality

Potential Weaknesses for Capturing Outbreak Dynamics:
1. The current model treats favorable conditions (temperature, immigration, food) as independent multiplicative factors
2. Real COTS outbreaks show explosive, super-exponential growth when multiple conditions align simultaneously
3. Updated parameter values from literature reveal:
   - Optimal temperature (28.4°C) is very close to coral stress threshold (29°C)
   - Temperature tolerance window is narrow (~2°C)
   - This suggests a critical narrow window where COTS thrive while corals are stressed

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT ===

Addition: Synergistic Outbreak Trigger Mechanism

Ecological Justification:
COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef are characterized by explosive population growth when multiple favorable conditions coincide - a "perfect storm" scenario. The current model's independent multiplicative effects don't capture the non-linear synergy observed in nature.

The improvement adds a threshold-based outbreak amplification factor that activates when:
1. Temperature is near optimal (within the narrow window identified by literature)
2. Larval immigration is elevated (connectivity from upstream reefs)
3. Coral food resources are abundant (sufficient prey to sustain rapid growth)

When all three conditions are simultaneously favorable, COTS experience super-exponential growth beyond what independent factors would predict. This captures the characteristic "boom" phase of boom-bust cycles.

Mathematical Implementation:
- New parameter: outbreak_threshold (0-1 scale) - threshold for triggering outbreak amplification
- New parameter: outbreak_strength - magnitude of amplification when threshold exceeded
- Composite favorability index combining standardized temperature, immigration, and food availability
- Sigmoidal activation function that sharply increases growth when favorability exceeds threshold

This mechanism:
- Explains rapid onset of outbreaks (sharp threshold response)
- Maintains existing boom-bust dynamics (density dependence still operates)
- Respects updated parameter constraints (narrow temperature window)
- Adds minimal complexity (2 parameters) for substantial ecological realism

The outbreak amplification only affects the growth term, while mortality and other regulatory mechanisms remain unchanged, ensuring outbreaks eventually collapse as in nature.
