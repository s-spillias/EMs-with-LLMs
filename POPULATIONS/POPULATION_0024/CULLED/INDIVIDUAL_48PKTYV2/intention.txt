MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model includes sophisticated mechanisms for COTS outbreak dynamics:
- Allee effects with Hill function for threshold behavior
- Temperature-dependent recruitment with asymmetry
- Synergistic recruitment amplification
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Density-dependent mortality

However, analysis reveals a critical missing process for capturing episodic outbreak dynamics.

=== KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED ===

The current model lacks a density-dependent FERTILIZATION SUCCESS function that is central to COTS reproductive biology and outbreak dynamics. 

Empirical evidence shows COTS fertilization success follows a hump-shaped curve:
1. LOW DENSITY (<0.1 ind/m²): Poor fertilization due to mate-finding limitation (Allee effect)
2. INTERMEDIATE DENSITY (0.2-2 ind/m²): OPTIMAL fertilization due to:
   - Aggregation behavior bringing adults together
   - Synchronized spawning events
   - Optimal sperm:egg ratios
   - This is the "outbreak initiation zone"
3. HIGH DENSITY (>5 ind/m²): DECLINING fertilization due to:
   - Sperm dilution effects
   - Gamete wastage and polyspermy
   - Resource depletion affecting gamete quality
   - This provides a natural outbreak collapse mechanism

The current model has the Allee effect (zone 1) but lacks zones 2-3, which are essential for:
- Explaining why outbreaks explosively initiate at intermediate densities
- Providing an intrinsic density-dependent brake on runaway growth
- Creating the characteristic boom-bust cycles observed in field data

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add a FERTILIZATION EFFICIENCY FUNCTION that modulates recruitment across all density ranges:

Mathematical form: Ricker-like hump function
  fertilization_efficiency = (cots_density / optimal_density) * exp(1 - cots_density / optimal_density)

This function:
- Increases from zero at zero density (Allee effect maintained)
- Peaks at optimal_density (outbreak initiation zone)
- Declines at high density (intrinsic outbreak brake)
- Is well-established in fisheries and population ecology
- Has clear biological interpretation for broadcast spawners

=== NEW PARAMETERS ADDED ===

1. log_fertilization_optimal_density: Log of density where fertilization is maximized
   - Ecological meaning: The "sweet spot" density for outbreak initiation
   - Expected range: 0.5-2.0 ind/m² (log scale: -0.693 to 0.693)
   - Literature support: COTS aggregations during spawning events

2. fertilization_efficiency_max: Maximum fertilization efficiency multiplier
   - Ecological meaning: How much recruitment is amplified at optimal density
   - Expected range: 1.5-4.0 (must be >1 to create hump)
   - Represents synchronized spawning advantage

=== IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ===

The fertilization efficiency function is inserted into the COTS growth equation (Equation 13) as a multiplier on the recruitment terms. This:
- Preserves all existing mechanisms (Allee, temperature, synergy)
- Adds the missing density-dependent fertilization biology
- Creates more realistic outbreak initiation and collapse dynamics
- Provides a mechanistic explanation for episodic rather than sustained outbreaks

The modification maintains the model's existing structure while adding a critical biological realism that should improve fit to the characteristic boom-bust outbreak patterns observed in COTS populations on the Great Barrier Reef.

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

1. Better capture of outbreak INITIATION timing (when density reaches optimal zone)
2. More realistic outbreak MAGNITUDE (amplified recruitment at intermediate density)
3. Improved outbreak COLLAPSE dynamics (intrinsic brake at high density)
4. More accurate boom-bust CYCLING (hump function creates oscillatory dynamics)
5. Better distinction between endemic and outbreak phases
