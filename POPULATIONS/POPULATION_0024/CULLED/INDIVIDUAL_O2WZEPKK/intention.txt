MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Threshold-based recruitment dynamics (Hill function) can generate episodic outbreaks
2. Comprehensive predation model with prey switching between coral types
3. Temperature effects on both COTS and coral populations
4. Immigration-driven outbreak initiation mechanism

Weaknesses Identified:
1. No density-dependent interference in predation efficiency during high-density outbreaks
2. Attack rates remain constant regardless of COTS crowding
3. Missing behavioral mechanism for outbreak self-limitation
4. Outbreak collapse relies solely on resource depletion, not interference competition

=== ECOLOGICAL RATIONALE FOR IMPROVEMENT ===

Crown-of-Thorns starfish exhibit strong interference competition during outbreak conditions:
- At high densities (>1-2 individuals/m²), COTS physically interfere with each other's feeding
- Aggregation during outbreaks reduces per-capita feeding efficiency
- This creates a density-dependent negative feedback independent of prey availability
- Interference contributes to rapid outbreak collapse even when coral remains available

Current model limitation:
- Attack rates (attack_fast, attack_slow) are constants
- No mechanism for reduced feeding efficiency at high COTS densities
- Outbreaks can only collapse through coral depletion or mortality
- Missing key self-limiting mechanism observed in field studies

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add density-dependent predation interference:

1. New parameter: interference_strength
   - Quantifies reduction in attack rate per unit COTS density
   - Dimensionless scaling factor (m²/individuals)
   - Expected range: 0.1-0.5 based on behavioral studies
   - Higher values = stronger interference effect

2. Modified attack rates:
   - Effective attack rate = base attack rate / (1 + interference_strength × COTS_density)
   - Rational function ensures smooth decline with density
   - At low density: minimal interference, attack rate ≈ base rate
   - At outbreak density (5 ind/m²): attack rate reduced by 30-70%

3. Ecological benefits:
   - Creates self-limiting outbreak dynamics
   - Captures rapid collapse phase of boom-bust cycles
   - Reduces dependence on complete coral depletion for outbreak termination
   - More realistic representation of high-density COTS behavior

=== MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION ===

Original (Equations 8-9):
consumption_fast = (attack_fast × fast_prev × cots_prev) / (1 + attack_fast × handling_fast × fast_prev)

Modified:
effective_attack_fast = attack_fast / (1 + interference_strength × cots_prev)
consumption_fast = (effective_attack_fast × fast_prev × cots_prev) / (1 + effective_attack_fast × handling_fast × fast_prev)

Same modification applied to slow coral predation.

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

1. More realistic outbreak dynamics:
   - Rapid rise phase when COTS density is low (minimal interference)
   - Peak density limited by interference, not just carrying capacity
   - Faster collapse as interference intensifies at high density

2. Better fit to boom-bust cycles:
   - Sharper peaks with faster decline
   - Outbreaks terminate before complete coral depletion
   - More realistic recovery dynamics

3. Improved ecological realism:
   - Captures observed behavioral mechanisms
   - Reduces reliance on starvation as sole limiting factor
   - Represents intraspecific competition during outbreaks

=== PARAMETER JUSTIFICATION ===

interference_strength:
- Units: m²/individuals (inverse density scaling)
- Ecological meaning: strength of feeding interference per COTS individual
- Literature basis: Field observations show 30-70% reduction in feeding rates at outbreak densities
- Initial value: 0.3 (moderate interference)
- Range: 0.1-0.5 (weak to strong interference)
- Priority: 2 (important for outbreak dynamics, but not as critical as base attack rates)
