MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model includes comprehensive mechanisms for COTS-coral dynamics:
- Allee effects at low density
- Temperature-dependent recruitment  
- Type II functional responses for coral predation
- Prey preference and switching behavior
- Immigration enhancement
- Density-dependent mortality
- Temperature stress on corals
- Nutrient-mediated recruitment (inactive, awaiting data)

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The model treats all COTS individuals as having equal predation capacity, but ecological reality shows:
1. Juvenile COTS (< 1 year) have minimal coral consumption rates
2. Adult COTS (> 1 year) consume coral at 10-20x higher rates
3. At low densities, populations are recruitment-limited with high juvenile:adult ratios
4. At outbreak densities, populations are adult-dominated with high per-capita consumption
5. This creates a critical positive feedback: more adults → more coral consumed → more COTS biomass → faster maturation → more adults

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add density-dependent predation efficiency to capture size/age structure effects without full age-structured modeling.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- At low COTS densities (< 0.5 ind/m²): Population is recruitment-limited, high proportion of juveniles, low per-capita predation efficiency (~0.3-0.5 of maximum)
- At intermediate densities (0.5-2 ind/m²): Transition zone as cohorts mature, increasing efficiency
- At outbreak densities (> 2 ind/m²): Adult-dominated population, maximum per-capita predation efficiency (1.0)

This mechanism is critical for episodic outbreak dynamics because:
1. It creates a threshold effect - outbreaks accelerate once density crosses into adult-dominated regime
2. It explains why low-level COTS presence doesn't always lead to outbreaks
3. It captures the rapid acceleration phase of outbreaks observed in field data
4. It provides a mechanistic basis for boom-bust cycles

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Use a sigmoidal function (logistic curve) to model predation efficiency as a function of COTS density:

predation_efficiency = efficiency_min + (1.0 - efficiency_min) / (1.0 + exp(-efficiency_steepness * (cots_density - efficiency_threshold)))

Where:
- efficiency_min: Minimum efficiency at very low density (juvenile-dominated, ~0.3)
- efficiency_threshold: Density at which efficiency is halfway to maximum (~1.0 ind/m²)
- efficiency_steepness: Rate of transition from juvenile to adult-dominated (controls threshold sharpness, ~2.0)

This multiplies the attack rates in the functional response equations, making per-capita predation increase with population density in a biologically realistic way.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
1. Better capture of outbreak initiation thresholds
2. More realistic acceleration of coral loss during outbreak phase
3. Improved representation of boom-bust cycle dynamics
4. Maintains model parsimony (3 new parameters vs. full age structure)

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- efficiency_min: Minimum predation efficiency (0.2-0.5, default 0.3)
- log_efficiency_threshold: Log density for half-maximal efficiency (log(0.5)-log(2.0), default log(1.0)=0.0)
- efficiency_steepness: Steepness of efficiency transition (1.0-4.0, default 2.0)
