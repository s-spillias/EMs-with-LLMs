MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL:
The current model attempts to capture COTS-coral dynamics but has several limitations for representing episodic outbreaks:

1. RECRUITMENT MECHANISM OVERSIMPLIFIED:
   - Current Equation 3 uses smooth logistic growth with Allee effect
   - Real COTS outbreaks are triggered by episodic larval settlement events
   - Immigration (cotsimm_dat) is added linearly without settlement success modulation
   - Missing the pulsed recruitment pattern that creates boom-bust cycles

2. PARAMETER EVIDENCE SUGGESTS STRUCTURAL ISSUE:
   - log_mort_cots updated from literature: 0.939 (mortality ~2.56/year)
   - Very tight bounds indicate high confidence in this high mortality rate
   - High mortality + smooth recruitment = gradual equilibrium, NOT boom-bust
   - Need pulsed recruitment to overcome high mortality and create outbreaks

3. MISSING ECOLOGICAL REALISM:
   - No distinction between local recruitment and larval settlement
   - Settlement success should depend on substrate availability
   - Larval settlement should have conspecific attraction (gregarious settlement)
   - Current Allee effect (Eq 1) only affects reproduction, not settlement

CHOSEN IMPROVEMENT: LARVAL SETTLEMENT SUCCESS FUNCTION

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
COTS outbreaks on the GBR are driven by episodic larval settlement events, not gradual population growth. Key ecological processes:

1. SUBSTRATE LIMITATION:
   - Larvae need hard substrate to settle
   - Coral cover provides settlement surface
   - High COTS density reduces available space
   - Settlement success should saturate as space fills

2. GREGARIOUS SETTLEMENT:
   - COTS larvae are attracted to conspecifics (chemical cues)
   - Creates positive feedback at low-moderate densities
   - Amplifies settlement pulses into outbreaks
   - Different from reproductive Allee effect (already in model)

3. ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERING:
   - Temperature affects larval survival and settlement
   - Already have temp_opt parameter for optimal temperature
   - Settlement success should peak near optimal temperature

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

NEW EQUATION: Larval Settlement Success
settlement_success = substrate_availability × gregarious_factor × temp_suitability

Where:
- substrate_availability = (K_coral - (fast + slow)) / K_coral × (1 - cots/K_cots)
  Decreases as coral is lost and COTS density increases
  
- gregarious_factor = 1 + gregarious_strength × (cots / (cots + gregarious_threshold))
  Michaelis-Menten function: increases with COTS density then saturates
  Creates positive feedback for settlement at low-moderate densities
  
- temp_suitability = exp(-temp_effect_settlement × (sst - temp_opt)²)
  Gaussian centered on optimal temperature

MODIFIED RECRUITMENT STRUCTURE:
- Local recruitment: existing Equation 3 (from resident population)
- Larval settlement: immigration × settlement_success (from external sources)
- Total recruitment = local + settlement

This separates the two biological processes and allows immigration pulses to trigger outbreaks when settlement conditions are favorable, but fail when conditions are poor.

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
1. gregarious_strength (dimensionless, 0-5):
   - Strength of conspecific attraction for settlement
   - Literature suggests 2-3x increase in settlement near conspecifics
   - Initial value: 2.0, bounds: [0.0, 5.0]

2. log_gregarious_threshold (log individuals/m²):
   - COTS density at which gregarious effect is half-maximal
   - Should be lower than Allee threshold (settlement vs reproduction)
   - Initial value: -3.0 (exp(-3.0) ≈ 0.05 individuals/m²)
   - Bounds: [-5.0, -1.0]

3. temp_effect_settlement (°C⁻²):
   - Temperature sensitivity for larval settlement
   - Larvae more sensitive than adults
   - Initial value: 0.15 (slightly higher than temp_effect_cots = 0.1)
   - Bounds: [0.0, 0.5]

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
1. Immigration pulses can trigger outbreaks when:
   - Sufficient coral substrate available
   - Temperature near optimal
   - Some conspecifics present for attraction
   
2. Immigration pulses fail when:
   - Coral depleted (no settlement substrate)
   - Temperature suboptimal
   - COTS density already at capacity

3. Creates episodic boom-bust pattern:
   - Boom: successful settlement → rapid increase → coral predation
   - Bust: coral depletion → reduced settlement success → high mortality dominates

4. Maintains biological realism:
   - Separates local vs external recruitment sources
   - Captures substrate limitation
   - Includes gregarious settlement behavior
   - Temperature modulation of settlement

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT requirement for "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" by implementing the ecological mechanism that triggers episodic outbreaks.
