CROWN-OF-THORNS STARFISH OUTBREAK MODEL

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, capturing the characteristic boom-bust cycles observed in field data.

KEY ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects at low densities (aggregation benefits for reproduction)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival and development rates
   - Immigration of larvae from external sources (connectivity between reefs)
   - Natural mortality increasing with density (disease, predation at high densities)
   - Starvation mortality when coral resources are depleted

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Two functional groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites)
   - Logistic growth with different intrinsic rates reflecting life history strategies
   - Selective predation by COTS with Type II functional response
   - Preference for fast-growing corals but switching to slow-growing when preferred prey depleted
   - Temperature stress effects on coral growth and recovery

3. Outbreak Mechanisms:
   - Larval immigration pulses trigger initial population increases
   - Abundant coral resources sustain exponential growth phase
   - Positive feedback through aggregation-enhanced reproduction
   - Outbreak collapse driven by coral depletion and density-dependent mortality
   - Recovery phase limited by low coral cover and Allee effects

4. Environmental Forcing:
   - Sea surface temperature affects both COTS larval survival and coral stress
   - Warm temperatures enhance COTS recruitment but can stress corals
   - Larval immigration represents connectivity and upstream outbreak events

The model predicts COTS abundance and coral cover for both functional groups, capturing the observed patterns of rapid population explosions, sustained high densities during coral-rich periods, and population crashes following resource depletion.
