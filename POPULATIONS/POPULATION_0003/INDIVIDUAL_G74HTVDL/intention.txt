Assessment and context alignment
- Data fit: A residuals file was referenced but not provided here. Without residuals, the assessment below focuses on structural identifiability and ecological plausibility. Please share the residuals to refine diagnostics (e.g., whether peaks are underpredicted and troughs overpredicted).
- Current structure: The model includes (a) space-limited logistic coral growth with temperature modifiers and selective predation, (b) COTS recruitment with an Allee/Hill fertilization term and SST-driven larval performance, (c) immigration via a saturating function, and (d) Beverton–Holt crowding on adults. This structure can generate non-linear dynamics and boom–bust behavior if recruitment pulses are strong relative to mortality and crowding.
- Project context fit: Core mechanisms relevant to boom–busts are present (Allee effect, predation feedback on coral, temperature effects, crowding). However, a key outbreak trigger recognized in the GBR literature—episodic pulses in larval survival driven by flood/nutrient/primary productivity conditions—is missing. Outbreaks are often linked to years with enhanced larval survival rather than only sustained high immigration or constant fecundity.

Key ecological processes potentially missing or oversimplified
- Episodic larval survival pulses: Recruitment currently varies with adult density (Allee) and SST, but lacks a driver for episodic, year-specific boosts tied to environmental conditions (e.g., nutrient and phytoplankton pulses following floods). This limits the model’s ability to reproduce sharp outbreak onsets aligned with those events.
- Stage structure: No explicit juvenile stage or delay beyond the annual step. While acceptable for parsimony, it can smooth out outbreak onset/decay.
- Predation on juveniles/cannibalism: Not represented; including this would require a juvenile pool and additional data.
- Environmental modifiers of adult mortality: Only food limitation is included; temperature or extreme conditions might also modulate adult survival, but this is secondary to larval survival for triggering outbreaks.

Parameter review
- Most parameters are initial estimates with biological ranges enforced via smooth penalties. Literature-informed values for Topt and sigmaT terms appear reasonable as starting points.
- The functional response exponent q (q=1.5 initially) allows for Type III predation, which can delay predation at low coral cover and create non-linear dynamics—a good choice for outbreak contexts.
- No clear evidence provided here that any parameter values were updated from literature in ways that invalidate current functional forms; thus, a targeted addition is preferable to wholesale changes.

Chosen improvement: Environmental recruitment pulse amplifier
- Rationale: To capture episodic outbreak triggers, we introduce a multiplicative recruitment amplifier linked to an environmental proxy. In the absence of a dedicated nutrient/flood covariate, we use cotsimm_dat as a pragmatic proxy for the combined effect of larval supply/connectivity and broad-scale conditions that can coincide with nutrient pulses. This retains parsimony while enabling sharp recruitment surges when the proxy is high.
- Mathematical form: Multiply recruits by M(t) = 1 + psi_nutr * imm / (k_imm + imm), where imm = cotsimm_dat(t). This is a bounded ≥1 multiplier with a saturating response that produces marked pulses when imm is large but avoids unbounded growth. It shares k_imm with immigration to limit overparameterization and identifiability issues.
- Implementation:
  recruits(t) = fec * C_t * phi_spawn(t) * phi_T_COTS(t) * M(t)
  with M(t) as above and psi_nutr ≥ 0 estimated from data (penalized within a plausible range).
- Expected effect on fit: If residuals show underprediction at observed peaks and/or mis-timed outbreak onsets, the amplifier allows the model to match both timing and magnitude without inflating baseline fecundity and thereby overpredicting non-peak years.

Notes on identifiability and data leakage
- Identifiability: Using the same half-saturation k_imm for both immigration and the amplifier reduces parameter proliferation and helps identifiability. The amplitude psi_nutr captures how strongly environmental pulses translate into local recruitment boosts versus external immigration alone.
- Data leakage: Only exogenous covariates at time t (sst_dat, cotsimm_dat) are used to determine state updates at t+1. Observations of response variables (cots_dat, fast_dat, slow_dat) are not used in the process equations beyond t=0 initial states.

What to check next
- Please provide residuals to verify whether peak underprediction improves and troughs remain well captured.
- If a dedicated flood/nutrient proxy becomes available, consider replacing cotsimm_dat in the amplifier with that covariate, or adding a separate half-saturation parameter for the nutrient effect if data support it.
