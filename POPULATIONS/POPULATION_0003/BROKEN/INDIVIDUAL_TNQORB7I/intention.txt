Assessment:
- The current model reasonably fits the data and captures boom-bust cycles, though the residuals indicate that the model underestimates the initiation of outbreaks.
- While the model successfully incorporates resource limitation via saturating functions and environmental modulation using sea surface temperature, it ignores larval immigration (cotsimm_dat), which is key to triggering outbreaks.
- To improve the model, we add larval immigration as an additive forcing term, scaled by a new parameter (weight_immigration). This reflects ecological observations that external recruitment events can spur outbreak initiation.
- This enhancement retains the integrity of using only previous time step values, thereby avoiding data leakage.
