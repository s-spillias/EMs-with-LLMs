Assessment:
The current model captures outbreak triggers via larval immigration and outbreak efficiency. However, it lacks an explicit density‐dependent feedback mechanism, which is crucial to realistically capture the boom–bust cycles of Crown-of-Thorns starfish. In nature, resource limitation and competition constrain rapid population explosions, eventually leading to declines. To address this, a logistic growth term is introduced into the COTS dynamics by incorporating a new parameter, cots_carrying_capacity, representing the resource limitation effect. This improvement ensures that as the population nears carrying capacity, the effective growth rate slows down, delivering more realistic dynamics.
