Assessment and rationale for improvement

1) Model fit to data
- Residuals: A residuals file was referenced, but it was not provided in this context. Without the file, a quantitative residual analysis cannot be performed here.
- Structural expectations: In similar COTS systems, immediate recruitment to adults (t->t+1) often produces dynamics that are too smooth and can mis-time outbreak peaks (phase lead), with adult peaks occurring too soon after spawning years. This usually shows up as systematic, multi-year residual patterns (positive before and negative after observed peaks).
- Observation models: Lognormal for COTS and logit-normal for coral proportions are appropriate and numerically stabilized, which should reduce leverage from zeros/extremes.

2) Alignment with project context (episodic outbreaks and selective predation)
- Strengths:
  - Temperature modifiers for COTS larvae and coral performance exist.
  - Food limitation feeds back on adult survival.
  - Selective predation with preference and flexible Type II/III exponent is implemented.
  - Immigration is included with saturation.
  - Adult self-limitation via Beverton–Holt is present.
- Gaps relevant to outbreak timing:
  - No explicit maturation delay from spawning to adulthood. COTS typically reproduce at about 2–3 years; collapsing all recruitment to t+1 can under-represent cohort-driven booms and the observed lag between environmental triggers and adult outbreaks.
  - External environmental pulses other than SST (e.g., flood plume/runoff nutrients affecting larval food) are not modeled due to lack of inputs here.

3) Potentially missing or simplified processes
- Most critical for boom-bust timing: maturation delay (2–3 years) from spawning to adult stage.
- Other candidates (not added now to avoid over-parameterization without data):
  - Runoff-driven larval survival pulses, bleaching-induced coral mortality pulses, explicit stage structure with subadult survival, predator control or fishing of predators, and asymmetric thermal damage to corals at high temperatures.

Chosen ecological improvement: maturation delay via scheduled recruitment split
- Approach: Introduce a single parameter that allocates a fraction of recruits to mature after an extra year (t+2) while the remainder mature at t+1. Implemented using a recruitment schedule buffer; no new state observed variables and no use of current-year observations.
- Justification:
  - Captures the empirically supported 2–3 year delay to reproductive/adult stages.
  - Provides the necessary phase lag for boom years and helps generate sharper, episodic peaks (cohort accumulation) followed by busts (exhausted cohorts plus predation and density dependence).
  - Adds minimal complexity (one parameter) and is identifiable against multi-year time series.
- Mathematical changes:
  - Total recruits R_tot(t) = fec * C_t * phi_spawn(t) * phi_T_COTS(t)
  - Split by frac_delay in (0,1): R_immed(t) = (1 - frac_delay) * R_tot(t) and R_delay(t) = frac_delay * R_tot(t)
  - Adults at t+1 receive C_surv(t) + I(t) + R_immed(t) + delayed_in(t), where delayed_in(t) are recruits previously scheduled to arrive now (from t-1’s delay).
  - Schedule new delayed recruits to arrive at t+2.
  - Apply existing Beverton–Holt crowding thereafter.
- Parameterization:
  - New parameter delay_logit, with frac_delay = inv_logit(delay_logit). Initial value 1.3863 implies frac_delay ≈ 0.8, reflecting literature that most recruits reach adulthood after ~2 years.
  - No hard bounds required on delay_logit; frac_delay is naturally in (0,1).
- Data usage and leakage:
  - Only Year, sst_dat, and cotsimm_dat are used as drivers; observational series (cots_dat, fast_dat, slow_dat) are used for t=0 initialization only, consistent with no leakage.
- Expected effects on fit:
  - Better alignment of outbreak timing (phase), improved peak magnitudes through cohort accumulation, and more realistic decay after peaks due to density dependence and predation.

Notes on current parameter values
- Literature-tagged parameters (e.g., mC, max_cons, Topt_cots, Topt_coral, sigmaT_*) are consistent with the current forms.
- No evidence presented here requires changing functional forms (e.g., switching from Gaussian thermal curves) at this time.
- If future residuals show temperature asymmetry (e.g., high-temp penalties stronger than low), consider replacing coral Gaussian with a skewed thermal response or a piecewise function; not applied now to keep complexity minimal.

Summary
- Implemented a single, ecologically grounded maturation delay that is central to episodic COTS outbreaks and does not introduce data leakage. This should enhance the model’s ability to reproduce boom-bust cycles in timing and magnitude with minimal added complexity.
