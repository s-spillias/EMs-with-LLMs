ASSESSMENT

Data fit (based on model structure; residuals file not provided):
- Without the residual series, I cannot quantify fit. However, given the previous functional response (predation pressure decreasing as coral cover increases), the model likely:
  - Under-predicts the magnitude and speed of outbreak peaks (COTS booms), because per-capita consumption increases too slowly with prey availability.
  - Over-predicts coral persistence during outbreaks, because depredation pressure is dampened when coral is abundant.
  - May show timing lags (peaks predicted later than observed) if consumption and recruit-fueling are too weak early in the outbreak.
- Expected residual patterns (to verify once residuals are available):
  - Positive residuals for COTS during outbreak onsets (observed > predicted).
  - Negative residuals for coral (especially fast coral) during outbreak peaks (observed < predicted), indicating under-estimated predation losses.

Project-context alignment:
- Strengths:
  - Selective predation on fast/slow coral is represented.
  - Temperature effects modify recruitment (thermal performance).
  - Bleaching impacts coral mortality.
  - Beverton–Holt density dependence stabilizes adult COTS.
  - Immigration forcing allows episodic external inputs.
- Gaps/oversimplifications relative to episodic outbreak dynamics:
  - Functional response previously saturated with prey cover in the denominator (h + F_t), making depredation pressure decline with increasing coral. This blunts boom-bust dynamics and is ecologically inconsistent for a handling/encounter-limited predator.
  - No explicit nutrient/primary productivity driver for larval food (often implicated in outbreaks). Not added here due to lack of a corresponding forcing time series.
  - No explicit prey refuge/Type III depensation at low coral cover, which can shape the collapse phase and recovery dynamics.
  - Recruitment efficiency is linear in consumed coral; this may be acceptable but could be revisited if residuals show convexity/concavity.

Parameter review:
- Current parameters are plausible and bounded with biologically reasonable ranges. No evidence provided that literature updates require a structural re-scaling.
- Key consistency note: hF and hS are in percent cover units. Any depredation term that uses hF/hS must keep those units consistent.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT

Rationale:
- To better capture rapid, high-magnitude outbreaks and subsequent collapses, strengthen the coupling between predator abundance and prey availability using a predator-saturating, prey-sigmoidal (Type III-like) functional response. This is a minimal structural change with strong ecological grounding (handling time and encounter rates) that preserves positivity and boundedness.

Mathematical change:
- Replace the depredation “pressure” terms with:
  qF = aF * C_t * F_t / (hF + F_t)
  qS = aS * C_t * S_t / (hS + S_t)
- Keep:
  predF_t = F_t * (1 - exp(-qF))
  predS_t = S_t * (1 - exp(-qS))
- Properties:
  - Monotone in both prey and predator; saturates in predator density at aF * C_t (and similarly for slow coral).
  - Near-zero prey, predation ~ O(F^2), acting like a refuge/Type III shape, which is ecologically reasonable.
  - Units remain consistent (hF, hS in percent; C_t in ind/m^2).

Expected effects on fit and dynamics:
- Stronger, earlier COTS booms when coral is abundant, improving magnitude/timing of peaks.
- Greater coral loss during outbreaks, consistent with observed crash phases.
- The BH step for adults and softplus non-negativity maintain stability and numerical robustness.

No parameter additions/modifications:
- aF, aS, hF, hS, and other parameters retain their current meanings and bounds.
- If residuals later suggest over-aggressive predation at low coral cover, a shape parameter p (Type III exponent) could be added as a future extension.

VALIDATION PLAN (post-change):
- Inspect residuals vs. time for all series; expect reduced positive residuals for COTS at outbreak onset, reduced negative residuals for fast coral during peaks.
- Check peak timing via cross-correlation of predicted vs observed COTS.
- Perform sensitivity to hF/hS to ensure identifiable prey saturation scales.

Data leakage note:
- All transitions use only previous-step states and forcings from [t-1, t); no current data values are used in predictions.
