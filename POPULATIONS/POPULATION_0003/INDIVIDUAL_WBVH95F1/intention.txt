Assessment and rationale for improvement (PROJECT CONTEXT: episodic COTS outbreaks on GBR)

A) Current model fit
- I do not have access to the residuals file in this chat. Please provide it to enable a quantitative assessment of fit (timing, magnitude, duration of peaks; autocorrelation in residuals; bias by state).
- Qualitative expectations to check once residuals are available:
  - Adult COTS peaks: Are maxima under- or over-predicted? Are declines after peaks too slow (indicative of overly compensatory crowding)?
  - Coral cover dynamics: Do fast vs slow coral residuals show systematic misfit during/after outbreaks (e.g., fast coral collapsing too little/too late)?
  - Temporal structure: Presence of positive residual autocorrelation at outbreak onset/decline would suggest missing nonlinearity or delayed density dependence.

B) Alignment with project context (strengths and gaps)
- Strengths:
  - Includes fertilization Allee effect, temperature-modified larval survival, food limitation of survival and fecundity, selective predation on two coral groups, and immigration saturation. These are core to outbreak initiation and coral impacts.
  - Smooth capping and boundedness avoid numerical artifacts and make the model stable for inference.
- Gaps that can hinder boom–bust realism:
  - Adult self-limitation uses Beverton–Holt (BH), which is strictly compensatory. BH dampens peaks but does not generate strong post-peak collapses typical of COTS busts.
  - No explicit runoff/nutrient pulses for larval food (a known trigger of episodic high recruitment), unless implicitly contained in cotsimm_dat.
  - Coral thermal stress is symmetric Gaussian; real bleaching tends to be asymmetric (hot extremes cause disproportionate losses).
  - No explicit stage structure or predator control on COTS; these could be added later but increase complexity and data needs.

C) Parameters review
- Many parameters are tagged as “initial estimate”; none are flagged as updated_from_literature=true in the provided file. Without new evidence, I retain numeric values.
- beta_dd was originally described for a Beverton–Holt form. Given the project’s emphasis on boom–bust cycles, a Ricker-type overcompensatory term is more ecologically appropriate for adult crowding after large cohorts recruit. This necessitates updating the description and plausible upper bound.

Chosen improvement: Replace Beverton–Holt with Ricker adult crowding
- Ecological reasoning:
  - At high adult densities, increased intraspecific interference, disease, resource limitation, and enhanced predation can cause overcompensation—where higher current abundance leads to proportionally lower next-year abundance. Ricker dynamics capture this and are commonly used to represent overcompensatory population regulation.
  - This mechanism sharpens the crash phase after an outbreak, improving representation of boom–bust timing and duration without adding new state variables or exogenous drivers.
- Mathematical change:
  - Before: C_{t+1} = C_raw / (1 + beta_dd * C_raw)  // Beverton–Holt (compensatory)
  - After:  C_{t+1} = C_raw * exp( -beta_dd * C_raw ) // Ricker (allows overcompensation)
  - Units remain consistent if C_raw is in ind m^-2 and beta_dd in m^2 ind^-1 so that the exponent is dimensionless.
- Parameter update:
  - beta_dd.description updated to “Ricker crowding coefficient…”
  - beta_dd.upper_bound relaxed to 5.0 to accommodate potentially stronger overcompensation; lower_bound remains 0.0.
- Data integrity:
  - No data leakage introduced; predictions depend only on previous state predictions and exogenous drivers at time t.
- Expected effects on fit (to validate with residuals):
  - Sharper declines after peaks, reduced positive residuals immediately post-peak if previously under-crashing.
  - Potentially more realistic oscillations in adult COTS, which could align outbreak duration with observations.

Future candidates (if residuals suggest remaining biases; not implemented here to keep scope focused):
- Add an environmental pulse modifier for larval survival linked to runoff/chlorophyll (if data available), to better time outbreaks.
- Introduce asymmetric thermal stress for corals (hot-side penalty) to better capture bleaching-induced losses.
- Consider a one-year juvenile stage (delay) to encode cohort echo dynamics if timing remains off.

Action items completed:
- Implemented Ricker crowding in model.cpp.
- Updated beta_dd description and bounds in parameters.json.
- Documented assessment and justification in this intention.txt.

Please share the residuals file so I can verify improvements and, if needed, iterate on mechanism choice.
