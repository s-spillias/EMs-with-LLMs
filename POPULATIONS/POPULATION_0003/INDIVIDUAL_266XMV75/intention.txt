Model Assessment and Ecological Improvement Rationale:

Assessment:
- The current model captures boomâ€“bust cycles but the logistic outbreak trigger appears too smooth.
- Residual analysis indicates that the model underestimates rapid outbreak escalation when coral resource availability is high.
- While the resource limitation function accounts for saturation, it may not fully capture synergistic effects at high coral cover.

Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce a quadratic adjustment factor to the outbreak trigger. When the resource availability (reflected by coral coverage) exceeds the threshold, the quadratic term amplifies the outbreak growth.
- This additional term (scaled by the new parameter poly_coeff) is ecologically justified by the abrupt and intense outbreak episodes observed in the Great Barrier Reef.
