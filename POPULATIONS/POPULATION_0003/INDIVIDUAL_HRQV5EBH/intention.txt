Assessment and Improvement Justification:
------------------------------------------
1. Model Assessment:
   - The current model reasonably simulates boom‐bust cycles of COTS outbreaks with selective coral predation.
   - However, the parameter "threshold" was defined but not used in triggering outbreak dynamics.
   - Residual analysis (from the residuals file) suggests that outbreak onset timing is sometimes mis‐estimated.

2. Ecological Improvement:
   - We introduce a logistic outbreak trigger. Instead of directly scaling growth by resource limitation,
     we compute an outbreak factor: outbreak_factor = 1 / (1 + exp(-outbreak_steepness*(resource_limitation - threshold))).
   - Ecologically, this represents that outbreaks only occur once resource availability crosses a critical threshold,
     with the sensitivity of the transition controlled by outbreak_steepness.
   - This refinement better captures the conditions under which COTS outbreaks rapidly expand.

3. Documentation:
   - A new parameter "log_outbreak_steepness" (in parameters.json) is added with ecological justification.
   - The model has been updated to reflect this improved dynamics.
