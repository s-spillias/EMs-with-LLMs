Below are the changes I propose. They implement an ecological improvement by introducing a non‐linear, logistic outbreak trigger. In the model we now compute an “outbreak factor” that smoothly ramps up the effective growth rate when the resource availability (represented by the saturating ratio) exceeds a threshold. This approach prevents abrupt transitions while capturing
the ecological phenomenon that outbreaks only trigger when coral resources are sufficiently abundant. We add a new parameter (log_outbreak_steepness) to control the sensitivity of this trigger. Note that we use only previous time step values everywhere, avoiding data leakage.

 1. Model Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    - The current model reasonably simulates boom‐bust cycles of COTS outbreaks with selective coral predation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    - However, the parameter "threshold" was defined but not used in triggering outbreak dynamics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
    - Residual analysis (from the residuals file) suggests that outbreak onset timing is sometimes mis‐estimated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 2. Ecological Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
    - We introduce a logistic outbreak trigger. Instead of directly scaling growth by resource limitation,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
      we compute an outbreak factor: outbreak_factor = 1 / (1 + exp(-outbreak_steepness*(resource_limitation - threshold))).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
    - Ecologically, this represents that outbreaks only occur once resource availability crosses a critical threshold,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
      with the sensitivity of the transition controlled by outbreak_steepness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
    - This refinement better captures the conditions under which COTS outbreaks rapidly expand.
