After reviewing the residuals, the model shows systematic deviations during outbreak transitions. The current formulation uses fixed predation efficiency for slow-growing coral, which may oversimplify the real ecological process. Ecologically, elevated sea surface temperatures can stress slow-growing coral, making them more susceptible to predation. To address this, we introduce a temperature-dependent modifier for the predation efficiency on slow-growing coral. This improvement should allow the model to capture temperature-driven vulnerability, resulting in more accurate boom-bust cycle predictions.
