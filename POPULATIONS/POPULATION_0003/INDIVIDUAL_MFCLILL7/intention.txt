Assessment and rationale for model update (COTS outbreak dynamics)

1) Data fit (based on available information)
- The residuals file was not provided here. Typical issues with Beverton–Holt (BH) crowding in outbreak systems include underpredicted peaks and overly smooth adult trajectories, because BH is strictly compensatory and dampens oscillations.
- Given the PROJECT CONTEXT (episodic outbreaks with sharp rises and declines), this model structure likely struggles to reproduce strong boom–bust cycles without an overcompensatory mechanism.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
Strengths:
- Includes temperature-dependent performance for larvae and corals.
- Captures selective predation on fast vs slow coral groups with flexible (Type II/III) functional responses and preference.
- Includes food limitation feedback on adult survival via total coral cover.
- Allows exogenous larval input via an immigration driver.

Limitations:
- Adult crowding uses Beverton–Holt, which cannot produce overcompensation or cycles; outbreaks tend to be muted.
- No explicit settlement bottleneck or episodic recruitment pulse generator beyond the provided immigration input.
- No maturation delay/state structure that can amplify cycles (not changed here to keep complexity low).

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Overcompensatory density dependence at early post-settlement stages (disease, cannibalism, substrate limitation) that can crash cohorts after peaks.
- Episodic nutrient/runoff-driven larval survival pulses (not available in current inputs).
- Stage structure (juveniles) and time lags that can induce multi-year cycles.
- Disturbance-mediated coral recovery lags (e.g., delayed regrowth after predation/bleaching).

4) Parameter review
- Most parameters are initial estimates with plausible bounds. Literature-derived values for temperature responses appear reasonable.
- The BH crowding coefficient (beta_dd) was previously tied to 1/(1 + beta*N). For outbreak dynamics, a Ricker-type structure is more appropriate.

5) Chosen ecological improvement
Introduce theta-Ricker self-limitation for adult COTS:
C_{t+1} = C_raw_{t+1} * exp(-beta_dd * C_raw_{t+1}^{dd_theta}),
where C_raw_{t+1} = survival + recruitment + immigration (pre-crowding).

Justification:
- Ricker-type overcompensation is a parsimonious mechanism to generate boom–bust cycles consistent with observed COTS dynamics.
- dd_theta allows flexible curvature: classic Ricker (dd_theta=1) or stronger-than-linear crowding (dd_theta>1).
- Applies where ecologically plausible (post-recruitment/settlement bottleneck), without introducing latent states or new forcings.

6) Implementation details
- Added parameter dd_theta (>=0, upper bound 2.0 for identifiability).
- Reinterpreted beta_dd to match Ricker exponent (units ~ ind^-dd_theta).
- Numerical stability: use (C_raw_next + eps) in exponent, keep existing eps floors and smooth clamping.
- No data leakage: predictions use only previous predicted states and exogenous drivers.

7) Expected effects on fit and dynamics
- Greater ability to match rapid outbreak growth and subsequent sharp declines.
- Potential for multi-year oscillations when supported by data (values of beta_dd and dd_theta control amplitude/duration).
- If residuals later indicate poor timing of peaks, consider adding a maturation delay or an environmental pulse driver for recruitment.

8) Next steps for validation (after refit)
- Examine residuals for: peak under/over-shoots, autocorrelation, and mismatch in bust duration.
- Profile dd_theta and beta_dd for identifiability; check for correlations with fec and alpha_imm.
- Compare AIC/BIC vs BH formulation to confirm value added by overcompensation.
