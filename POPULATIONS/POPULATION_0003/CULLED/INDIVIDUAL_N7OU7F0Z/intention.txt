Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model does not incorporate environmental modulation via sea surface temperature (SST) despite having the effect_sst parameter. Residual analysis indicates systematic deviations during warmer periods, suggesting that temperature enhances outbreak growth. To better capture the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks, we now modify the intrinsic growth rate by multiplying it by an exponential function of the previous time stepâ€™s SST (i.e. exp(effect_sst * sst_dat(t-1))). This adjustment is ecologically justified as warmer conditions can amplify metabolic and reproductive rates, thereby increasing outbreak intensity under favorable conditions. This improvement introduces non-linearity that more closely captures the complex interplay between environmental conditions and population dynamics, without risking data leakage.
