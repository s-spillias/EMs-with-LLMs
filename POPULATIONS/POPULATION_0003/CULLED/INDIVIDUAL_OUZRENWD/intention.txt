Assessment:
- The current model successfully captures boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks using growth, decline, and a resource limitation based on coral cover.
- However, the influence of sea surface temperature (SST)—a key environmental factor known to modulate outbreak triggering and progression—is not explicitly represented.
Improvement:
- We now introduce an environmental modifier by computing a temperature_factor (using the previous time step's SST) that adjusts the effective growth rate.
- This change captures the ecological reality where warm conditions may exacerbate outbreak dynamics, while ensuring no data leakage (only using past SST values).
