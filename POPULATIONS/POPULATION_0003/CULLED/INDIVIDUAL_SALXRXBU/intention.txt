Assessment of the current model:
The present formulation uses a simple saturating function (coral_total/(coral_total+saturation)) to represent resource limitation. However, episodic outbreaks of Crown‐of‐Thorns starfish may involve sharp transitions in coral availability, triggering rapid boom–bust cycles. 

Proposed improvement:
We incorporate a Hill function into the resource limitation mechanism:
    resource_limitation = [coral_total^hill_exponent] / ([coral_total^hill_exponent] + [saturation^hill_exponent])
This formulation introduces a threshold effect where slight changes in coral cover can lead to a rapid change in available resources and thus outbreak dynamics. The new parameter “hill_exponent” controls the steepness of this non-linear response.

Key ecological justification:
• Enhances the realism of switching behavior in response to critical coral cover thresholds.
• Captures the potential for sudden outbreak triggers that are observed in field data.
• Avoids data leakage by only using previous time step values.
