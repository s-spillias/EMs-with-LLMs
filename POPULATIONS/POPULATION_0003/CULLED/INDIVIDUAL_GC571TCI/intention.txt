Assessment:
The current model captures boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks using resource limitation and coral predation. However, residual analysis indicates that thermal conditions materially affect outbreak timing and magnitude—an ecological process that has been oversimplified in the current formulation.

Chosen improvement:
Incorporate a non-linear environmental modifier by modulating the intrinsic growth rate with sea surface temperature (SST). Specifically, we compute:
    effective_growth = growth_rate * exp(effect_sst * sst_dat(t-1))
where sst_dat(t-1) is the SST (°C) from the previous time step. This reflects how higher temperatures can accelerate metabolic processes, leading to more rapid outbreak expansion.

Implementation:
- In model.cpp, replace the growth term with one using effective_growth.
- In parameters.json, update the effect_sst parameter description to clarify its role in modulating growth.
