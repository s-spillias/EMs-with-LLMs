This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
It captures boom‐bust cycles whereby COTS numbers rapidly surge (outbreak) and then decline.
Key mechanisms include:
1. Density‐dependent growth with a logistic framework and an outbreak boost triggered by high sea surface temperatures (SST).
2. A smooth, threshold‐modulated response for outbreak initiation to ensure numerical stability.
3. Selective predation on coral communities: fast-growing Acropora species and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites, which feed back to affect COTS dynamics.
4. Recursive prediction using only previous time step values to avoid leakage.
Robust numerical techniques (small constants, smooth transitions) and lognormal likelihoods stabilize estimation.
