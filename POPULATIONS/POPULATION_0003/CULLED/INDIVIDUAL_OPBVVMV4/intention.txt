ASSESSMENT AND RATIONALE

Data fit
- Limitation: A residuals file was referenced but not provided here, so I cannot quantify fit quality or diagnose specific misfit patterns (timing, magnitude, duration of outbreaks).
- Request: Please share the residuals file to assess whether the model under/over-predicts (a) outbreak onsets, (b) outbreak peaks, or (c) decay phases, and whether there are systematic biases in coral composition.

Alignment with project context
- Strengths: The model already captures key drivers:
  - Fertilization Allee effect (phi_spawn), temperature responses for larvae and corals (Gaussian), selective predation with preference for Acropora, space-limited coral growth, food-limited adult survival via total coral, Beverton–Holt crowding on adult COTS, and optional Type II/III functional response (q).
- Gaps for episodic outbreaks:
  1) Missing indirect pathway: juvenile-to-adult transition likely depends on Acropora availability. High Acropora promotes successful transition to coral-feeding stages; when Acropora is depleted by outbreaks, subsequent transition is suppressed. This feedback helps produce boom-bust dynamics.
  2) No explicit juvenile stage or delay; current recruitment is immediate to adults after one year, driven by adult density and SST only.
  3) No nutrient/chlorophyll effects on larval survival (often implicated in outbreak initiation), but these covariates are not part of the current data interface.
  4) Preference (wA) is fixed rather than adaptive to availability; acceptable for parsimony unless residuals suggest otherwise.

Ecological processes potentially oversimplified
- Juvenile bottleneck is not represented (no stage structure), and adult survival uses total coral rather than composition-weighted food availability. Temperature effects are symmetric (Gaussian), which may miss warm-tail asymmetry for corals, but asymmetry is secondary to outbreak generation in this context.

Chosen improvement
- Approach: Environmental modifier/indirect pathway via resource limitation.
- Change: Introduce an Acropora-mediated juvenile transition filter on recruitment:
  - phi_juv(A_t) = A_t / (k_juv + A_t), where A_t is fast coral (%) at time t.
  - recruits(t) = fec * C_t * phi_spawn(t) * phi_T_COTS(t) * phi_juv(A_t)
- Justification: This adds a biologically grounded positive feedback:
  - When Acropora is abundant, more juveniles transition to adults, enabling outbreaks.
  - During/after outbreaks, Acropora declines due to selective predation, suppressing future recruitment and creating a bust phase.
  - This mechanism helps align model dynamics with observed pulsed, self-limiting outbreaks without requiring unobserved nutrient covariates.
- Parameterization:
  - New parameter: k_juv (units: % fast coral cover), half-saturation of Acropora effect.
  - Suggested bounds: 0.1–50% (mirrors other half-saturation scales and typical Acropora cover ranges).
  - Identifiability: Supported by joint time series of COTS and coral composition.
- Data leakage check: phi_juv uses predicted A_t (fast_pred), not fast_dat, and only from previous time step, satisfying the no-leakage requirement.

Expected effects on dynamics and diagnostics
- Increases outbreak likelihood when Acropora is high, amplifying peaks without permanently destabilizing dynamics (as crowding and food feedback still operate).
- Tightens coupling between coral composition and COTS boom-bust cycles, likely improving residuals around outbreak onset/peak if current model underpredicts those phases.
- Residual patterns to check post-fit:
  - Reduced positive residuals during outbreak onset and peaks for COTS.
  - Improved timing alignment between Acropora declines and COTS peaks.
  - No induced bias in slow coral trajectories beyond expected selective predation effects.

Next steps
- Please provide the residuals file to validate whether this addition resolves misfit at outbreak transitions. If residuals still show timing lags, consider (a) a one-year maturation delay or (b) an asymmetric temperature response for corals as subsequent refinements.
