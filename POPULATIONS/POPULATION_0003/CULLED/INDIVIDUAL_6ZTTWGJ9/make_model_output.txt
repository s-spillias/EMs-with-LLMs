Below is our proposed update to improve the ecological realism. We add a saturating functional response in the coral predation equations (using a Michaelis–Menten form) so that at high COTS densities the per‐capita predation effect on corals saturates. This change is ecologically justified because predators typically become less efficient as densities increase. We also add
a new parameter, predation_saturation, in the parameters file with an ecological justification, and update the intention file to record our assessment. Remember: current time step response variables are not used in predictions (only previous time step values are used).

 1. The current model captures COTS outbreak dynamics by combining exponential growth (modulated by sea surface temperature) and resource limitation. However, the model employs a linear predation effect on coral communities.                                                                                                                                                       
 2. Empirical evidence suggests that predation efficiency saturates as predator density increases; hence, a linear approach may overestimate coral loss during large outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 3. To address this, we introduce a non-linear (Michaelis–Menten) functional response in predation, where the effect of COTS on both fast- and slow-growing corals is dampened at high predator densities.                                                                                                                                                                             
 4. This extra complexity is ecologically meaningful, as it better captures the observed boom-bust dynamics by incorporating the limit to predation efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 5. A new parameter, "predation_saturation", has been added to model this saturating effect.
