PROJECT CONTEXT ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT:
1. The current model captures COTS outbreak dynamics by combining exponential growth (modulated by sea surface temperature) and resource limitation. However, the model employs a linear predation effect on coral communities.
2. Empirical evidence suggests that predation efficiency saturates as predator density increases; hence, a linear approach may overestimate coral loss during large outbreaks.
3. To address this, we introduce a non-linear (Michaelisâ€“Menten) functional response in predation, where the effect of COTS on both fast- and slow-growing corals is dampened at high predator densities.
4. This extra complexity is ecologically meaningful, as it better captures the observed boom-bust dynamics by incorporating the limit to predation efficiency.
5. A new parameter, "predation_saturation", has been added to model this saturating effect.
