Assessment and Reasoning:
--------------------------
The current model uses saturating resource limitation and environmental modifiers to drive COTS outbreak dynamics.
However, it does not incorporate an explicit threshold mechanism to trigger outbreaks. 
Booster events in COTS outbreaks are often linked to sudden increases in available coral resources. 
To more accurately model the timing and magnitude of these outbreaks, we have introduced a threshold effect 
by implementing a sigmoid function of aggregate (past) coral cover. This function, modulated by a new parameter 
("threshold_steepness"), allows the model to transition rapidly from low to high outbreak growth when coral cover 
exceeds a critical level (interpreted via the "log_threshold" parameter). This approach enhances the ecological 
realism by linking outbreak triggers to resource availability while ensuring no data leakage by using only previous time step values.
