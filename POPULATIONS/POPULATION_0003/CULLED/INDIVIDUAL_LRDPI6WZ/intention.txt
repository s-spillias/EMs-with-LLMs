This TMB model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. 
It captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles by dynamically modeling threshold-driven larval immigration, 
environmentally mediated growth, and selective predation on coral communities (fast-growing Acropora vs. slow-growing Faviidae and Porites). 
Key ecological processes include saturating resource limitations, smooth transitions to prevent numerical instabilities, 
and feedback loops between COTS abundance and coral cover.
