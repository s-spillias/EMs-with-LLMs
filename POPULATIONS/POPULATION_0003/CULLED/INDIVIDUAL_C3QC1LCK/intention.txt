Purpose: Predict episodic Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks (timing, magnitude, duration) and their consequences for coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef by mechanistically coupling predator dynamics with prey (coral) dynamics and environmental forcing.

Ecological functioning (concise):
- State variables: adult COTS abundance (individuals/m2), fast-growing coral cover (Acropora, %), and slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae/Porites, %).
- Forcing: sea-surface temperature (SST, °C) modifies rates; external larval immigration (ind/m2/yr) provides episodic recruitment pulses.
- Coral dynamics: Each coral group grows logistically with total coral competition. Growth is temperature-modulated (Gaussian peak around thermal optima) and suffers background mortality plus additional smooth bleaching mortality that increases with warm SST. COTS predation is a multi-prey Holling type II functional response with prey selectivity (higher on fast corals), handling times, and low-cover refugia represented by soft thresholds.
- COTS dynamics: Adult numbers follow a survival-plus-recruitment balance. Annual survival depends smoothly on temperature (Gaussian around an optimum), food availability (saturating function of coral cover), and density dependence. Recruitment combines (i) internal production proportional to adult stock and food/SST suitability (saturating) and (ii) external larval immigration (forcing) scaled by a settlement-to-adult efficiency, with a 1-year lag to ensure realistic outbreak timing.
- Outbreak mechanism: Outbreaks are triggered and sustained when immigration pulses coincide with favorable temperatures and abundant preferred coral cover, producing rapid COTS increases via positive feedback (more adults → more internal recruits). Busts occur as predation depletes coral (reducing food-dependent survival/recruitment), combined with density dependence and potentially suboptimal SST, causing population collapse.
- Numerical safeguards: All transitions use smooth, saturating functions and small constants to prevent division by zero; parameters are softly penalized to remain within biologically meaningful ranges; observations are fit with lognormal errors and minimum standard deviations to ensure stability.
