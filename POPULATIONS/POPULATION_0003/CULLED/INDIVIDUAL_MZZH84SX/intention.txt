Assessment and Ecological Improvement:
The residuals indicate that the current model underpredicts the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks.
The model presently employs a saturating function for coral resource limitation and exponential outbreak dynamics,
but it does not incorporate environmental variability despite having an `effect_sst` parameter.
To better simulate the boom‚Äêbust cycles observed on the Great Barrier Reef, we now incorporate the influence of sea surface
temperature (SST) into the outbreak growth. The intrinsic growth rate is modulated by SST deviations from a baseline value,
thereby capturing thermal anomalies that can trigger outbreak events.
This modification improves ecological realism, acknowledging that warmer-than-average conditions can accelerate outbreak dynamics.
