 1 We'll update intention.txt to document our assessment and the ecological reasoning behind incorporating an environmental modifier. This update explains that residuals indicate underprediction of outbreak timing/magnitude and that adding an SST effect into the growth term aids in capturing thermal anomalies triggering outbreaks.                                           
 2 In model.cpp we modify the outbreak dynamics so that the intrinsic growth rate is modulated by the sea surface temperature from the previous time step. We implement this by multiplying growth_rate by (1 + effect_sst*(sst_dat(t-1) - baseline_sst)). This avoids data leakage (using previous time step values) and better represents the environmental effects.                 
 3 In parameters.json we add a new parameter, baseline_sst, with a value of 25.0 °C. This parameter provides a reference temperature to interpret the effect_sst modifier.

 The residuals indicate that the current model underpredicts the magnitude and timing of COTS outbreaks.

 but it does not incorporate environmental variability despite having an `effect_sst` parameter.

The intrinsic growth rate is modulated by SST deviations from a baseline value,
