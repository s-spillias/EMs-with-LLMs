Below is our plan. We have assessed that while the current model captures the basic boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks, the use of observed coral cover values in the resource limitation term may lead to data leakage. To address this, we update the model so that resource limitation is computed from previous predictions (i.e. using fast_pred and slow_pred) rather than the 
observed values. In addition, we introduce a nonlinear resource uptake by adding a new parameter, log_resource_exponent, which allows flexible nonlinearity in the saturating function. This improvement captures ecological threshold and competition effects more realistically.

 After evaluating the model, we observed that while it captures the general outbreak cycles, it uses observed coral cover values (fast_dat and slow_dat) in computations for resource limitation. This may lead to data leakage. To prevent this and to better encapsulate the ecological dynamics, we now use predicted coral cover (fast_pred and slow_pred) for the resource        
 limitation calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 Furthermore, an additional parameter, log_resource_exponent, is introduced to allow a nonlinear (power‐law) transformation in the resource limitation function. This parameter can capture threshold effects and competitive interactions among corals, providing more flexibility to model complex ecological responses.
