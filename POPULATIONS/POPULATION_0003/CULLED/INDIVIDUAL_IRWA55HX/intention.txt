Assessment and Reasoning:
After evaluating the model, we observed that while it captures the general outbreak cycles, it uses observed coral cover values (fast_dat and slow_dat) in computations for resource limitation. This may lead to data leakage. To prevent this and to better encapsulate the ecological dynamics, we now use predicted coral cover (fast_pred and slow_pred) for the resource limitation calculation.
Furthermore, an additional parameter, log_resource_exponent, is introduced to allow a nonlinear (power‚Äêlaw) transformation in the resource limitation function. This parameter can capture threshold effects and competitive interactions among corals, providing more flexibility to model complex ecological responses.
