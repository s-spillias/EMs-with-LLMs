Assessment and rationale

1) Model fit to data
- Residuals: A residuals file was referenced but not available in this context. Without it, I cannot quantify lack-of-fit or diagnose time-specific biases. Please share residuals to refine diagnostics (e.g., phase lag, amplitude errors, serial correlation).
- Qualitative expectations: Given the current structure, the model likely reproduces smooth COTS dynamics because recruitment instantly converts to adults. Outbreaks in COTS tend to exhibit lagged pulses (1–3 years) between environmental conditions and adult population explosions; immediate recruitment-to-adult conversion can cause timing mismatches and overly damped cycles.

2) Alignment with project context
- Strengths: The model includes selective predation on two coral functional groups with saturating functional responses and preference, temperature modifiers for larval and coral performance, food limitation via total coral cover on COTS survival, immigration, and Beverton–Holt crowding. These elements support boom–bust dynamics and food-driven collapse after outbreaks.
- Gaps: A key driver of episodic outbreaks is the delayed maturation from settlement to adults (approximately 2–3 years), coupled with environmentally modulated early survival. The current one-compartment adult model collapses this lag into an instantaneous “effective fecundity,” which limits the model’s ability to generate and time outbreak pulses realistically.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Stage structure and time delay: No explicit juvenile/subadult pool; recruitment is added directly to adults. This likely smooths boom–bust cycles and misaligns outbreak timing.
- Environmental triggers for pulses: Temperature affects larval performance (phi_T_COTS), and food affects adult survival and effective fecundity, but early-stage (juvenile) survival is not explicitly modeled though it is critical for outbreak initiation.
- Optional additional considerations (not implemented here to preserve parsimony): Predator interference or switching, nutrient/runoff-driven larval survival pulses, stochastic process noise.

Chosen improvement: Add a juvenile maturation delay with food- and temperature-dependent survival

Ecological reasoning
- COTS take roughly 2–3 years to reach reproductive adult size; early stages are sensitive to food availability and environmental conditions. A juvenile pool with survival and maturation generates distributed time delays that help produce episodic pulses without relying on ad hoc shocks.
- Implementing a two-stage juvenile pipeline (J1, J2) introduces a ~2-year lag from local production to adult recruitment. Early survival is modulated by temperature and food, consistent with known outbreak triggers.

Mathematical changes
- Previous: Adults at t+1 received recruits(t) directly.
- New:
  - Compute “recruits to juvenile pool” at time t: R_J(t) = fec_eff(t) * C_t * phi_spawn(t) * phi_T_COTS(t).
  - Two juvenile stages:
    - J1_{t+1} = R_J(t)
    - J2_{t+1} = sJ(t) * J1_t + (1 - p_mat) * sJ(t) * J2_t
      where sJ(t) = sJ0 * phi_T_COTS(t) * phi_food(t)
  - Adult addition from maturation:
    - M_{t+1} = p_mat * sJ(t) * J2_t
  - Adults update:
    - C_raw_{t+1} = C_surv(t) + M_{t+1} + I(t)
    - C_{t+1} = C_raw_{t+1} / (1 + beta_dd * C_raw_{t+1})

Parameter updates
- fec: Semantics updated to represent production of juveniles entering the juvenile pipeline (rather than direct adults).
- Added:
  - sJ0 (0–1): baseline annual juvenile survival multiplier, modulated by temperature and food.
  - p_mat (0–1): annual maturation probability from late juvenile (J2) to adults; p_mat ~ 1 implies ≈2-year delay, smaller values produce broader, longer delays.

Tradeoffs and parsimony
- This adds only two parameters and a modest state extension while directly addressing outbreak timing and amplitude. It avoids introducing unobserved exogenous pulses or heavy stochasticity, and remains compatible with existing data inputs (no data leakage).

Next steps (recommended once residuals are available)
- Check for phase lag reduction and improved peak amplitude timing in COTS residuals.
- If amplitude remains biased, consider allowing sJ0 or p_mat to vary with additional covariates (e.g., runoff/nutrients) or include mild process noise on juvenile survival.
