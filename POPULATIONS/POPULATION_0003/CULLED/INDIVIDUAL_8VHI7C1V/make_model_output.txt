Creating empty file POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0003/INDIVIDUAL_8VHI7C1V/intention.txt
Below is our plan: We will document our model assessment and rationale in the intention.txt file, add a new parameter (cots_carrying_capacity) to parameters.json—with ecological justification—and update model.cpp by (a) extracting the new parameter and (b) modifying the COTS dynamics to include resource limitation via a carrying capacity. This extra nonlinear term will    
help dampen explosive growth as the population nears environmental limits, leading to more realistic boom–bust cycles in line with the project context.

 The residual analysis suggests that while the model captures outbreak timing reasonably well, the explosion phase is overly exponential. This is due to a lack of resource limitation in the COTS dynamics.

 We introduce a carrying capacity parameter ("cots_carrying_capacity") into the COTS growth equation. This factor represents the environmental limits and intraspecific competition that curb growth as populations near their resource limits. Ecologically, this approach helps capture the boom–bust cycles by ensuring that once COTS numbers become high, growth is tempered,     
 leading to more realistic outbreak magnitude and duration.
