Assessment:
The residual analysis suggests that while the model captures outbreak timing reasonably well, the explosion phase is overly exponential. This is due to a lack of resource limitation in the COTS dynamics.

Chosen Improvement:
We introduce a carrying capacity parameter ("cots_carrying_capacity") into the COTS growth equation. This factor represents the environmental limits and intraspecific competition that curb growth as populations near their resource limits. Ecologically, this approach helps capture the boomâ€“bust cycles by ensuring that once COTS numbers become high, growth is tempered, leading to more realistic outbreak magnitude and duration.
