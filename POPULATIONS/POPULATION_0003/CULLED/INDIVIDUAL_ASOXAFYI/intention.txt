Assessment and rationale

1) Fit to data
- A residuals file was referenced but not provided here, so I cannot quantify fit. In similar COTS applications, models with immediate recruitment to adults and Beverton–Holt crowding often under-predict peak magnitude and delay outbreak onset. They also tend to smooth boom–bust transitions.
- Given the current structure and typical COTS dynamics, likely issues include:
  - Underestimation of rapid increases (outbreak onset).
  - Peaks that are too broad (insufficient pulsing).
  - Timing mismatches around known nutrient/larval supply events.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model captures many essentials: selective predation on coral groups, temperature-modified performance, food limits on adult survival and fecundity, and saturating immigration.
- However, outbreak timing on the GBR is strongly linked to episodic increases in larval survival driven by nutrient/runoff events, which are not explicitly modulating local recruitment here. This omission can limit accurate prediction of boom initiation.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Episodic larval survival pulses (linked to nutrients/runoff) are not represented in local recruitment; immigration is saturating but does not modulate local production.
- Maturation delay (juveniles taking 2–3 years to reach adulthood) is not represented; recruits immediately enter the adult stage, which can dampen pulses.
- No explicit disturbance shocks (cyclone, bleaching) on coral; not addressed here to keep scope focused.

Chosen improvement (one change)
- Add an environmental modifier on local recruitment that leverages the available cotsimm_dat time series as a proxy for larval environment quality (nutrients/larval supply). This directly targets outbreak timing while preserving model parsimony.
- Mathematical form:
  - phi_env_rec(t) = cotsimm_dat(t) / (k_rec + cotsimm_dat(t))
  - M_env(t) = 1 + alpha_rec_env * (2 * phi_env_rec(t) - 1)  in [1 - alpha_rec_env, 1 + alpha_rec_env]
  - recruits(t) = fec_eff(t) * C_t * phi_spawn(t) * phi_T_COTS(t) * M_env(t)
- This introduces bounded amplification/damping around baseline recruitment using an exogenous proxy. High phi_env_rec produces multiplicative boosts; low values dampen recruitment. This allows rapid, episodic increases consistent with observed boom triggers and sustains realism by limiting extreme growth.

Why this and not a more complex change?
- Alternatives considered:
  - Stage structure (juvenile delay): ecologically appealing and likely beneficial but adds an additional state (or queue) and parameters; without strong data support, this increases identifiability risks.
  - Overcompensatory adult density dependence (Ricker): can create oscillations but risks unrealistic crashes and chaotic dynamics if not carefully constrained, and may conflate larval process pulses with adult regulation.
  - Additional environmental drivers on coral or mortality: important but secondary for capturing outbreak initiation.
- The selected change is a minimal extension that directly targets outbreak timing and magnitude using an available covariate, improving boom-bust realism with limited added complexity.

Parameter updates
- Added:
  - alpha_rec_env (dimensionless, [0,1]): amplitude of environmental recruitment modulation.
  - k_rec (same units as cotsimm_dat): half-saturation mapping the environmental proxy into phi_env_rec.
- Initial values set to 0.6 and 0.5 respectively (aligned with k_imm scale), with biologically plausible bounds. These can be tuned by fitting.
- No other parameter values were changed. If literature updates provide tighter constraints, consider narrowing bounds for Topt_cots and sigmaT terms or revisiting fec interpretation once recruitment pulses are evaluated.

Notes
- No data leakage: only previous state predictions and exogenous covariates at time t are used in computing t+1 states.
- If residuals indicate persistent timing lags or underestimation of peaks even after this change, the next step would be to introduce a simple one- or two-year maturation delay to add cohort resonance, which often improves outbreak phasing.
- Please provide the residuals file to confirm whether this change addresses the observed misfits and to guide further targeted refinements.
