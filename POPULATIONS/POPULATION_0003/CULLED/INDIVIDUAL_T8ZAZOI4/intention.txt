Assessment and Improvement:
1. The current model fits the data reasonably well but appears to underestimate the rapid threshold dynamics observed in COTS outbreaks.
2. While the model accounts for resource limitation using a saturating function, ecological processes suggest a sharper, threshold‚Äêlike transition in available coral resources may exist.
3. To capture this, a nonlinear resource limitation function with a power-law exponent (p_resource) is introduced. This parameter allows the model to more accurately represent the abrupt shift from low to high outbreak risk when coral cover exceeds a critical level.
4. This refinement directly addresses the project context by more precisely capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events.
