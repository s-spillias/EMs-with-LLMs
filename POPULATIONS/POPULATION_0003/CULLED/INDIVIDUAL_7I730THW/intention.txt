ASSESSMENT

1) Model fit to data
- I do not see a residuals file in the provided project files, so I cannot quantitatively evaluate model fit (e.g., bias, autocorrelation, timing/magnitude errors). Please share the residuals output so I can comment specifically on over/under-prediction patterns and outbreak timing mismatches.
- Qualitatively, the observation models (log-normal for COTS density, logit-normal for coral proportions) are appropriate and numerically stable due to small-sample protections (eps and minimum SD floors).

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths:
  - Includes a saturating Allee-type fertilization success (phi_spawn) that can enhance recruitment at moderate densities.
  - Uses SST modifiers for both COTS larvae and corals.
  - Captures selective predation with preference and a flexible Type II/III functional response (q).
  - Includes food limitation on COTS survival via total coral cover and a simple Beverton–Holt crowding term.
  - Allows external larval immigration via a saturating term.
- Limitations for episodic outbreak dynamics:
  - Recruitment currently adds adults within the same year (no explicit pre-adult/juvenile stage), which tends to produce smoother dynamics and can miss the characteristic boom-bust episodes driven by juvenile bottlenecks and delayed maturation.
  - Without a delay/stocking of juveniles, fertilization and immigration pulses may not translate into properly timed adult outbreaks.
  - The only environmental pulse driver is SST; important outbreak triggers (e.g., water-quality/nutrient pulses) are likely embedded in the immigration forcing but not explicitly delayed.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Juvenile stage structure and maturation delay: COTS typically experience high, environment-dependent juvenile mortality with delayed maturation (1–3+ years), which is a well-supported mechanism producing lagged, episodic adult outbreaks.
- Strong food dependence of juvenile survival: juveniles are more sensitive to food limitation than adults; modeling this separately improves realism of booms and busts.
- Additional candidates (not implemented now for parsimony): explicit predator control, refuge effects at low coral cover, stochastic pulse events tied to river discharge/nutrients.

PARAMETER REVIEW

- Many parameters remain “initial estimate” and not “updated from literature.” When updated values become available (e.g., max_cons, mortality rates, and environmental optima), we should revisit scaling and functional forms (e.g., magnitude of max_cons relative to coral growth).
- Current values appear reasonable as starting points (e.g., max_cons ~20% per starfish yr⁻¹; adult mortality ~0.6 yr⁻¹).
- Because adult recruitment is currently instantaneous, fec is implicitly conflating multiple processes (egg production, larval survival, settlement, early juvenile survival, maturation). Introducing a juvenile stage makes fec ecologically cleaner (larval supply entering the juvenile pool) and moves maturation into its own parameter.

ONE ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT CHOSEN

Introduce an explicit juvenile pool with delayed maturation
- Rationale: Episodic outbreaks are well explained by a juvenile bottleneck plus delay to adulthood. Pulses in larval supply (from fertilization success and/or immigration) accumulate in the juvenile pool, where survival is strongly food-dependent. A fraction matures to adults the following year(s). This delay and state accumulation produce characteristic boom-bust cycles.
- Minimal added complexity: add a single juvenile state J(t) and three parameters that are biologically interpretable: p_mat (annual maturation fraction), mJ (baseline juvenile mortality), mJ_food (extra juvenile mortality under food limitation).

MODEL CHANGES

- Before: recruits(t) = fec * C_t * phi_spawn(t) * phi_T_COTS(t) * phi_food(t)^{gamma_rec_food} + I(t) were added directly to adults at t+1.
- After: treat recruits + immigration as larval input L(t) into a juvenile pool J(t), with survival and maturation:
  L(t)     = fec * C_t * phi_spawn(t) * phi_T_COTS(t) * phi_food(t)^{gamma_rec_food} + alpha_imm * cotsimm_dat(t) / (k_imm + cotsimm_dat(t))
  sJ(t)    = exp( -[ mJ + mJ_food * (1 - phi_food(t)) ] )
  matured  = p_mat * J(t) * sJ(t)
  J(t+1)   = (1 - p_mat) * J(t) * sJ(t) + L(t)
  C_raw(t+1) = C_t * exp( -[ mC + mC_food * (1 - phi_food(t)) ] ) + matured
  C_{t+1} = C_raw(t+1) / (1 + beta_dd * C_raw(t+1))

- Initialization: J(0) is derived from t=0 drivers and states as the first larval input L(0). This uses only t=0 predicted states (which equal observed initial conditions as in the existing model) and drivers, avoiding data leakage beyond t=0.

EXPECTED EFFECTS

- Adds a biologically realistic delay between larval pulses and adult outbreaks, allowing the model to produce sharper, episodic booms followed by busts.
- Separates maturation (p_mat) and juvenile mortality (mJ, mJ_food) from fec, improving identifiability and ecological interpretation.
- Juvenile survival being food-sensitive strengthens feedback with coral cover, supporting self-limiting outbreak dynamics.

REQUEST

- Please provide the residuals file (or enable reporting of residuals) so I can quantify changes in fit (e.g., reduction in outbreak timing errors and residual autocorrelation) and tune initial values/bounds further.
