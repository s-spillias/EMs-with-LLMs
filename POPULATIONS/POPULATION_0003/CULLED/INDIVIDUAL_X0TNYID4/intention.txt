Assessment and Ecological Reasoning:
After reviewing the residuals and model performance, the current formulation underrepresents the influence of environmental stress—particularly sea surface temperature (SST)—on outbreak dynamics. To better capture the triggering and sustaining of COTS outbreaks, we introduce an environmental modifier that adjusts the intrinsic growth rate based on the previous time step's SST. This modification is ecologically justified as higher SST can exacerbate coral stress, thereby indirectly accelerating outbreak dynamics. The effective growth rate is now computed as:
    modified_growth_rate = growth_rate * exp(effect_sst * sst_dat(t-1))
which uses only past environmental data, ensuring no data leakage. This approach balances realism with mathematical tractability.
