Assessment:
The current model fits the observed outbreak cycles reasonably well, but analysis of the residuals suggests that the linear treatment of temperature effects may oversimplify the triggering conditions for outbreaks. 
Ecologically, sea surface temperature can induce threshold responses where deviations beyond a baseline trigger a rapid onset of outbreaks. To better capture this behavior, we have introduced a quadratic temperature modifier. 
The outbreak growth rate is now scaled by a temperature factor:
    temp_effect = 1 + effect_sst * (SST_prev - 27.0) + effect_sst2 * (SST_prev - 27.0)^2 
This nonlinear response is justified by observational evidence that extreme temperatures can disproportionately drive outbreak dynamics.
