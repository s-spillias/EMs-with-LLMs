Assessment:
The current model accurately captures boom‐bust cycles through resource limitation but uses a constant predation efficiency (efficiency_coral) when modeling coral consumption. Analysis of the residuals indicates that the model may underpredict outbreak magnitude during periods of low coral cover. This suggests that a nonlinear feedback—where reduced coral availability impairs predator efficiency—may be important.
Improvement:
We introduce a nonlinear feedback mechanism via a new parameter, predation_feedback_exponent, to modulate the effective predation efficiency. The effective efficiency is computed based on the previous time-step's predicted total coral cover. This approach better captures the ecological reality that depleted coral stocks reduce efficient predation, thereby influencing outbreak dynamics.
