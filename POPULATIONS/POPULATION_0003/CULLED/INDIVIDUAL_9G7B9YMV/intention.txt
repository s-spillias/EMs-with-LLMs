Assessment and rationale:

1) Fit to data
- Quantitative residual analysis could not be performed because a residuals file was not provided here. Please share it so we can examine bias, autocorrelation, and error scale.
- Qualitatively, the current structure is capable of reproducing general trends but can blur outbreak timing because recruits are added directly to the adult pool without delay. This typically leads to smoother, less episodic adult dynamics than observed for COTS.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT (episodic outbreaks; timing, magnitude, duration)
- Strengths already present: (i) fertilization Allee effect, (ii) food limitation via total coral cover, (iii) temperature dependence for larvae and corals, (iv) immigration forcing, (v) selective predation on coral groups, (vi) Beverton–Holt density dependence.
- Key gap: maturation delay from larval recruitment to adult stage. COTS generally require ~1–2 years to reach maturity; larval survival pulses induced by environmental conditions (e.g., river runoff–driven plankton blooms) translate to adult outbreaks only after a delay. Without this temporal memory, the model can miss the characteristic boom–bust pulse and misalign peaks.

3) Potentially missing or simplified ecological processes
- Not explicitly modeled: (a) juvenile/subadult stage, (b) nutrient/runoff-driven pulses in larval survival, (c) predator control or removal, (d) management culling, (e) spatial connectivity beyond an exogenous immigration index.
- Among these, adding a juvenile stage directly targets outbreak timing with minimal additional complexity and no new data requirements.

Parameter review
- Many parameters are flagged as initial estimates; none are marked updated_from_literature = true. No evidence here suggests immediate rescaling or functional form changes are required for those values. However, the direct recruitment-to-adult structure is ecologically inconsistent with the life history when outbreaks are episodic.

Chosen improvement: introduce a juvenile/subadult stage with maturation delay
- Ecological justification: COTS take multiple months to years to mature; juvenile survival and delayed maturation create “cohort resonance” that sharpens booms and supports realistic busts. Larval pulses do not instantaneously create adults; instead, they first populate a juvenile pool that matures subsequently.
- Mathematical form:
  - New unobserved state J_t (ind m^-2).
  - Juveniles survive via survival_juv(t) = exp( -[ mJ + mJ_food * (1 - phi_food(t)) ] ).
  - A fraction p_mature of surviving juveniles mature each year.
  - Larval production (fecundity × spawning success × temperature) contributes to J_{t+1}, not directly to adults.
  - Adults update to next year as C_{t+1} = BH( C_surv + matured + immigration ), where BH is Beverton–Holt.
- Expected benefits:
  - Adds a realistic 1+ year lag from reproduction to adult abundance, improving the timing and sharpness of outbreaks.
  - Maintains parsimony: only four additional parameters with interpretable roles and bounded ranges.
  - Respects the “no data leakage” constraint by initializing juveniles with an estimated init_J and not using current-time observations in dynamics.

New/modified parameters (with suggested bounds)
- mJ (yr^-1, 0..5): baseline juvenile mortality; juveniles typically have higher mortality than adults.
- mJ_food (yr^-1, 0..5): additional juvenile mortality when food is scarce; juveniles are likely more food-limited than adults.
- p_mature (0..1): fraction of surviving juveniles maturing each year; encapsulates time to maturity and variability.
- init_J (ind m^-2, 0..5): initial juvenile density to avoid forcing from zero; improves stability at the first step.

Notes
- Immigration remains a direct adult input per its current definition and units. If later evidence indicates that immigration is pre-settlement larval supply, we can route it into the juvenile pool instead.
- If residuals later show systematic underestimation of outbreak thresholds at low adult density, we could consider a higher-order fertilization function (e.g., Hill coefficient >1) as an alternative or complementary mechanism; for now we kept the original Allee form to limit complexity.

Next steps requested
- Please provide the residuals file to validate reductions in bias/autocorrelation and to fine-tune the maturation fraction and juvenile mortality scales.
