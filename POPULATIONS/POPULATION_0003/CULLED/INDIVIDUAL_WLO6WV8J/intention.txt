Assessment:
The current model fits the observed boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks reasonably well but oversimplifies resource limitation effects. In nature, as coral cover declines the ecosystemâ€™s capacity to support high COTS densities diminishes, creating a negative feedback on exponential COTS growth. To address this, we introduce a carrying capacity mechanism by adding the parameter "cots_carrying_capacity_factor" (set to 0.1) that converts available coral cover (the sum of fast and slow-growing components) into an effective maximum COTS population. This change helps capture the ecological reality that reduced habitat can limit outbreak magnitudes and sustain realistic boom-bust cycles.
