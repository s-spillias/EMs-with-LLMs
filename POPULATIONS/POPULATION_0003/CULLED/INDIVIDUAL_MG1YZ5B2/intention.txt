1. The model simulates episodic Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Outbreaks are triggered by environmental conditions and resource limitations in coral communities.
3. It captures boom-bust cycles by predicting outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration using discrete time steps.
4. Previous time step values are used for predictions, ensuring no data leakage.
5. The model considers selective predation on coral types (fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites) and includes saturating functions, threshold effects, and smooth transitions for numerical stability.
