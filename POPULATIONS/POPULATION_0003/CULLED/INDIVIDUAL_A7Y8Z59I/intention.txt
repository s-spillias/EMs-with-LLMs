Assessment:
The current model predicts COTS outbreak dynamics by computing resource limitation using the sum of observed fast- and slow-growing coral cover from the previous time step. Although this avoids using the current time step's observations, it creates an inconsistency because the modelâ€™s coral dynamics are simulated separately. Using the observed coral cover may not accurately capture the feedback between coral state and COTS population changes.

Improvement:
Modify the resource limitation calculation to use the predicted coral cover (fast_pred and slow_pred) from the previous time step. This change improves internal consistency and more realistically represents the ecological interactions between coral communities and COTS outbreaks.
