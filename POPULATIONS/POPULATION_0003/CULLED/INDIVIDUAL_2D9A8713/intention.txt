Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model employs a single efficiency parameter ("efficiency_coral") to represent the predatory impact of COTS on coral communities. However, fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites exhibit contrasting resilience to predation. To better capture these differential responses, we have separated the predation efficiency into two distinct parameters:
- efficiency_fast: representing the lower predation impact on fast-growing coral (reflecting higher resilience).
- efficiency_slow: capturing the higher predation impact on slow-growing coral.

This change is ecologically justified to enhance the modelâ€™s capability in simulating the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks via more realistic selective predation dynamics.
