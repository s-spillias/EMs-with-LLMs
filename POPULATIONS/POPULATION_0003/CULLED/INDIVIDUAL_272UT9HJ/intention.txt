Goal: Predict episodic boom–bust outbreaks of adult Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef while jointly tracking fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae, Porites) coral cover. The model operates annually and is designed for forecasting under environmental forcing (SST) and exogenous larval immigration.

Ecological functioning:
- Food-limited outbreaks: Adult COTS consume coral, strongly preferring fast-growing Acropora. Consumption follows a saturating (smooth) functional response that cannot remove more coral than is available. Coral consumption fuels COTS recruitment via a process-specific conversion efficiency.
- Environmental modulation: Sea-surface temperature (SST) modifies larval-to-juvenile survival and fecundity via a smooth thermal performance curve (Gaussian around an optimum). Elevated SST increases bleaching-driven coral mortality through a smooth logistic response rather than hard thresholds.
- Demographic feedbacks: Adult COTS suffer background and density-dependent mortality (Beverton–Holt form for stability), while reproduction is limited at low densities by a smooth Allee effect reflecting broadcast spawning. Immigration pulses add to recruitment and can trigger outbreaks.
- Coral community feedbacks: Corals grow logistically with total-cover crowding. COTS impose selective predation (stronger on Acropora), causing rapid declines during outbreaks, followed by recovery phases once COTS crash. Depleted coral reduces future COTS recruitment, producing characteristic boom–bust cycles.
- Numerical robustness: All transitions are smooth, use small constants to avoid division by zero, and enforce biologically plausible parameter ranges via soft penalties (not hard bounds). Observations are always included in likelihoods with minimum error floors.

Outputs:
- Yearly predictions for cots_pred (ind/m2), fast_pred (%) and slow_pred (%) with sst_pred and cotsimm_pred reported as inputs. Likelihoods use lognormal (COTS) and logit-normal (coral %) observation models. Initial states are anchored to the first observed values to avoid data leakage.
