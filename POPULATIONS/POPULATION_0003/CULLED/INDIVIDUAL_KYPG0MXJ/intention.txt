Comprehensive Model Revision Intention:

Assessment:
- The current model reproduces the observed boom-bust cycles in COTS outbreaks by incorporating resource limitation, coral dynamics, and a temperature modifier.
- Residual analysis indicates that while the model captures the general pattern, there is residual curvature with respect to temperature that a strictly linear effect may not fully capture.

Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce a quadratic temperature term to allow for non-linear responses of outbreak dynamics to sea surface temperature.
- Ecologically, this reflects that extreme temperature changes may disproportionately impact outbreak escalation rather than moderate shifts.
- The new parameter "quad_effect_sst" will work alongside the existing linear term to better model the temperature effects without using current time step observed values (all effects use t-1 data).

Implementation:
- A new parameter "quad_effect_sst" is added in parameters.json.
- In model.cpp, the outbreak dynamics are updated so that temperature_factor = 1 + effect_sst * sst_dat(t-1) + quad_effect_sst * sst_dat(t-1)^2.
