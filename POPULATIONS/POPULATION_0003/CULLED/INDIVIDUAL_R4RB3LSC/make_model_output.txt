You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

Below are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for modifying POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0003/INDIVIDUAL_R4RB3LSC/model.cpp to replace the undeclared dlnorm functions with an equivalent formulation using dnorm. This version computes the log-likelihood for a lognormal distribution by transforming to a normal density on the logarithmic scale and subtracting the log-transformation

Below are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for modifying POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0003/INDIVIDUAL_R4RB3LSC/model.cpp so that it reads the "Year" variable from the data rather than "year_dat". This should resolve the error when reading the variable.

Search results found for growth_rate_COTS
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) has an exceptional reproductive capacity and the potential for exponential population growth.

The first study, "Relationships between size and reproductive output in the crown-of-thorns starfish," notes that the crown-of-thorns starfish is "reported to have exceptional reproductive capacity" (Pratchett et al., 2017). This high reproductive potential is largely inferred from the species' biology, as they are known to produce large numbers of eggs and larvae.

The second study, "Validating effectiveness of crown-of-thorns starfish control," provides further context on the population dynamics of the crown-of-thorns starfish. It states that at an initial coral cover of 10%, most reefs across the Great Barrier Reef are expected to increase in coral cover by 2% to 4% over a year (Bozec et al., 2022). This rapid increase in coral cover is likely driven by the exponential growth of the crown-of-thorns starfish population.

The third study, "Modelling Growth of Juvenile Crown-of-Thorns Starfish on the Great Barrier Reef," directly addresses the exponential growth potential of the species. It reports that juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish exhibit exponential growth over their first year on the reef, reaching sizes of up to 52.5 mm by mid-year (Pratchett et al., 2019).

In summary, the search results indicate that the crown-of-thorns starfish has an exceptional reproductive capacity and the potential for exponential population growth, which can lead to rapid increases in coral cover on reefs. This highlights the importance of effective management and control strategies to mitigate the impacts of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks.

After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the intrinsic growth rate of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) expressed in year^-1.

While the search results discuss exponential growth potential and reproductive capacity, they do not provide a precise numerical growth rate. The text mentions:
- "Exceptional reproductive capacity"
- "Exponential population growth"
- "Juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish exhibit exponential growth over their first year"

However, these are qualitative descriptions without a quantitative growth rate value.

Attempt 3 for mortality_rate_COTS: Natural death rate influencing Crown of Thorns starfish population dynamics
Search results found for mortality_rate_COTS
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the natural death rate appears to be an important factor influencing the population dynamics of the Crown of Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci).

The first study found that small juvenile Crown of Thorns starfish (3 mm in diameter) suffered mortality rates of 2.6% per day, with 73% of this mortality attributed to mobile predators (Morley et al., 2018). This suggests that predation is a significant source of natural mortality for young Crown of Thorns starfish.

The second study incorporated a new zone-specific mortality rate to account for differences in predation of Crown of Thorns starfish in their model projections (Hock et al., 2022). This indicates that incorporating accurate mortality rates, including natural mortality from predation, is important for understanding and predicting Crown of Thorns starfish population dynamics.

The third study did not directly address natural mortality rates, but it did note that the size-frequency distribution of Crown of Thorns starfish can be influenced by extrinsic factors, such as diet and competition (Pratchett et al., 2023). These factors can also contribute to natural mortality and influence population dynamics.

In summary, the search results suggest that natural mortality, particularly from predation, is an important factor influencing the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish. Accurately accounting for natural mortality rates, including differences in predation across different zones, is crucial for understanding and modeling the population dynamics of this ecologically important species.

Asking claude
Based on the search results provided, there are no direct numerical values for the annual natural mortality rate of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS).

The only mortality-related data point is a daily mortality rate of 2.6% for small juvenile COTS, which would translate to an annual rate. Converting this to an annual rate:

Daily rate: 2.6% = 0.026
Annual rate: 0.026 * 365 = 9.49 year^-1

However, this is specifically for small juveniles and may not represent the overall population's natural mortality rate.

Given the limited and context-specific nature of the mortality data, the most appropriate response is:

No relevant values found

The search results suggest mortality is complex and varies by size, zone, and predation, but do not provide a clear, generalizable annual natural mortality rate for the entire COTS population.

Search results found for coral_growth_fast
**************************************************

Based on the search results, Acropora coral species have the potential for rapid regeneration and recovery after physical damage or disturbance events:

The capacity for Acropora corals to regenerate after physical damage contributes to their ability to persist in dynamic and competitive reef environments (Shedrawi et al., 2021). Studies have shown that Acropora millepora coral recruits can undergo rapid regeneration, with recovery taking as little as 192 days on average in some sheltered sites (Shedrawi et al., 2021).

Furthermore, Acropora corals have demonstrated the ability to rapidly recover from mass bleaching events. A study in the Great Barrier Reef found that Acropora coral communities were able to recover within 4 years after a severe bleaching event, with spawning rates increasing significantly from 40.6% in 2017 to 90.0% in 2019 (Clements et al., 2022).

These findings highlight the remarkable regenerative capacity and recovery potential of Acropora coral species, which can help them withstand and bounce back from various disturbances in their environment. The rapid regeneration and recovery of Acropora corals contribute to the overall resilience and persistence of coral reef ecosystems.

Search results found for coral_growth_slow
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the key points regarding the conservative growth characteristics of Faviidae and Porites coral species are:

1. Porites is considered a prime example of the "coral species problem" due to its extreme taxonomic confusion (Brakel, 1977). This suggests that Porites species exhibit high variability and complexity in their growth characteristics.

2. Massive Porites colonies develop a bumpy growth surface as they increase in size. This bumpy growth surface develops as the skeletal growth becomes uneven over time (Lough & Barnes, 2000).

3. Compared to other coral genera like Favia, Favites, and Pocillopora, Porites species tend to exhibit more conservative, slower growth patterns (Pratchett et al., 2015). Sites with low coral recovery were found to have higher numbers of Porites recruits but lower survivorship, indicating that larval supply is not the limiting factor for Porites growth in these areas.

In summary, the Porites coral genus is known for its taxonomic complexity and variable growth characteristics, with massive Porites colonies developing a bumpy growth surface over time. Compared to other coral genera, Porites species generally exhibit more conservative, slower growth patterns, with recruitment and survivorship being the key factors limiting their growth in some areas.
