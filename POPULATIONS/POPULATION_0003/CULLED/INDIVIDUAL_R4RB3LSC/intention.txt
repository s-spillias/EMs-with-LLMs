Template Model Builder Model for Episodic Outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish on the Great Barrier Reef

This model simulates boom-bust cycles where COTS rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline.
It incorporates multiple forms of resource limitation (via saturating functions and smooth threshold effects),
environmental modifiers, and indirect feedback loops between COTS and coral communities (fast-growing Acropora,
slow-growing Faviidae and Porites). Outbreak triggering mechanisms include changes in intrinsic growth, environmental thresholds,
and selective predation effects. The model structure avoids data leakage by using only past time step values,
ensuring robust predictions of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
