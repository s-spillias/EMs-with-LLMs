Assessment and Revision:
1. The current model successfully replicates boom-bust cycles but lacks an explicit environmental driver to modulate outbreak triggering. 
2. Field data suggest that sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies can significantly enhance COTS outbreak dynamics.
3. We introduce a new parameter `optimum_sst` that represents the optimal SST for outbreak initiation.
4. In the model, the intrinsic growth rate is modified by an environmental factor computed as exp(effect_sst * (sst_dat(t-1) - optimum_sst)).
5. This modification captures non-linear responses to SST and, by using only previous time step observations, avoids data leakage.
