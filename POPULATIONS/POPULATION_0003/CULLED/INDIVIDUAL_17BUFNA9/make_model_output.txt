Below are the changes that implement our improvement. We are adding an environmental driver to modify the intrinsic outbreak growth rate by incorporating a nonlinear effect of sea surface temperature (SST). This improvement is justified ecologically because many studies indicate that SST anomalies trigger or intensify COTS outbreaks. In this update, we introduce a new     
parameter optimum_sst (with a default value of 27.0 °C) that represents the optimal temperature for outbreak triggering. In the outbreak dynamics, we compute an environmental factor as                                                                                                                                                                                               
  exp(effect_sst * (sst_dat(t-1) - optimum_sst))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
and use it to multiplicatively affect the growth term. This ensures that only previous time step values are used for predictions and that the SST’s influence is modeled nonlinearly.

 1. The current model successfully replicates boom-bust cycles but lacks an explicit environmental driver to modulate outbreak triggering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 2. Field data suggest that sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies can significantly enhance COTS outbreak dynamics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 3. We introduce a new parameter `optimum_sst` that represents the optimal SST for outbreak initiation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 4. In the model, the intrinsic growth rate is modified by an environmental factor computed as exp(effect_sst * (sst_dat(t-1) - optimum_sst)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 5. This modification captures non-linear responses to SST and, by using only previous time step observations, avoids data leakage.
