Below is the plan for one ecological improvement. We assessed that although the model reasonably captures the boom‐bust dynamics with a logistic outbreak trigger, its symmetric (linear in the exponent) response may be too simplistic given that outbreak triggering often has a non‐linear (asymmetric) response to resource limitation. To improve this, we add a quadratic       
(second‐order) term in the exponent so that small deviations below the threshold do little, whereas deviations above the threshold trigger a rapid outbreak. This is ecologically justified as coral resource availability may have a threshold effect that accelerates outbreak dynamics. We introduce a new parameter log_outbreak_curve (added to parameters.json and declared in   
model.cpp) that controls the strength of this quadratic effect.

 Assessment: The current model captures basic boom-bust dynamics using a logistic outbreak trigger based on resource limitation. However, this triggering mechanism assumes a symmetric response to deviations from the outbreak threshold, which may not fully capture the rapid onset observed in ecological data. To address this, we now introduce a quadratic term in the outbrea 
 trigger exponent. This enhancement allows for a steeper, non-linear increase in outbreak probability as resource limitation exceeds the threshold. A new parameter "log_outbreak_curve" is added to control the strength of this non-linearity. All predictions continue to use only previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
