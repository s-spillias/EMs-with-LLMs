Assessment: The current model captures basic boom-bust dynamics using a logistic outbreak trigger based on resource limitation. However, this triggering mechanism assumes a symmetric response to deviations from the outbreak threshold, which may not fully capture the rapid onset observed in ecological data. To address this, we now introduce a quadratic term in the outbreak trigger exponent. This enhancement allows for a steeper, non-linear increase in outbreak probability as resource limitation exceeds the threshold. A new parameter "log_outbreak_curve" is added to control the strength of this non-linearity. All predictions continue to use only previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
