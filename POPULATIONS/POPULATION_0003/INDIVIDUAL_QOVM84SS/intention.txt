Assessment summary (structural and qualitative; residuals file not provided)

1) Fit to data (qualitative, pending residuals)
- Without access to the residuals, a quantitative evaluation is not possible. Structurally, the model is capable of reproducing smooth dynamics with boom–bust tendencies via (a) prey-dependent COTS survival, (b) saturating recruitment, and (c) density dependence (Beverton–Holt).
- Likely issues commonly seen in similar setups:
  - Underprediction of rapid outbreak onsets if recruitment is too weakly coupled to favorable conditions that precede outbreaks.
  - Overprediction of sustained high COTS densities after peak if recruitment/survival do not drop fast enough when coral declines.
  - Timing mismatches if the model lacks strong positive feedbacks linking prey recovery to reproduction.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths: Selective predation with saturating functional responses and a flexible exponent q; temperature modifiers for larvae and corals; food-limited COTS survival; immigration; density dependence. These are core elements for COTS–coral dynamics and can produce oscillatory behavior.
- Gaps for episodic outbreaks: Recruitment depends only on adult density and temperature. It does not respond to prey (coral) availability via adult condition or early life-stage viability, which is a key positive feedback for generating sharp outbreaks. Additionally, common external drivers (riverine nutrient pulses, plankton blooms) are not explicitly represented as data-driven modifiers here.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Adult condition affecting fecundity/larval survival (missing): No explicit coupling between coral availability and reproductive output/settlement success.
- Stage structure (oversimplified): Juveniles (cryptic) are not represented; this can add lag/overshoot mechanics.
- External environmental pulses (missing as a driver): No explicit runoff/chl-a proxy aside from SST and immigration.
- Disturbance-driven coral losses (oversimplified): Only background mortality and predation; severe disturbance or bleaching pulses are not explicit.

Chosen improvement: Food-conditioned fecundity (variable efficiency term)

Ecological reasoning
- Adult condition and early life-stage survival are higher when prey (live coral) is abundant. This induces a positive feedback: when coral recovers between outbreaks, COTS reproduction becomes more effective, enabling a rapid rise to outbreak levels. As COTS deplete coral, this reproductive efficiency falls, supporting the bust phase.
- This mechanism is a parsimonious way to capture outbreak timing and magnitude without adding new data inputs or full stage structure.

Mathematical form (implemented)
- Let phi_food(t) = (A_t + S_t) / (foodK + A_t + S_t), as already defined for survival.
- Introduce alpha_fec_food ∈ [0, 1] to scale fecundity by food availability:
  fec_eff(t) = fec * [1 - alpha_fec_food * (1 - phi_food(t))]
- Replace recruits(t):
  recruits(t) = fec_eff(t) * C_t * phi_spawn(t) * phi_T_COTS(t)
- Edge cases:
  - If phi_food ≈ 1 (high live coral), fec_eff ≈ fec (full fecundity).
  - If phi_food ≈ 0 (no live coral), fec_eff ≈ fec * (1 - alpha_fec_food); alpha_fec_food = 1 implies no effective recruitment under food collapse.

Expected effects on dynamics and residuals
- Faster outbreak onset when coral recovers (residuals before peaks should reduce).
- Sharper decline post-peak as coral is consumed, lowering recruitment (residuals after peaks should reduce).
- Improved duration control of outbreak plateaus via feedback rather than only via Beverton–Holt crowding.

Parameterization and bounds
- New parameter alpha_fec_food (dimensionless), lower_bound = 0.0, upper_bound = 1.0.
- Interpretation: Fractional strength of food control on effective fecundity. 0 = no effect (reverts to original model); 1 = fecundity fully tracks food index phi_food.
- Smooth bound penalty added to maintain ecological plausibility.

Notes and next steps (pending residuals)
- If residuals show systematic timing lags, consider adding a simple juvenile stage (1-year delay).
- If residuals show outbreak magnitudes tied to external events, consider adding a runoff/chl-a proxy driving fecundity or early survival.
- If residuals show biases by coral group, consider dynamic preference (availability-dependent wA) or group-specific temperature sensitivities.

Data integrity
- No data leakage introduced. Only predicted state at time t influences time t+1; observational series are only used at t = 0 for initialization.
