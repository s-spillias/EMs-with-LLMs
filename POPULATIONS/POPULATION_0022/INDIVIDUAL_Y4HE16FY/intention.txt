**Assessment of the current model:**
The model provides a solid foundation, linking COTS population dynamics to coral cover through a predator-prey relationship. It includes key processes like density-dependent COTS mortality (starvation), larval immigration, and predation preference. However, the local COTS recruitment function, a standard Beverton-Holt model, is a point of oversimplification. This model assumes maximum per-capita reproductive success at the lowest densities, which is often not true for broadcast spawning organisms like COTS that can suffer from low fertilization success when mates are scarce (an Allee effect). This simplification may prevent the model from accurately capturing the long periods of low abundance and the sharp, threshold-like triggers of population outbreaks that characterize COTS boom-bust cycles.

**Chosen Ecological Improvement:**
I will introduce a component Allee effect into the COTS local recruitment function. This modifies the existing Beverton-Holt recruitment model to account for reduced reproductive success at low population densities.

**Reasoning and Implementation:**
The Allee effect provides a critical ecological mechanism for triggering population outbreaks. By adding a density threshold below which reproduction is inefficient, the model can better represent a system where the COTS population remains suppressed until it is pushed above this threshold, for instance by a pulse of larval immigration (`cotsimm_dat`). This creates a more realistic "switch" that can initiate a boom phase.

This will be implemented by:
1.  Adding a new parameter, `cots_allee`, to `parameters.json`. This parameter represents the COTS density at which the Allee effect reduces reproductive success to 50% of its potential.
2.  Modifying the `model.cpp` file to declare `cots_allee` as a parameter.
3.  Updating the COTS recruitment calculation within the model's time-stepping loop. The existing Beverton-Holt recruitment term will be multiplied by a sigmoid function `cots_pred(t-1) / (cots_allee + cots_pred(t-1))`, which represents the Allee effect's impact on reproductive success.

This change directly addresses the project's goal of modeling the triggers of episodic outbreaks by introducing a non-linear feedback mechanism that is well-documented for similar species.
