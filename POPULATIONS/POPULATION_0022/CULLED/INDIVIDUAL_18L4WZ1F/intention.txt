This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities, aiming to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles observed on the Great Barrier Reef.

The model's core components are:
1. COTS Population: COTS dynamics are driven by two main processes. Population increases are primarily fueled by external larval immigration, representing a key trigger for outbreaks. Population declines are governed by a natural background mortality rate and a density-dependent starvation effect, which intensifies as the available coral food source is depleted.

2. Coral Communities: The model distinguishes between fast-growing (e.g., Acropora) and slow-growing (e.g., Faviidae, Porites) corals. Both types compete for space and exhibit logistic growth. Their growth rates are modulated by sea-surface temperature, with an optimal temperature range for maximal growth.

3. Predator-Prey Interaction: COTS prey on both coral types. This interaction is modeled using a multi-species functional response that incorporates predator satiation and a preference for the more palatable fast-growing corals. This selective predation links the COTS and coral dynamics.

The model captures the critical feedback loop where a COTS outbreak, initiated by larval influx, decimates coral cover. The subsequent food scarcity leads to COTS starvation and a population crash, which then allows for the potential recovery of the coral communities.
