Model Assessment:
The current model's ability to simulate COTS outbreaks is critically limited because it relies entirely on an external forcing variable (`cotsimm_dat`) for population increases. It cannot endogenously trigger or amplify outbreaks, which is a core requirement of the project. The "boom" phase of the boom-bust cycle is prescribed, not predicted. The "bust" phase, driven by starvation-induced mortality, is well-represented.

Proposed Improvement:
I will introduce endogenous COTS reproduction using a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment model. This will allow the COTS population to grow based on its own density, creating a positive feedback loop essential for modeling outbreak dynamics.

Reasoning:
This change directly addresses the model's primary shortcoming. The equation `recruits = (a * adults) / (1 + b * adults)` adds local reproduction that saturates at high densities, representing limitations on larval survival or settlement space. This allows the model to generate its own "boom" cycles based on the reef's state (adult COTS density), rather than relying on an external immigration schedule. The existing immigration term (`cotsimm_dat`) is retained, representing larval supply from other reefs, which can act as a trigger for the local reproductive feedback loop. This provides a more realistic mechanism for both triggering and sustaining outbreaks. Two new parameters, `cots_repro_a` and `cots_repro_b`, will be introduced to control the shape of this recruitment curve.
