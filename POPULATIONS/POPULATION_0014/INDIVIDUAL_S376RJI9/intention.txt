Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation, capturing the essential predator-prey dynamics between COTS and two coral groups, as well as inter-specific competition between the corals. It uses standard ecological formulations like Holling Type II for predation and logistic growth for corals.

However, its primary weakness, in the context of modeling episodic outbreaks, is the mechanism for triggering these events. The model relies entirely on an exogenous data input, `cotsimm_dat`, to represent larval supply and initiate outbreaks. This means the model cannot explain *why* an outbreak starts; it can only simulate the consequences of an externally forced one. This is a major simplification, as a key goal is to understand the processes that trigger and sustain outbreaks. The presence of an unused `sst_dat` vector indicates a clear opportunity to incorporate environmental drivers.

Proposed Ecological Improvement:
To address this, I will introduce a temperature-dependent mechanism for COTS larval success, directly linking environmental conditions to outbreak potential. This is a critical step towards modeling the boom-bust cycle more mechanistically.

1.  **Ecological Rationale:** The survival and settlement of COTS larvae are known to be strongly influenced by sea surface temperature (SST). Larval success is typically highest within an optimal thermal range. By making the larval immigration term sensitive to SST, the model can simulate how favorable temperature conditions can lead to massive recruitment events, thus triggering an outbreak.

2.  **Mathematical Implementation:** I will modulate the incoming larval supply (`cotsimm_dat`) using a Gaussian function of SST. The effective immigration at each time step will be:
    `effective_immigration = cotsimm_dat * exp(-0.5 * ((SST - sst_opt) / sst_tol)^2)`

    This formulation introduces two new, ecologically meaningful parameters:
    - `sst_opt`: The optimal sea surface temperature (in Celsius) that maximizes larval success.
    - `sst_tol`: The thermal tolerance (in Celsius), representing the standard deviation of the optimal temperature range. A smaller value indicates a narrower thermal niche.

3.  **Expected Outcome:** This change will allow the model to generate outbreak dynamics that are coupled with the observed temperature time series. It will test the hypothesis that temperature anomalies contribute to the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks, fulfilling a core requirement of the project. This moves the model from a purely descriptive one to a more predictive and explanatory tool.
