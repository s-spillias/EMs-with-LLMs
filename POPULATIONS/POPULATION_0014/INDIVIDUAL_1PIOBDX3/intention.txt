Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid framework for COTS-coral dynamics, incorporating temperature-driven larval immigration as an outbreak trigger, selective predation on different coral types, and density-dependent COTS mortality. The structure correctly links the COTS population to its food source (coral cover) through a Holling Type II functional response.

Identified Gap:
A key missing process is an explicit starvation mechanism for COTS. The current model relies on a high, constant natural mortality rate (`m_c`). While this will cause a population decline when food limitation reduces the growth rate, it does not model an active increase in mortality due to starvation. This is a critical feedback for producing the rapid population crashes ("busts") observed in nature after a reef's coral has been depleted.

Proposed Improvement:
To better capture the characteristic "boom-bust" cycle of COTS outbreaks, I will introduce a dynamic, starvation-induced mortality term. This term will increase the COTS mortality rate as available coral food becomes scarce.

Implementation Details:
The COTS mortality equation will be modified to include a new component that activates when food levels are low. The new equation will be:
`cots_mortality = m_c + m_c_den * cots_pred(t-1) + m_s * (1.0 - tanh(available_food / K_m))`

This introduces two new parameters:
1. `m_s`: The maximum additional mortality rate from starvation.
2. `K_m`: The coral cover threshold below which starvation effects become significant.

The hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) function ensures a smooth but rapid transition from low to high starvation mortality, which is ecologically realistic and numerically stable for model fitting. This change directly strengthens the feedback between resource depletion and predator population collapse.
