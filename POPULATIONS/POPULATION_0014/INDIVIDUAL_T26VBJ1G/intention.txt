Model Assessment and Improvement:
1. The current model reasonably captures the boom‐bust cycles of COTS but oversimplifies the predation on corals via a directly proportional consumption term.
2. Considering the ecological dynamics of coral predation, we propose using a saturating (Michaelis–Menten) functional response. This approach reflects that even at high coral cover, the consumption rate is limited by predator handling time or resource accessibility.
3. Added parameters "half_saturation_fast" and "half_saturation_slow" introduce thresholds for fast and slow-growing coral consumption, respectively.
