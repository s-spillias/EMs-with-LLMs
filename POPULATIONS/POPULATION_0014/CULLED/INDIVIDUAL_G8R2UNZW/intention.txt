Assessment:
-----------
The current model captures many key dynamics of COTS outbreaks including predation saturation and coral-boost effects. However, it oversimplifies the population dynamics by not considering that at low population densities, COTS growth can be inhibited—a phenomenon known as the Allee effect. Incorporating an Allee effect allows the model to better reproduce the observed boom-bust cycles by introducing a density-dependent threshold below which reproduction is less effective. This is ecologically justified by the idea that below a threshold density, factors like mate finding and collective defense are impaired.
Chosen Improvement:
-------------------
Introduce an Allee effect by adding a new parameter “allee_threshold”. The logistic growth term is modified so that growth is scaled by ((cots_prev - allee_threshold)/(carrying_capacity - allee_threshold)), ensuring that if COTS density is below the threshold, growth is suppressed.
