Assessment and Reasoning:
--------------------------
The current model captures logistic COTS growth and coral consumption dynamics; however, the residuals indicate that the rapid acceleration during outbreak phases is underrepresented. We propose adding an ecological feedback where abundant coral (both fast and slow growing) provides additional nutritional resources that boost COTS reproduction. This “coral boost” term is intended to better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of the observed outbreak boom‐bust cycles. The term is incorporated using only previous time-step values to avoid data leakage.
