Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation for simulating Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) dynamics. It incorporates key processes such as a Holling Type II functional response for predation, selective feeding on different coral types, logistic growth for corals with interspecific competition, and density-dependent mortality for COTS. This structure is capable of producing the boom-bust cycles mentioned in the project context, where COTS outbreaks are driven by coral availability and eventually limited by resource depletion and density-dependent effects.

Identified Weakness:
While the model includes food limitation through its effect on COTS growth (via the `food_intake` term), the mortality component is less responsive to resource availability. The current COTS mortality is a sum of a constant natural rate (`m_c`) and a linear density-dependent term (`m_c_den * cots_pred`). This may not adequately capture the rapid population crashes that occur when COTS completely decimate their coral food source, leading to widespread starvation. The "bust" phase of the cycle could be more pronounced and more tightly coupled to the state of the coral community.

Proposed Ecological Improvement:
To better capture the full boom-bust cycle, especially the rapid decline phase, I will introduce a starvation-induced mortality term for the COTS population. This change directly addresses the need to model mechanisms that both sustain and terminate outbreaks.

Ecological Rationale:
The proposed mechanism adds a mortality component that is inversely proportional to the total coral cover from the previous time step.
- When coral cover is abundant, this additional mortality is negligible, and COTS population dynamics are governed by the existing growth and mortality terms.
- As the COTS population grows and consumes coral, the declining coral cover causes the starvation mortality term to increase exponentially.
- This creates a strong, non-linear negative feedback, triggering a rapid COTS population crash once the food resource is depleted below a critical level.
This modification enhances the model's ecological realism by explicitly linking COTS survival to the availability of its food source, a critical factor in the observed dynamics of COTS outbreaks.

Implementation Details:
1.  **parameters.json**: A new parameter, `m_c_starv`, will be introduced. This parameter represents the coefficient for starvation-induced mortality, scaling the effect of low coral cover on the COTS death rate.
2.  **model.cpp**: The COTS mortality equation will be updated to include the new term: `cots_mortality = m_c + m_c_den * cots_pred(t-1) + m_c_starv / (fast_pred(t-1) + slow_pred(t-1) + 1e-8)`. This makes the total mortality rate dependent on natural causes, density, and food availability (starvation).
