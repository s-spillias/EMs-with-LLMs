Assessment and Updated Model Intentions:
1. The current model captures logistic growth modulated by outbreak transitions and saturating coral dynamics.
2. However, it lacks a feedback mechanism from coral habitat degradation. In severe outbreaks, the loss of coral (both fast- and slow-growing) can limit the long‚Äêterm capacity for COTS expansion.
3. To address this, we introduce a habitat feedback mechanism: if the average coral cover (fast + slow) falls below a specified threshold (coral_threshold), the effective growth rate of COTS is reduced by a factor determined by habitat_loss_effect.
4. This improvement integrates a resource limitation mechanism, enhancing the model's ability to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
