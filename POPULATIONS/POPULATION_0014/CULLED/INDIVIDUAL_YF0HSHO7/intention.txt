Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model utilizes logistic growth modulated by predation and saturating functions for coral consumption. Although it captures basic boom‐bust dynamics, the model underestimates the rapidity and magnitude of outbreak growth phases seen in real-world COTS events.
To better represent episodic outbreaks:
• We introduce a threshold-based, nonlinear outbreak amplification mechanism.
• When the previous COTS population exceeds a specified threshold (outbreak_threshold), the logistic growth component is amplified by a growth_outbreak_amplifier.
This added mechanism accounts for potential positive feedbacks (e.g., behavioral or environmental triggers) that can accelerate outbreaks, thereby more faithfully simulating the characteristic outbreak trajectories.
