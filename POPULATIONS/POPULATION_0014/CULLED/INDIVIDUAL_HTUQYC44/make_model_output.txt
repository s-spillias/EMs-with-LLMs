Below is my plan and reasoning:                                                                                                                                                                                        

Assessment and chosen improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                     
After evaluating the model and considering the project context, I find that although the current logistic growth and predation dynamics capture a degree of complexity, they do not fully mimic the boom‐bust dynamics 
of COTS outbreaks. In particular, the model does not include a feedback that kicks in when COTS populations exceed a critical threshold. Ecologically, when starfish numbers surpass a threshold, additional           
density‐dependent mortality (e.g., via resource limitation or feedback mechanisms) may dampen further growth, triggering a natural “crash” after an outbreak. We choose to add a threshold-dependent extra mortality to
the COTS dynamics. This term (activated only when the population exceeds the threshold) should help capture the episodic explosive growth followed by rapid declines and hence improve the model’s ecological realism.

 2 In parameters.json, add two new parameters: outbreak_threshold and outbreak_mortality with ecological justifications.                                                                                               
 3 In model.cpp, add the new parameters (i.e. declaration via PARAMETER) and update the COTS dynamics equation to subtract an extra mortality term when the previous time step’s COTS population exceeds the outbreak  
   threshold.

 Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:                                                                                                                                                                                 
 The previous model used logistic growth and fixed predation to simulate COTS dynamics, which does not fully capture episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish observed in the field.                             
 To improve realism, we introduce a threshold-dependent density regulation mechanism:                                                                                                                                  
 - When the COTS population exceeds a critical threshold (outbreak_threshold), an additional density-dependent mortality (outbreak_mortality) is applied.                                                              
 This mechanism represents ecological feedbacks such as resource limitations or intra-population pressure that contribute to the rapid crash following an outbreak.
