Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
The previous model used logistic growth and fixed predation to simulate COTS dynamics, which does not fully capture episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish observed in the field.
To improve realism, we introduce a threshold-dependent density regulation mechanism:
- When the COTS population exceeds a critical threshold (outbreak_threshold), an additional density-dependent mortality (outbreak_mortality) is applied.
This mechanism represents ecological feedbacks such as resource limitations or intra-population pressure that contribute to the rapid crash following an outbreak.
