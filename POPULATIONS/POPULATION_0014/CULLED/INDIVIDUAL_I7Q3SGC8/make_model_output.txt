Below is our proposed update. We incorporate an ecological improvement by replacing the original linear coral boost effect with a non-linear saturating boost effect. This change is motivated by the need to better   
capture the mechanism by which available coral (a key resource) enhances COTS growth only up to a point—increasing coral availability boosts growth at low-to-moderate levels but saturates at higher levels, improving
our ability to capture the timing and magnitude of outbreaks. We add a new parameter, boost_half_saturation, to represent the half‐saturation constant for this effect. Our modifications also update the model’s      
intention file to document this reasoning.

 This update addresses an observed discrepancy in the model’s ability to capture episodic COTS outbreaks. While the original model applied a linear coral boost, our analysis of residuals suggested that the positive 
 feedback from coral availability on COTS growth saturates at high coral cover levels. The new non-linear (saturating) formulation—parameterised by boost_half_saturation—accounts for resource limitation effects tha 
 modulate the coral boost. This improvement is designed to better predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of the outbreak events, while maintaining the integrity of the model by using only previous time step    
 predictions.

Below are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to add the missing parameter declaration (boost_half_saturation) to the model. This change ensures that the new parameter is properly declared in the model before being used in   
the coral boost calculation.
