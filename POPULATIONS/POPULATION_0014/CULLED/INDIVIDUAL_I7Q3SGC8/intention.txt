This update addresses an observed discrepancy in the model’s ability to capture episodic COTS outbreaks. While the original model applied a linear coral boost, our analysis of residuals suggested that the positive feedback from coral availability on COTS growth saturates at high coral cover levels. The new non-linear (saturating) formulation—parameterised by boost_half_saturation—accounts for resource limitation effects that modulate the coral boost. This improvement is designed to better predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of the outbreak events, while maintaining the integrity of the model by using only previous time step predictions.
