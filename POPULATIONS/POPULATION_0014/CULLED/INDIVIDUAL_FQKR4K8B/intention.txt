This model captures the dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish outbreaks and their impact on coral communities. The current model uses an abrupt step function to amplify growth when COTS exceed a threshold, which may oversimplify the ecological process. To better represent the gradual transition into an outbreak state, a logistic-based multiplier has been introduced. This new formulation smooths the transition, reflecting a more realistic outbreak onset and sustainability as observed in the boom-bust cycles.
