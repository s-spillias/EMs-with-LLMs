You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

 Model Summary:                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 1. This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.                                                                                                              
 2. It captures boom-bust cycles where COTS rapidly increase to outbreak levels before declining.

Below are the proposed changes to fix the conflict with the system-defined "time" function. We will rename the data vector from "time" to "years" and update its references accordingly. This should resolve the       
compilation errors.

Below are two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0014/INDIVIDUAL_W3YWBHAW/model.cpp that remove the global DATA and PARAMETER declarations and move them inside the TMB objective function. This change  
is needed because TMB macros must be invoked from within the template operator function for proper type resolution.                                                                                                    

Please review and apply these changes.

Did you mean to match some of these actual lines from POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0014/INDIVIDUAL_W3YWBHAW/model.cpp?

```
{
  // 1. Data declarations:
  //    years: time steps (years) from the data file.
  //    cots_dat: observed COTS abundance (ind/m^2).
  //    fast_dat: observed fast-growing coral cover (%).
  //    slow_dat: observed slow-growing coral cover (%).
  DATA_VECTOR(years);
  DATA_VECTOR(cots_dat);
  DATA_VECTOR(fast_dat);
  DATA_VECTOR(slow_dat);

  // 2. Parameter declarations with their biological meanings:
  //    growth_rate: intrinsic COTS growth rate (year^-1).
  //    outbreak_trigger: COTS threshold triggering outbreak conditions (ind/m^2).
  //    outbreak_efficiency: multiplier for COTS growth during outbreaks (dimensionless).

Search results found for growth_rate
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) has an exceptional reproductive capacity that increases exponentially with its size.

The first study, "Relationships between size and reproductive output in the crown-of-thorns starfish", notes that the reproductive capacity of crown-of-thorns starfish has been "largely inferred" based on their exceptional reproductive potential (Pratchett et al., 2014). This suggests that the exponential relationship between size and reproductive output is a well-established characteristic of this species.

The second study, "Validating effectiveness of crown-of-thorns starfish control", provides further context on the rapid growth potential of crown-of-thorns starfish populations. It states that at an initial coral cover of 10%, most reefs across the Great Barrier Reef are expected to increase by 2% to 4% over a year (Bozec et al., 2022). This rapid growth rate is likely driven by the exponential reproductive capacity of the starfish.

The third study, "Increasing densities of Pacific crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.)", directly states that "reproductive capacity increases exponentially with diameter, particularly in larger individuals" (Pratchett et al., 2023). This provides a clear and direct confirmation of the exponential reproductive potential of crown-of-thorns starfish.

In summary, the search results indicate that the crown-of-thorns starfish has an exceptional and exponentially increasing reproductive capacity, which is a key factor in the rapid growth of their populations. This information is supported by multiple scientific studies, as cited above.

**************************************************
Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the intrinsic growth rate of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) in year^-1 units.

While the search results discuss the exponential reproductive potential and rapid population growth of COTS, they do not provide a precise numerical intrinsic growth rate. The text describes the reproductive capacity as "exponentially increasing" and notes population dynamics, but does not quantify the specific growth rate.

Therefore, the appropriate response is:

No relevant values found

To definitively determine the intrinsic growth rate would require additional research or specialized ecological studies that directly measure population growth rates of COTS.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a major threat to coral reef ecosystems, capable of causing rapid and extensive destruction of coral cover.

The first source indicates that the crown-of-thorns starfish is "a voracious predator of coral, having been cited as the primary cause of short-term decline in coral cover" (Preparing for and managing crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks on coral reefs). This suggests that the crown-of-thorns starfish can rapidly destroy coral cover when present in outbreak conditions.

The second source provides more specific information on the rate of coral cover destruction. It states that "If cover is ≥ 40%, then the target of 0.08 CoTS.min−1 is suggested to result in an expected annual decrease in coral cover by 0% to -7%" (Validating effectiveness of crown-of-thorns starfish control). This indicates that at high coral cover levels (≥40%), the crown-of-thorns starfish can cause a 0-7% annual decrease in coral cover.

The third source further contextualizes the threat, noting that the Great Barrier Reef has experienced "4 destructive outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish since the 1960s" and that "Once established, an outbreak spreads when adult starfish spawn" (3.6.2 Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns-starfish). This highlights the recurring and potentially widespread nature of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks.

In summary, the search results indicate that the crown-of-thorns starfish is a major threat to coral reefs, capable of causing rapid and extensive destruction of coral cover, with the potential for annual decreases in coral cover of up to 7% during outbreak conditions. The threat is well-documented, with multiple destructive outbreaks recorded on the Great Barrier Reef over the past several decades.

**************************************************
Asking claude
Based on the search results, I'll extract the predation rate on fast-growing coral:

The most specific numerical value comes from the second source, which states: "0-7% annual decrease in coral cover" when the crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) density is 0.08 CoTS.min−1 at coral cover ≥ 40%.

Converting this to a predation rate per unit COTS:

{"min": 0, "max": 0.07, "value": 0.035}

Reasoning:
- The minimum value is 0%
- The maximum value is 7%
- The average (value) is 3.5%
- The units are converted to a decimal (0.035) to represent the percentage of coral loss per unit COTS

This interpretation captures the range of potential coral cover loss as described in the search results, with the caveat that the actual impact depends on specific conditions like initial coral cover and CoTS density.

**************************************************

Based on the search results provided, the gradual coral cover degradation rate caused by Crown of Thorns (COTs) starfish can be summarized as follows:

Coral reefs worldwide are experiencing severe and ongoing degradation due to various regional and global threats, including ocean warming, acidification, and predation by COTs starfish (Pratchett et al., 2014). The Great Barrier Reef, in particular, has seen a 27-year decline in coral cover, with COTs predation being one of the primary drivers of this degradation (De'ath et al., 2012).

Studies have shown that COTs can promote additional fine-grained habitat degradation across a reef or seascape, with an average rate of coral cover decline (Baird & Marshall, 2002). For example, a study by Pratchett et al. (2014) found that COTs outbreaks can lead to sequential declines in coral cover at an average rate of 3-4% per year.

It is important to note that the rate of coral cover degradation can vary depending on the specific site and the severity of the COTs outbreak. Factors such as the density of COTs, the species composition of the coral community, and the overall resilience of the reef ecosystem can all influence the rate of degradation (Pratchett et al., 2014).

In summary, the gradual coral cover degradation rate caused by COTs starfish can be significant, with an average decline of 3-4% per year in some cases, leading to severe and ongoing degradation of coral reef ecosystems worldwide (De'ath et al., 2012; Pratchett et al., 2014).

Based on the search results, I'll extract the numerical values for coral cover decline rate:

The text mentions a coral cover decline rate of 3-4% per year due to Crown of Thorns (COTs) starfish predation.

Converting this to the requested format:

{"min": 3.0, "max": 4.0, "value": 3.5}

Key observations:
- The values represent percentage of coral cover loss per year
- The range is consistently 3-4%
- The average (value) is calculated as (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5
- This represents the gradual degradation rate across reef ecosystems

Note: While the search results do not provide a direct "% loss per unit COTS", they do provide an annual degradation rate attributed to COTs starfish predation.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, there is evidence that coral ecosystems have the potential for rapid recovery and regeneration under certain conditions:

1. Coral restoration can drive rapid recovery of coral cover and reef carbonate budgets. A study published in Current Biology found that within 4 years, fast coral growth supported a recovery of coral cover from 17% to 56% and an increase in substrate rugosity (a measure of habitat complexity) (Roff et al., 2024).

2. Artificial structures can facilitate rapid coral recovery under climate change. A study published in Scientific Reports found that habitat creation on artificial structures can increase coral community resilience against climate change by increasing coral recovery rates (Ladd et al., 2025).

3. Coral recruitment and potential recovery of eutrophied and blast fishing impacted reefs is possible. The search results indicate that coral restoration can drive rapid recovery of coral communities in degraded reef ecosystems (Roff et al., 2024).

In summary, the search results suggest that coral ecosystems have significant potential for rapid recovery and regeneration, particularly when restoration efforts and the creation of artificial habitats are employed. These findings highlight the resilience of coral communities and the possibility of reversing the impacts of environmental degradation through active management and restoration strategies.

Based on the search results, I'll extract the regeneration rate for coral:

The most specific numerical value is from the Roff et al. (2024) study, which shows a coral cover increase from 17% to 56% over 4 years. 

Calculating the annual regeneration rate:
- Total increase: 39 percentage points
- Time period: 4 years
- Annual regeneration rate: 39% / 4 = 9.75% per year

Therefore, the response in the requested JSON format would be:

{"min": 9.75, "max": 9.75, "value": 9.75}

Key notes:
- This is based on a single study
- The value represents coral cover regeneration rate
- The calculation assumes linear growth
- The value is specifically for the coral ecosystem studied

The model can use this as an estimate of coral regeneration rate per year.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the key points regarding slow coral ecosystem recovery and regeneration potential are:

1. Coral and fish population recovery is fastest and most complete when the disturbance affects small coral colonies, compared to larger-scale events (Darling et al., 2019).

2. Degradation of coral reefs can inhibit the replenishment of adult coral populations due to reduced recruitment, which in turn limits the potential for reef recovery (Riegl & Purkis, 2015).

3. Coral reefs are important for oceanic ecosystems, but they are facing increasing threats of destruction from various sources. Understanding the factors that influence their recovery and regeneration potential is crucial for conservation and management efforts (SPREP, n.d.).

In summary, the recovery and regeneration potential of coral ecosystems is influenced by the scale and nature of the disturbance, as well as the degree of degradation the reef has already experienced. Smaller-scale disturbances that affect only small coral colonies tend to have the fastest and most complete recovery, while heavily degraded reefs may struggle to replenish their adult coral populations due to reduced recruitment. Addressing the threats to coral reefs and understanding the factors that influence their recovery is essential for the long-term sustainability of these important marine ecosystems.

No relevant values found

The search results do not provide a specific numerical value for the regeneration rate of slow-growing coral as a percentage per year. While the text discusses coral recovery and regeneration potential, it does not quantify the rate of regeneration with a specific percentage. To accurately determine the regeneration rate, additional research or more specific scientific sources would be needed.
