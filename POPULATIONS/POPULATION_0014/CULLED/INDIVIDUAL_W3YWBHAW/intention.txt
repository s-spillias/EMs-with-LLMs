Model Summary:
1. This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. It captures boom-bust cycles where COTS rapidly increase to outbreak levels before declining.
3. The model incorporates selective predation on coral communities, distinguishing between fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites.
4. Multiple resource limitations, environmental modifiers, and smooth transitions ensure realistic dynamics and numerical stability.
5. Likelihood calculations use lognormal error distributions to robustly match observations without data leakage.
