This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef and their selective predation on coral communities. It incorporates mechanisms including saturating resource limitations, threshold-triggered outbreak events, and feedback loops between COTS and coral dynamics. Specifically, the model captures:
1. Rapid, exponential-like COTS population increases (outbreak events) followed by bust phases.
2. Differential impacts on slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites) and fast-growing (Acropora spp.) coral covers.
3. Smooth transitions and lagged feedbacks that prevent numerical instabilities.
Environmental conditions modulate growth and predation rates, and small constants are added to ensure numerical stability.
