Assessment:
1. The current model captures basic logistic growth with an Allee effect and saturating predation. However, it underestimates the rapid escalation and subsequent bust witnessed during episodic COTS outbreaks.
2. The observed outbreak events may be driven by non-linear, density‚Äêdependent processes that amplify growth rates when COTS density exceeds certain thresholds.
3. By introducing a new parameter, "outbreak_strength", we incorporate a quadratic amplification term into the growth rate. This modification is ecologically justified as it reflects synergistic effects (e.g., reduced competition or inefficiencies in predation) that fuel explosive outbreaks.
4. This change provides a more flexible and realistic representation of outbreak dynamics.
