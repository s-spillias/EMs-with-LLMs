Assessment:
The current model captures boom‐bust dynamics in COTS populations through logistic growth with an Allee effect and saturating predation. However, it does not incorporate a key ecological feedback: during outbreaks, predator efficiency often declines due to saturation. To reflect this, the model is being enhanced with an outbreak threshold parameter and a corresponding predation efficiency modifier. When COTS density exceeds this threshold, effective predation efficiency decreases, allowing for a sharper, more realistic transition into outbreak dynamics.

Ecological Justification:
- Outbreak Threshold (outbreak_threshold): Represents the COTS density (individuals/m²) beyond which predator effectiveness is compromised.
- Outbreak Predation Modifier (outbreak_predation_modifier): Scales down the baseline predation efficiency when outbreaks occur, capturing reduced control by predators.

This improvement augments the model's ability to predict the timing and magnitude of episodic outbreaks.
