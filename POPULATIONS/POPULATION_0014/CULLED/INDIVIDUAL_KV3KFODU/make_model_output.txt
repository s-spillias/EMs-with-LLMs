Below are the planned changes with our rationale. The current model captures boom‐bust cycles using logistic growth and an Allee effect, but it does not explicitly capture a key ecological feedback: during          
outbreaks, predator efficiency can become saturated and thus reduced. This feedback can help explain the rapid explosions and subsequent collapses in COTS populations. To this end, we add two new ecological         
parameters: one to define an outbreak threshold, and a modifier to reduce predation efficiency when COTS abundance exceeds that threshold. This change will allow the model to switch to a lower effective predation   
efficiency during outbreaks, more accurately reflecting the predator saturation effects observed in the field.                                                                                                         

Below are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks that implement the following changes:                                                                                                                                              

 1 Update intention.txt with our assessment and reasoning.                                                                                                                                                             
 2 Update parameters.json to introduce outbreak_threshold and outbreak_predation_modifier.                                                                                                                             
 3 Update model.cpp to add the new parameters.                                                                                                                                                                         
 4 Update model.cpp to compute an effective predation efficiency that applies the modifier when the outbreak threshold is exceeded.                                                                                    

Please confirm, and then I can proceed with applying these changes.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 The current model captures boom‐bust dynamics in COTS populations through logistic growth with an Allee effect and saturating predation. However, it does not incorporate a key ecological feedback: during outbreaks 
 predator efficiency often declines due to saturation. To reflect this, the model is being enhanced with an outbreak threshold parameter and a corresponding predation efficiency modifier. When COTS density exceeds  
 this threshold, effective predation efficiency decreases, allowing for a sharper, more realistic transition into outbreak dynamics.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Ecological Justification:                                                                                                                                                                                             
 - Outbreak Threshold (outbreak_threshold): Represents the COTS density (individuals/m²) beyond which predator effectiveness is compromised.                                                                           
 - Outbreak Predation Modifier (outbreak_predation_modifier): Scales down the baseline predation efficiency when outbreaks occur, capturing reduced control by predators.                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 This improvement augments the model's ability to predict the timing and magnitude of episodic outbreaks.

After applying these changes, you can rebuild/run the model to see how the new variable predation efficiency affects outbreak dynamics. For example, you might run:
