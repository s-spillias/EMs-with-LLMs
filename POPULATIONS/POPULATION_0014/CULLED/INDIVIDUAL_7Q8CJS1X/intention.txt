Assessment and update:
Based on residual analysis, the current model under-predicts the magnitude of Crown of Thorns starfish outbreaks when coral cover is high, suggesting that available food (i.e. live coral cover) significantly influences outbreak sustainability. To improve ecological realism and better capture the observed boom-bust dynamics, we introduce a saturating feeding efficiency into the COTS growth equation. 

A new parameter, "half_saturation_coral", is added to represent the total coral cover (sum of fast- and slow-growing coral) at which COTS feeding efficiency reaches half its maximum. Mathematically, the effective growth rate is now scaled by:
    
    feeding_effect = (fast_pred + slow_pred) / ((fast_pred + slow_pred) + half_saturation_coral)
    
This modification ensures that when coral cover is high, the growth rate—and hence outbreak magnitude—is sufficiently enhanced, aligning with ecological observations on the Great Barrier Reef.
