Model Assessment:
The current model provides a solid foundation for COTS-coral dynamics, incorporating logistic growth for two coral types and a Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation. However, its ability to capture the full "boom-bust" cycle, a key requirement of the project, is limited. The model's primary mechanism for population decline is a linear density-dependent mortality term. This is often insufficient to produce the rapid population crashes observed in COTS outbreaks after they have decimated their coral food source. The key missing ecological process is starvation-induced mortality. The current mortality formulation is independent of food availability, which is unrealistic; a COTS population should experience significantly higher mortality when coral cover is low.

Proposed Improvement:
To better model the "bust" phase of COTS outbreaks, I will introduce a starvation-induced mortality mechanism. This change directly links COTS survival to the availability of their food source (coral), creating a strong negative feedback loop that is essential for realistic boom-bust dynamics.

Implementation Details:
1.  A new parameter, `m_s_starv`, will be introduced to represent the maximum additional mortality rate experienced by COTS under complete starvation (units: year^-1).
2.  The COTS mortality equation will be modified to include this new dynamic term. The additional mortality will be scaled based on COTS feeding satiation.
3.  Satiation is calculated as the ratio of the current food intake rate to the maximum possible food intake rate (`food_intake / a_c`). When food is abundant, satiation is high, and the starvation mortality term approaches zero. When food is scarce, satiation is low, and the starvation mortality term approaches its maximum value, `m_s_starv`.
4.  The updated COTS mortality equation will be:
    `cots_mortality = m_c (natural) + m_c_den * COTS (density-dependent) + m_s_starv * (1 - satiation) (starvation)`

This improvement will allow the model to more accurately simulate the sharp decline in COTS populations following the depletion of coral, thereby capturing the full, characteristic outbreak cycle.
