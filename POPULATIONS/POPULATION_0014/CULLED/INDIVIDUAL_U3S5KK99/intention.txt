Model Assessment:
The current model establishes a reasonable predator-prey framework between COTS and two coral types, incorporating density-dependent COTS mortality and selective predation. A key feature is the inclusion of an external larval immigration term (`cotsimm_dat`) that is modulated by sea surface temperature (SST), which serves as an outbreak trigger.

Critique and Identification of Oversimplification:
A major conceptual flaw exists in the COTS population dynamics. The model applies the temperature-dependent larval survival filter (`temp_effect`) only to external larval immigration. Local reproduction, represented by the `cots_growth` term, is not subject to this environmental filter. This is ecologically unrealistic, as larval survival and settlement, regardless of origin, are strongly governed by factors like SST. This omission prevents the model from capturing a critical positive feedback loop: a large, well-fed local COTS population produces a vast number of larvae, and if environmental conditions are favorable, this leads to massive local recruitment that sustains and amplifies the outbreak. The high literature-derived natural mortality rate (`m_c` = 2.56) makes the model dependent on a powerful, episodic recruitment mechanism to achieve outbreak densities, making this feedback essential.

Chosen Ecological Improvement:
I will restructure the COTS population dynamics equation to apply the temperature-dependent larval survival filter (`temp_effect`) to both local reproduction and external immigration. The change will be implemented by calculating a total larval pool (local reproduction + external immigration) and then applying the `temp_effect` to this entire pool to determine the total number of successful new recruits.

The COTS population at the next time step will be calculated as:
`COTS(t) = COTS(t-1) - Mortality(t-1) + Recruits(t-1)`

This modification correctly models the demographic processes and introduces the crucial positive feedback mechanism necessary for simulating the rapid escalation and sustainment of COTS outbreaks, directly addressing the core requirements of the project context without adding new parameters.
