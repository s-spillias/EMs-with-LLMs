Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures boom‚Äêbust cycles in COTS dynamics but its linear predation term may oversimplify the feeding interactions between COTS and coral communities. As an ecological improvement, we introduce a saturating functional response in the predation term. This captures the limited efficiency of food consumption at high coral densities, reducing overestimation of predation during outbreak events. This change is consistent with the ecological reality of feedback constraints on feeding and provides a more realistic trigger for outbreak dynamics.
