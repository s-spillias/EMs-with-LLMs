This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
It captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles by modeling intrinsic COTS population dynamics modulated by resource limitations
and selective predation on coral communities (fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porities).
Environmental conditions dynamically modify growth, recovery, and predation rates, triggering and sustaining outbreak events
while incorporating smooth transitions and feedback loops for numerical robustness.
