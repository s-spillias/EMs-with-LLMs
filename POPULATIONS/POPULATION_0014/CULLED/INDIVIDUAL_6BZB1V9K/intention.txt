Assessment:
Residual analysis indicates that the current model underestimates the initiation of outbreak events. The model does not currently include an Allee effectâ€”a process where COTS populations below a critical density experience negative growth due to, for example, mating difficulties. By introducing an Allee threshold parameter, the model now incorporates a density-dependent mechanism: populations below the threshold decline while those above can experience rapid, outbreak-like increases before being regulated by carrying capacity and predation.
