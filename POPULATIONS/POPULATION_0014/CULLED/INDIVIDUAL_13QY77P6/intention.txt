Assessment:
The current model uses logistic growth combined with saturating consumption functions. However, it lacks an explicit mechanism to trigger and sustain outbreak events, which are characterized by rapid boom‚Äêbust cycles. In ecological terms, when coral cover falls below a critical threshold, environmental conditions might favor a sudden boost in COTS growth due to reduced competition or altered habitat structure. 

Chosen Improvement:
We introduce an outbreak trigger mechanism based on coral cover. When the combined fast and slow coral cover (from t-1) falls below a defined threshold (new parameter: outbreak_trigger_threshold), the intrinsic COTS growth rate will be multiplied by a growth boost factor (new parameter: growth_boost). This reflects the ecological feedback whereby degraded coral environments precipitate explosive COTS outbreaks, better capturing the timing and magnitude of outbreak events.
