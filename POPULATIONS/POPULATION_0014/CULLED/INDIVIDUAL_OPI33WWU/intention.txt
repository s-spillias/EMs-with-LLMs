Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. Data Fit: Residuals indicate that while the model captures the timing of COTS outbreaks, predictions for coral cover (both fast- and slow-growing) systematically deviate from observations.
2. Model Context: The current formulation applies constant predation rates regardless of coral abundance. This oversimplification may overestimate coral losses when cover is low.
3. Ecological Process: A key process missing is the saturating efficiency of COTS predation on coral. When coral cover becomes scarce, encounter rates—and thus predation efficiency—should decline.
Improvement: Introduce a half‐saturation constant (coral_half_saturation) into the predation terms. This modification uses a saturating function to reduce predation efficiency when coral cover is low, better representing the ecological feedback that allows partial coral recovery post‐outbreak.
