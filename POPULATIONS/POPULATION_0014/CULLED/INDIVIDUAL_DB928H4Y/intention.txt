**Assessment of Current Model:**
The current model provides a solid foundation, incorporating key processes such as a Holling Type II functional response for COTS predation, logistic growth for two coral types (fast and slow-growing), and inter-specific competition between corals. However, its ability to reproduce the characteristic "boom-bust" cycles of COTS outbreaks is limited by an oversimplified mortality term. The current COTS mortality is a linear function of density (`m_c + m_c_den * COTS`), which does not adequately capture the non-linear dynamics that are thought to drive outbreak events. Specifically, it lacks a mechanism to represent a "predator pit," where COTS populations are controlled at low densities by generalist predators but can "escape" this control once their population surpasses a certain threshold, leading to an explosive increase in numbers. This is a critical feature for modeling the trigger and rapid escalation phase of an outbreak, as outlined in the project context.

**Proposed Ecological Improvement: Introduce Depensatory Mortality (Predator Pit)**

To better capture the boom-bust dynamics, I will introduce a non-linear, depensatory mortality term for the COTS population. This change replaces the constant natural mortality rate (`m_c`) with a more mechanistic formulation that represents predation pressure from generalist fish predators.

**Ecological Justification:**
The "predator pit" hypothesis is a leading explanation for COTS outbreaks. At low densities, COTS are effectively controlled by predation. However, as COTS density increases (e.g., following a larval recruitment pulse), these generalist predators become satiated. Their per-capita consumption rate on COTS levels off, meaning the per-capita *mortality rate* for COTS due to predation decreases sharply. This allows the COTS population to escape predation control and expand rapidly, triggering an outbreak.

**Mathematical Implementation:**
The new per-capita mortality rate for COTS will be structured as follows:
`Total Mortality = Baseline Mortality + Predation Mortality + Density-Dependent Mortality`

`cots_mortality = m_c_base + (pred_rate / (pred_h + cots_pred(t-1))) + m_c_den * cots_pred(t-1)`

Where:
- `m_c_base`: A new parameter for the baseline, density-independent natural mortality rate (e.g., from old age, non-predation disease).
- `pred_rate / (pred_h + cots_pred(t-1))`: This term models the per-capita mortality from generalist predators. It is derived from a Holling Type II functional response of predators to COTS. As COTS density (`cots_pred`) increases, this term decreases, representing predator satiation.
    - `pred_rate`: A new parameter for the maximum predation rate.
    - `pred_h`: A new parameter for the COTS density at which predators are half-satiated. This parameter effectively defines the density threshold for escaping the predator pit.
- `m_c_den * cots_pred(t-1)`: The existing term for density-dependent mortality at high population levels (e.g., from starvation or disease), which is retained.

This change replaces the single `m_c` parameter with three more mechanistically meaningful parameters (`m_c_base`, `pred_rate`, `pred_h`), providing a much stronger ecological basis for modeling the initiation and propagation of COTS outbreaks.
