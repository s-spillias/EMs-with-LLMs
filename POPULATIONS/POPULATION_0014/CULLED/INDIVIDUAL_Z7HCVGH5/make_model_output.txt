Below is our proposed plan and changes in brief:                                                                                                                                                                       

Assessment & Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The residuals indicate that the current logistic formulation underestimates the outbreak timing and amplitude. This suggests that additional mechanisms trigger and sustain COTS outbreaks. We add an environmental    
modifier—an "outbreak_modifier"—that amplifies COTS growth when predicted coral cover (i.e. the sum of fast and slow coral predictions) is high. This additional non‐linear term helps to capture the positive feedback
mechanism that may trigger outbreak events under favorable conditions. Importantly, only previous time step predictions are used.                                                                                      

We will update three parts:                                                                                                                                                                                            

 1 Insert the new parameter in model.cpp (after the predation_rate parameter).                                                                                                                                         
 2 Modify the COTS dynamics update in the for-loop in model.cpp to include the outbreak trigger.                                                                                                                       
 3 Update intention.txt with the assessment and reasoning.

 Assessment and Model Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                     
 Residual analysis revealed that the existing logistic formulation underestimates the timing and magnitude of Crown of Thorns (COTS) outbreak events. This shortcoming appears to stem from missing mechanisms that    
 trigger outbreaks under favorable environmental conditions.                                                                                                                                                           
 To address this, we introduce an "outbreak_modifier" parameter that amplifies COTS growth when coral cover (the sum of fast and slow coral predictions) is high. This simulates a positive feedback effect where high 
 coral availability triggers rapid population expansion, in line with ecological observations of episodic outbreaks. All predictions continue to use previous time step values to avoid data leakage.

 1 In parameters.json, insert an outbreak_modifier parameter object between the blocks for predation_rate and consumption_rate_fast. This ensures TMB can read the parameter and prevents the compile-time error.

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

Below is the updated SEARCH/REPLACE block. This block exactly matches the surrounding lines found in your current version of the file and adds the outbreak_modifier parameter in between the predation_rate and       
consumption_rate_fast parameters.
