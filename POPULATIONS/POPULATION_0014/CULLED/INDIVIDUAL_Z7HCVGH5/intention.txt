Assessment and Model Improvement:
Residual analysis revealed that the existing logistic formulation underestimates the timing and magnitude of Crown of Thorns (COTS) outbreak events. This shortcoming appears to stem from missing mechanisms that trigger outbreaks under favorable environmental conditions.
To address this, we introduce an "outbreak_modifier" parameter that amplifies COTS growth when coral cover (the sum of fast and slow coral predictions) is high. This simulates a positive feedback effect where high coral availability triggers rapid population expansion, in line with ecological observations of episodic outbreaks. All predictions continue to use previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
