Assessment:
The model is currently fitting data using an abrupt threshold for outbreak conditions which may oversimplify the ecological transition leading to COTS outbreaks. 
Our chosen improvement replaces the hard threshold with a sigmoidal function. This function gradually increases the effective growth rate as the COTS density approaches and exceeds a critical threshold.
We have added a new parameter "outbreak_steepness" to control the transition's rapidity. Ecologically, this modification better captures the gradual intensification of outbreak conditions and supports more realistic boom-bust dynamics.
