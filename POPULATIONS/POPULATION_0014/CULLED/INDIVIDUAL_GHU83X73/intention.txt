Assessment and Improvement:
The model currently uses a standard logistic growth term for the COTS dynamics, which may not fully capture the extreme boom‐bust cycles seen in outbreaks. To better capture these dynamics, we incorporate a non‐linear density‐dependent regulation by introducing a competition_exponent parameter. This exponent allows the growth term to adjust its sensitivity to intraspecific competition, representing resource limitation and crowding effects that intensify at high densities. This approach enhances the ecological realism in timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
