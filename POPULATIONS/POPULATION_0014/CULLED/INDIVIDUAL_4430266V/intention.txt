Assessment of the current model indicates that while the logistic growth with outbreak modulation effectively captures COTS dynamics, the recovery dynamics of the coral communities are oversimplified. Fast- and slow-growing corals are modeled independently without accounting for their competition for limited reef space. Given that both coral types share the same habitat, their recovery should be constrained by the combined coral cover. This modification introduces an interspecific competition mechanism that better reflects the ecological reality influencing the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreak events.
