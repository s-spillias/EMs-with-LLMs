Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
After evaluating the residuals and model performance, we found that the current model employs a linear outbreak trigger based on the sum of fast and slow coral cover. This approach oversimplifies the well-documented threshold behavior in COTS outbreaks. Ecologically, outbreaks tend to occur only when coral cover exceeds a critical level, leading to rapid population explosions followed by declines.
To better capture these dynamics, we introduce a sigmoidal outbreak trigger using a Hill function:
    outbreak_effect = outbreak_modifier * cots_pred(t-1) * ( (coral_cover^outbreak_exponent) / (coral_threshold^outbreak_exponent + coral_cover^outbreak_exponent) )
This non-linear formulation better represents the abrupt onset of outbreak conditions.
New parameters:
    - outbreak_exponent: Determines the steepness of the outbreak trigger.
    - coral_threshold: The coral cover threshold for triggering an outbreak.
