 1 Update intention.txt:                                                                                                                                                                                               
   We document that our assessment identified that while the current model uses linear coral cover to trigger outbreaks, the ecological process is likely nonlinear with a threshold effect. Our improvement uses a    
   sigmoidal (Hill‐function) formulation driven by two new parameters ("outbreak_exponent" and "coral_threshold"), which better captures the ecological reality of abrupt outbreak thresholds.

   We add two new parameters:                                                                                                                                                                                          
    • outbreak_exponent: A Hill coefficient that shapes the steepness of the outbreak trigger.                                                                                                                         
    • coral_threshold: The effective coral cover threshold at which outbreak triggering becomes significant.                                                                                                           
      These additions provide a more flexible, non‐linear representation of outbreak triggering.

   (a) In the parameter declarations, add new parameters for outbreak_exponent and coral_threshold.                                                                                                                    
   (b) In the COTS dynamics loop, replace the current linear outbreak trigger with the non‐linear sigmoidal formulation that computes                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    outbreak_effect = outbreak_modifier * cots_pred(t-1) * ( pow((fast_pred(t-1) + slow_pred(t-1)), outbreak_exponent) / ( pow(coral_threshold, outbreak_exponent) + pow((fast_pred(t-1) + slow_pred(t-1)),            
    outbreak_exponent) ) )                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
   so that only previous predictions are used and the outbreak is triggered in a threshold‐like manner.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                 
 After evaluating the residuals and model performance, we found that the current model employs a linear outbreak trigger based on the sum of fast and slow coral cover. This approach oversimplifies the well-document 
 threshold behavior in COTS outbreaks. Ecologically, outbreaks tend to occur only when coral cover exceeds a critical level, leading to rapid population explosions followed by declines.                              
 To better capture these dynamics, we introduce a sigmoidal outbreak trigger using a Hill function:                                                                                                                    
     outbreak_effect = outbreak_modifier * cots_pred(t-1) * ( (coral_cover^outbreak_exponent) / (coral_threshold^outbreak_exponent + coral_cover^outbreak_exponent) )                                                  
 This non-linear formulation better represents the abrupt onset of outbreak conditions.
