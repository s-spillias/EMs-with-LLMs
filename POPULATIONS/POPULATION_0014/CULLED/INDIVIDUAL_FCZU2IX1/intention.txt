This TMB model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS)
on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the boom‚Äêbust cycles in COTS
population dynamics through logistic growth coupled with an outbreak mechanism
implemented via a smooth threshold function. During outbreak events, COTS rapidly
increase in numbers, imposing selective predation pressure on two coral groups:
fast-growing Acropora species and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites corals.
The model incorporates multiple forms of resource limitation, environmental
modifiers, and feedback loops to sustain the dynamics while using mechanisms such as
saturating functions, smooth transitions (sigmoidal outbreak trigger), and robust
error handling (lognormal likelihood with minimum standard deviations) to ensure
numerical stability.
