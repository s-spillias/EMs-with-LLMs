Assessment and Model Improvement Reasoning:

The current model predicts COTS boom-bust dynamics with logistic growth and coral consumption; however, residual analysis indicates the model underestimates outbreaks when coral cover is very low. This suggests that the existing formulation may oversimplify the feedback mechanism between coral availability and COTS growth.

To better capture episodic outbreaks, we introduce an outbreak trigger mechanism. When the combined previous time step coral cover (fast + slow) falls below a defined threshold (outbreak_threshold), an additional growth boost (outbreak_boost) is applied to the COTS population. This adjustment simulates reduced predation pressure and resource limitation effects, reflecting the ecological reality that severely depleted coral cover can lead to rapid COTS population explosions.

This improvement, while adding slight complexity, is justified by observed outbreak behavior and enhances the model's ability to predict outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
