Assessment: The current model captures the main boom-bust cycles; however, residuals indicate systematic under-prediction during outbreak peaks and over-prediction during declines. This suggests that predation—implemented as a linear reduction—may be oversimplified. Ecologically, predators often become saturated (a Type II functional response), so their efficiency decreases as prey density increases. To address this and better capture the dynamics of episodic COTS outbreaks, we introduce a saturating predation term by adding a new parameter "predation_efficiency" that modulates the effective predation pressure. This change uses only lagged (previous time step) state values, avoiding data leakage.
