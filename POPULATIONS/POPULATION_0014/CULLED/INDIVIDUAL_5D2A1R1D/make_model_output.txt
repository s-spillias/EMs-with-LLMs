Below are the proposed changes. We're introducing a saturating predation term (representing a Type II functional response) by adding a new parameter predation_efficiency. This ecological improvement is justified    
because, during outbreak peaks, predators may become satiated so that their impact does not increase linearly with COTS density. Our changes update the model's mathematical form, add the new parameter (with         
ecological justification) to the parameter definitions, and update the intention.txt file with our assessment and reasoning.

 Assessment: The current model captures the main boom-bust cycles; however, residuals indicate systematic under-prediction during outbreak peaks and over-prediction during declines. This suggests that               
 predation—implemented as a linear reduction—may be oversimplified. Ecologically, predators often become saturated (a Type II functional response), so their efficiency decreases as prey density increases. To addres 
 this and better capture the dynamics of episodic COTS outbreaks, we introduce a saturating predation term by adding a new parameter "predation_efficiency" that modulates the effective predation pressure. This chan 
 uses only lagged (previous time step) state values, avoiding data leakage.
