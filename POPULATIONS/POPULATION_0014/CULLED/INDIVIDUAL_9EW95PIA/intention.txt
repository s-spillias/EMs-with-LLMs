This model simulates the dynamic interactions between Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and two distinct coral communities: fast-growing (e.g., Acropora) and slow-growing (e.g., Faviidae, Porites) species on the Great Barrier Reef.

The model's core ecological functions are:
1.  **Coral Growth and Competition:** Both coral types exhibit logistic growth, competing for limited reef space. Their growth rates are modulated by sea surface temperature (SST), with an optimal temperature for peak growth and reduced growth at sub-optimal temperatures.
2.  **COTS Predation:** The COTS population predates on both coral types. This interaction is modeled using a Holling Type II functional response, which means the predation rate per starfish saturates as coral becomes abundant. The model incorporates a preference parameter, allowing COTS to selectively predate more heavily on the fast-growing, energy-rich Acropora corals.
3.  **COTS Population Dynamics:** COTS population growth is directly linked to the amount of coral consumed, via an assimilation efficiency parameter. The population is regulated by a constant natural mortality rate and a density-dependent mortality term that increases mortality at high population densities, contributing to the "bust" phase of an outbreak.
4.  **Outbreak Triggers:** The model includes an external forcing for COTS larval immigration. This term allows for simulating the initiation of primary outbreaks from external sources, a key hypothesis for large-scale COTS population explosions.

Together, these processes create a feedback system characteristic of boom-bust cycles. A COTS outbreak drastically reduces coral cover, which in turn limits the COTS food supply, leading to a population crash and allowing for the slow recovery of the coral community.
