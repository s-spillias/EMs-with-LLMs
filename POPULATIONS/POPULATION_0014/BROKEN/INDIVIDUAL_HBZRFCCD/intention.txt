Assessment: The current model adequately represents outbreak dynamics using logistic‐style COTS growth and coral regeneration. However, the assumption of a linear predation impact on coral is too simplistic, especially at high COTS densities. In reality, the predation rate may saturate due to limitations in predator handling time and coral availability (Holling Type‐II response). This resource limitation mechanism better captures the diminishing marginal impact of further increases in COTS on coral cover. Accordingly, we introduced two new saturation parameters for fast- and slow-growing coral predation.
