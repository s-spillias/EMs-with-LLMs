This revision aims to improve the ecological realism of the model by incorporating a saturating resource limitation mechanism for coral regeneration. Previously, coral regeneration was modeled linearly as coral_regen * (100 - coral_cover), which may lead to overestimated recovery when coral cover is very low. By introducing the parameter Km_coral, the regeneration term is now modeled in a Michaelisâ€“Menten form:
   (100 - coral_cover) / (Km_coral + (100 - coral_cover)),
which better captures the diminishing returns in recovery as available substrate becomes limiting. This change is consistent with observed boom-bust cycles in Crown of Thorns starfish outbreaks and their effects on coral communities.
