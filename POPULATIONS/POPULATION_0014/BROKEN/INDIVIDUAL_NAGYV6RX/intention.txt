Project Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

1. Model Assessment:
   - The current model adequately fits the data overall but shows systematic deviations in the onset and magnitude of outbreaks.
   - The binary outbreak trigger (using a hard threshold) oversimplifies the ecological process.

2. Addressing the Project Context:
   - Episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish are known to transition gradually rather than abruptly.
   - The boom-bust cycle and selective coral predation are captured; however, the mechanism triggering outbreak escalation appears overly simplistic.

3. Identified Improvement:
   - Replace the binary outbreak trigger with a sigmoidal function to represent a gradual increase in the outbreak multiplier.
   - Ecologically, this reflects that as COTS density approaches a threshold, the likelihood and intensity of outbreak effects increase nonlinearly.

This change adds a new parameter, "outbreak_slope", which controls the steepness of the sigmoidal transition. This improves the model by better capturing the timing and magnitude of outbreak conditions in an ecologically realistic manner.
