This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and its interaction with two distinct coral groups on the Great Barrier Reef: fast-growing Acropora species and slow-growing corals like Faviidae and Porites.

The model's core is a predator-prey framework. COTS act as the predator, with population growth fueled by the consumption of both coral types, exhibiting a preference for the faster-growing Acropora. The characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS are modeled through a combination of factors: logistic growth from predation, density-dependent mortality at high population levels, and outbreak initiation by external larval immigration events, which act as a forcing variable.

The two coral populations serve as the prey and a limited resource. They compete for space and grow logistically toward a total carrying capacity. Their populations are reduced by COTS predation. This interaction is modeled using a multi-species Holling Type II functional response, which accounts for prey preference and predator saturation.

Environmental conditions, specifically sea-surface temperature (SST), are incorporated to modulate COTS feeding rates, reflecting the metabolic influence of temperature on the starfish. The model aims to predict the temporal changes in the abundance of COTS, fast-growing corals, and slow-growing corals, thereby capturing the cascading effects of COTS outbreaks on the coral community structure.
