This document contains the modeler's intention and rationale for modifications.
Assessment:
- The previous model used a step function for the outbreak multiplier, which leads to abrupt transitions that residuals suggest may not capture the gradual onset of outbreak events.
Improvement:
- Replace the step function with a smooth Hill function to scale the outbreak multiplier continuously based on the previous time stepâ€™s COTS density.
- A new parameter "outbreak_hill_exp" is added to control the steepness of the transition. A higher exponent produces a sharper transition while a lower value yields a smoother change.
- This improvement better captures the ecological dynamics underpinning gradual outbreak initiation while preserving the integrity (using only past data) of the model.
