Assessment:
The current model captures the boom–bust dynamics and outbreak triggering reasonably well. However, the linear predation terms for both fast- and slow-growing corals are oversimplifications. Ecologically, as coral cover declines, the effectiveness of predation should saturate due to limited prey availability.

Chosen improvement:
We introduce a saturating functional response (Michaelis–Menten type) for coral predation. Two new parameters, "coral_fast_halvesat" and "coral_slow_halvesat", represent the half‐saturation constants where the predation impact levels off. This added realism helps capture resource limitations and feedback mechanisms more accurately in the context of episodic COTS outbreaks.
