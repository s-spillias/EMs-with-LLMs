Assessment & Model Revision:
-----------------------------
After examining the residuals and model performance, it appears that the linear predation term for coral cover oversimplifies the observed dynamics. This modification incorporates a saturating functional response in the predation terms for both fast-growing and slow-growing corals to model decreased predation efficiency at higher coral cover values due to handling time constraints. This improvement is expected to more accurately capture the characteristic boomâ€“bust cycles observed during COTS outbreaks.
