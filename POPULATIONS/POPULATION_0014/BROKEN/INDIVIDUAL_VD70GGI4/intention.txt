This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
1. The model captures boomâ€“bust cycles where COTS rapidly increase and then decline.
2. It accounts for selective predation on coral communities, differentiating between fast-growing Acropora species and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites.
3. Multiple resource-limiting mechanisms (saturating functions, threshold effects) and environmental modifiers are incorporated.
4. Feedback loops between coral cover and outbreak triggers are modeled to sustain or dampen outbreak events.
