This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks by incorporating:

1. Temperature-dependent larval recruitment and survival
2. Differential predation on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) coral species
3. Density-dependent mortality of adult COTS
4. Coral growth dynamics with competition between coral types
5. Feedback mechanisms between coral cover and COTS population growth

The model accounts for episodic larval immigration events that can trigger outbreaks, as well as the subsequent population crashes when coral food resources become depleted. Environmental factors, particularly sea surface temperature (SST), modulate both coral growth and COTS reproduction. The model is designed to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, providing insights for reef management strategies.
