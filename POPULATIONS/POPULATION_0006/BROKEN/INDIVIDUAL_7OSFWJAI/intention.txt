# Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

## Current Model Assessment

1. **Data Fit Analysis**:
   - The model significantly overestimates both fast and slow-growing coral cover, showing constant high values (around 60% for fast-growing and 40% for slow-growing) while historical data shows much lower, fluctuating values.
   - COTS predictions show oscillatory patterns but don't match the timing or magnitude of historical observations.
   - The model fails to capture the declining trend in coral cover observed in historical data.

2. **Project Context Alignment**:
   - While the model includes mechanisms for COTS outbreaks (temperature effects, immigration), it doesn't effectively capture the boom-bust cycles evident in the data.
   - The selective predation on different coral types is included, but the model doesn't accurately represent the impact of COTS on coral communities.
   - The current parameterization results in unrealistic coral resilience to COTS predation.

3. **Missing or Oversimplified Processes**:
   - The model lacks a size-structured approach for COTS populations, which is important for outbreak dynamics.
   - There's no explicit representation of coral recovery delays after COTS outbreaks.
   - The model doesn't account for potential Allee effects in COTS populations during low-density periods.
   - Environmental stochasticity effects on COTS reproduction and survival are oversimplified.

## Proposed Improvement: Coral Recovery Delay and COTS Size Structure

I'm implementing a dual improvement approach focusing on:

1. **Coral Recovery Delay**: Adding a recovery delay parameter for corals after COTS predation to represent the realistic lag in coral regrowth after significant damage. This addresses the model's current overestimation of coral resilience.

2. **COTS Size Structure**: Implementing a simplified two-stage (juvenile/adult) structure for COTS populations to better capture outbreak dynamics. This includes:
   - Separate juvenile and adult COTS compartments
   - Maturation rate from juvenile to adult stage
   - Different mortality rates for each stage
   - Only adults consume coral and reproduce

These improvements directly address the project's focus on accurately capturing COTS outbreak dynamics and their impact on coral communities. The size structure allows for more realistic representation of population growth delays and the coral recovery delay addresses the unrealistic resilience currently shown in the model.

The mathematical implementation balances added complexity with ecological realism, focusing on key processes that drive the boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks and their long-term effects on coral communities.
