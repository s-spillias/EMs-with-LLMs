Goal: Predict episodic boomâ€“bust dynamics of Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS; individuals m^-2) and co-occurring coral cover (%; fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites) on the Great Barrier Reef, emphasizing timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.

Core ecological functioning:
- Bottom-up control and thresholds: Adult COTS fecundity increases with food intake from corals through a saturating (Holling) functional response with a sigmoidal (Type III) prey-dependence to produce outbreak thresholds. A smooth Allee effect captures low fertilization success at low densities, enabling abrupt transitions once a critical density is surpassed.
- Environmental modulation: Temperature modifies COTS reproduction and coral growth via smooth Gaussian thermal performance curves. Heat-stress induces additional smooth coral mortality (bleaching ramp) when SST exceeds a threshold.
- Trophic feedbacks: COTS preferentially consume fast-growing Acropora, with adjustable preference, while also consuming slow-growing corals at lower rates. Predation reduces coral cover, which in turn limits future COTS fecundity, producing self-limiting outbreaks and busts.
- Immigration pulses: External larval supply (immigration data) augments recruitment with an efficiency factor, providing outbreak triggers consistent with observed episodic pulses.
- Coral competition and capacity: Each coral group grows logistically toward a shared carrying capacity (proportion of reef area) with inter-group competition coefficients, ensuring realistic space limitation and indirect competition.

Numerical and statistical approach:
- Smooth, bounded flows: All rates use small constants to avoid division by zero; consumption is capped smoothly so losses never exceed available coral. Transitions (e.g., bleaching onset, Allee effect) are smooth and differentiable.
- State updating: Next-step predictions use only previous-step predictions and forcings (no data leakage). Initial conditions are set to the first observed values.
- Likelihood: Observations for COTS and both coral groups enter the likelihood at every time point using lognormal errors with minimum standard deviations to stabilize fits across scales.

Outcome:
The model reproduces characteristic outbreak waves by combining food-dependent reproduction with Allee thresholds, immigration triggers, prey selectivity, temperature-sensitive vital rates, and resource competition, yielding realistic timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions and subsequent declines.
