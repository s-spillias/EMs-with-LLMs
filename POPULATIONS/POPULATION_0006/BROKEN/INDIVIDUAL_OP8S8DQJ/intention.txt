# Model Assessment and Improvement

## Current Model Assessment

1. **Data Fit Analysis**:
   - The slow coral prediction shows reasonable tracking of historical trends until ~1995, but fails to capture the high variability in the historical data, especially the peaks around 1990-1992.
   - The fast coral prediction significantly overestimates values after 1995, failing to capture the decline in historical data.
   - The COTS prediction completely misses the major outbreak peaks (around 1990 and 1994), showing a much smoother trajectory than the highly variable historical data.

2. **Project Context Alignment**:
   - The model does not effectively capture the episodic outbreak dynamics of COTS, which is a central requirement of the project.
   - The boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS populations are not reproduced in the model predictions.
   - The selective predation effects on different coral types are implemented, but their impact is not accurately reflected in the dynamics.

3. **Missing/Oversimplified Ecological Processes**:
   - The model lacks a strong mechanism for triggering sudden COTS outbreaks.
   - Predator-prey dynamics are oversimplified, missing potential Allee effects or critical thresholds.
   - The model doesn't account for potential time lags in population responses.
   - Density-dependent effects on COTS reproduction and mortality may be inadequately represented.

## Proposed Improvement: Threshold-Based Outbreak Dynamics with Maximum Numerical Stability

I'm implementing a threshold-based outbreak mechanism with time-lagged effects to better capture the episodic nature of COTS outbreaks. This approach addresses several key ecological processes:

1. **Ecological Justification**:
   - COTS outbreaks often exhibit threshold dynamics where population growth accelerates dramatically once certain environmental conditions are met.
   - Research suggests that favorable conditions (nutrients, temperature) can trigger reproductive booms with a time lag.
   - Outbreaks typically require both favorable environmental conditions AND sufficient coral resources.

2. **Mathematical Approach**:
   - Implementing a threshold response to environmental conditions (SST and coral availability).
   - Adding a time-lagged effect to represent the delay between favorable conditions and population response.
   - Incorporating a stronger density-dependent mortality effect during high population densities to capture the "bust" phase.

3. **Numerical Stability Improvements**:
   - Completely redesigned the model with maximum numerical stability in mind
   - Used tanh() instead of logistic function for the outbreak response to improve stability
   - Fixed the steepness parameter to a moderate value (5.0) to avoid extreme slopes
   - Increased the small constant (eps) to 0.01 to prevent division by zero issues
   - Used a fixed time lag of 2 years
   - Simplified all mathematical expressions
   - Added bounds checking for all division operations and state variables
   - Reduced the magnitude of the outbreak effect
   - Increased the constant added to observations in the likelihood calculation
   - Removed all penalty terms that could cause gradient issues
   - Used ternary operators instead of if-statements for better gradient calculation

This improvement should better reproduce the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations while maintaining a mechanistic understanding of the underlying ecological processes and ensuring numerical stability during model fitting.
