Assessment of Current Model:

The current model includes basic coral-COTS interactions but fails to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks. Specifically:
1. It underestimates peak COTS densities during outbreak periods (1990-1995)
2. It doesn't adequately represent the rapid population explosions followed by crashes
3. It overestimates coral recovery rates after outbreaks, particularly for fast-growing corals

Ecological Improvement:

I'm implementing a delayed density-dependent recruitment mechanism with environmental thresholds to better capture COTS outbreak dynamics. This improvement includes:

1. Time-lagged recruitment effects: COTS reproduction success depends on both adult density and environmental conditions from previous years, representing the ~2-year larval development period. This fixed 2-year lag is based on COTS biology and development time.

2. Nutrient-enhanced reproduction: Added a nutrient threshold effect that can trigger enhanced reproduction when environmental conditions are favorable. This represents the well-documented link between terrestrial runoff, phytoplankton blooms, and COTS larval survival.

3. Density-dependent mortality: Enhanced the mortality function to increase during high-density periods, representing predation pressure and disease spread during outbreaks. This captures the natural population regulation that occurs when COTS reach high densities.

4. Coral recovery lag: Added a recovery delay for corals after severe predation, representing the ecological reality that heavily damaged reefs take longer to recover. This mechanism is particularly important for explaining the prolonged impact of COTS outbreaks.

These changes better represent the ecological mechanisms driving COTS outbreaks, including:
- The delayed effects of terrestrial runoff and nutrient inputs
- The non-linear population responses when environmental thresholds are crossed
- The boom-bust cycle characteristic of COTS populations
- The prolonged impact on coral communities after outbreaks

The mathematical implementation has been simplified to improve numerical stability while maintaining the key ecological mechanisms. I've used a fixed 2-year recruitment lag based on COTS biology and implemented simpler, more stable mathematical forms (linear and rational functions instead of exponential and sigmoid functions) to avoid optimization issues. These simplifications maintain the essential ecological dynamics while ensuring the model can be reliably fitted to data.
