Assessment of Current Model:

1. Model Fit Analysis:
   - The model significantly underestimates COTS outbreak peaks (1990-1995)
   - Fast-growing coral predictions don't capture post-1995 dynamics accurately
   - Slow-growing coral variability is poorly represented, especially during 1990-1992
   - Overall, the model fails to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations

2. Project Context Alignment:
   - While the model includes basic predator-prey dynamics, it doesn't adequately address the central focus of modeling "episodic outbreaks" and "boom-bust cycles"
   - The timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions are not well represented
   - The selective predation effects on different coral types are included but their impacts during outbreaks are not accurately captured

3. Missing Ecological Processes:
   - Nutrient-mediated recruitment enhancement - a key driver of COTS outbreaks
   - Density-dependent predation refuge effects
   - Delayed response mechanisms that could create the characteristic outbreak cycles
   - Realistic thresholds for outbreak initiation

Proposed Improvement: Nutrient-Mediated Recruitment Enhancement

I'm implementing a nutrient-mediated recruitment mechanism that better captures the ecological processes driving COTS outbreaks. Research shows that terrestrial nutrient runoff enhances phytoplankton blooms, which dramatically increases COTS larval survival and recruitment success. This creates a positive feedback loop where favorable conditions can trigger explosive population growth.

The implementation includes:
1. A new parameter (nutrient_effect) representing the strength of nutrient enhancement on recruitment
2. A nutrient-dependent modifier to the COTS growth term that increases recruitment during high SST periods (proxy for nutrient-rich conditions)
3. A threshold-based response that creates non-linear population growth when conditions are favorable
4. A density-dependent predation refuge effect where high COTS densities overwhelm coral defenses

This improvement directly addresses the project's focus on "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events" by incorporating a key ecological driver of COTS population explosions. The mathematical formulation creates the potential for rapid population increases followed by crashes when coral resources are depleted - the characteristic boom-bust cycle central to the project context.
