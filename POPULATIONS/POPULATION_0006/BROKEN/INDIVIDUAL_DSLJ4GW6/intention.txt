Model Assessment:

1. Current model fit evaluation:
   - The model poorly captures the dynamics of both coral types and COTS populations
   - For slow-growing coral: The model predicts a constant value (~40%) while historical data shows a declining trend from ~15% to ~5%
   - For fast-growing coral: The model predicts a constant value (~60%) while historical data shows high variability (2-45%)
   - For COTS: The model shows cyclic patterns but fails to match the timing and magnitude of historical outbreaks

2. Project context alignment issues:
   - The model fails to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks
   - It doesn't accurately represent the selective predation impacts on different coral types
   - The timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions are not well-represented

3. Missing or oversimplified ecological processes:
   - Coral recovery dynamics after COTS predation are oversimplified
   - The model lacks density-dependent predation behavior of COTS
   - There's no representation of coral size/age structure affecting COTS feeding preferences
   - Environmental triggers for COTS outbreaks beyond temperature are missing

Proposed Improvement: Density-Dependent Feeding Preference Switching

I'm implementing a density-dependent feeding preference mechanism where COTS shift their feeding preference based on relative coral abundance. This ecological improvement addresses a key aspect of COTS behavior: they preferentially feed on fast-growing corals (like Acropora) but will switch to slow-growing corals when preferred coral becomes scarce.

This improvement will:
1. Create more realistic boom-bust cycles as COTS deplete preferred coral then switch to alternative food sources
2. Better represent the selective predation impacts on different coral communities
3. Introduce an indirect feedback mechanism where coral community composition affects COTS population dynamics

The mathematical implementation uses a sigmoid function to model the preference switching behavior, creating a smooth transition as preferred coral becomes depleted. This approach maintains model parsimony while adding an ecologically meaningful mechanism that better captures the system dynamics relevant to the project context.
