Assessment of Current Model:

1. Model Fit Analysis:
   - The current model shows significant discrepancies between historical and modeled data
   - Fast coral prediction: The model fails to capture the high variability and peaks in fast-growing coral cover, particularly the major peak around 1990
   - COTS prediction: The model misses the outbreak peaks around 1990 and 1995
   - Slow coral prediction: The model smooths out the natural fluctuations in slow-growing coral cover

2. Project Context Alignment:
   - The model does not adequately capture the "boom-bust cycles" of COTS outbreaks
   - The timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions are not well represented
   - The impact of these outbreaks on coral communities is underestimated

3. Missing/Oversimplified Ecological Processes:
   - Outbreak triggering mechanisms are insufficiently represented
   - The model lacks a proper threshold response for COTS population explosions
   - Nutrient-driven phytoplankton dynamics that fuel COTS larval success are not included
   - The model doesn't account for potential Allee effects in COTS populations

Proposed Improvement:
I'm implementing a nutrient-driven outbreak threshold mechanism for COTS population dynamics. Research suggests that COTS outbreaks are strongly linked to nutrient runoff events that increase phytoplankton availability, which in turn enhances larval survival and recruitment success. This creates a non-linear response where COTS populations can suddenly explode when conditions are favorable.

The improvement adds:
1. A nutrient-threshold response function that creates a stronger positive feedback in COTS recruitment when environmental conditions are favorable
2. A modified temperature effect that incorporates both optimal temperature and a threshold response
3. An enhanced immigration effect that better captures the episodic nature of COTS outbreaks

This approach addresses the core project requirement to model "episodic outbreaks" and "boom-bust cycles" by introducing the necessary non-linear dynamics and threshold responses that drive real-world COTS population explosions.
