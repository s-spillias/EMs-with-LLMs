Assessment of Current Model:

The current model fails to adequately capture several key aspects of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) outbreak dynamics:

1. The model significantly underestimates COTS population peaks during outbreak periods (1990-1995), missing the magnitude of population explosions by more than 50%.

2. The model overestimates fast-growing coral cover after 1995, failing to capture the dramatic decline following COTS outbreaks.

3. The model doesn't adequately represent the slow-growing coral dynamics, missing both the peaks and the recovery patterns.

4. The current implementation lacks mechanisms that would trigger and sustain the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations.

Proposed Improvement - Allee Effect and Density-Dependent Predation:

I'm implementing two ecological mechanisms to better capture COTS outbreak dynamics:

1. Allee Effect: COTS populations exhibit positive density dependence at low densities (reproductive success increases with density) due to fertilization efficiency, followed by negative density dependence at high densities. This creates a threshold-like response that can trigger rapid population growth once a critical density is reached.

2. Density-Dependent Predation Preference: COTS show density-dependent feeding behavior, where their preference for fast vs. slow-growing coral changes based on their population density. During outbreaks (high density), they become less selective and increase predation on normally less-preferred slow-growing corals.

These mechanisms better represent the ecological processes driving COTS outbreaks by:
- Creating the potential for explosive population growth once a threshold is crossed
- Capturing the shift in feeding behavior during outbreaks
- Allowing for more realistic boom-bust cycles
- Better representing the differential impact on coral communities

The mathematical implementation uses a modified logistic growth function with an Allee threshold parameter and a density-dependent switching function for predation preference.
