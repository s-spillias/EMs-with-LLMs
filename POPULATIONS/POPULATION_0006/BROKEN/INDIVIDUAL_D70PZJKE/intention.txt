# Model Assessment and Improvement

## Current Model Assessment

1. **Model Fit to Data**:
   - Slow-growing coral: The model captures the general declining trend but misses the high variability in historical data, especially after 1995.
   - COTS: The model shows a massive outbreak between 1990-1995 that greatly exceeds historical observations. This suggests the model is overestimating COTS population growth during outbreak conditions.
   - Fast-growing coral: The model captures the general trend but misses peak values around 1990 and underestimates the variability throughout the time series.

2. **Addressing Project Context**:
   - The model includes key components for COTS-coral dynamics but fails to accurately capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
   - The boom-bust cycles are present but exaggerated compared to historical data.
   - The selective predation mechanism is included but may not be properly calibrated.

3. **Missing or Oversimplified Processes**:
   - The model lacks density-dependent predation pressure on COTS, which is a key mechanism controlling their population.
   - There's no representation of COTS size/age structure, which affects predation rates and vulnerability.
   - The temperature effect is overly simplified, not accounting for potential negative effects at extreme temperatures.
   - The model doesn't include spatial dynamics or connectivity between reefs.

## Proposed Improvement: Predator-Driven COTS Population Control

The most significant issue is the model's overestimation of COTS outbreaks. In reality, COTS populations are regulated by predators like the giant triton snail, certain fish species, and other natural enemies. I'm adding a density-dependent predation term that increases with COTS abundance, representing how natural predators help control COTS populations.

This improvement addresses a key ecological process missing from the original model - the natural control mechanisms that help terminate COTS outbreaks. By implementing a density-dependent mortality term, we can better capture the self-limiting nature of COTS outbreaks without adding excessive complexity.

The mathematical form I've implemented is:

mortality_rate = pred_rate * (1 + cots_density)
mortality = mortality_rate * cots_density

This formulation combines:
1. A baseline mortality rate (pred_rate * cots_density)
2. An additional density-dependent mortality (pred_rate * cots_density * cots_density)

This represents how predation pressure increases non-linearly with COTS density. When COTS are rare, predation pressure is low, but as COTS become more abundant during outbreaks, predation increases more rapidly. This helps explain why COTS outbreaks eventually collapse even when coral prey is still available.

The approach is ecologically justified as many marine predators exhibit switching behavior, focusing on prey items that become abundant. For COTS, documented predators include the giant triton snail (Charonia tritonis), certain fish species like pufferfish and triggerfish, and other natural enemies. As COTS density increases, these predators may:
1. Be more likely to encounter COTS
2. Develop search images for COTS
3. Switch from alternative prey to focus on the now-abundant COTS

This density-dependent mortality term helps regulate COTS population explosions in a more realistic manner and should improve the model's ability to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles observed in real COTS populations.
