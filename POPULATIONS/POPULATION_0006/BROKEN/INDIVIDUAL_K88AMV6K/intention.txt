# Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

## Current Model Assessment

1. **Data Fit Analysis**:
   - The slow-growing coral model shows moderate fit but misses key fluctuations in historical data, particularly the peaks around 1990-1992.
   - The fast-growing coral model captures the general trend but significantly overestimates values after 1995, failing to track the dramatic decline in historical data.
   - The COTS population model consistently underestimates historical peaks, missing the major outbreak events around 1990 and 1994.

2. **Project Context Alignment**:
   - The current model partially addresses the boom-bust cycles of COTS but fails to accurately capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events.
   - The selective predation mechanism exists but doesn't adequately reflect the complex dynamics between COTS and different coral types.
   - The model lacks sufficient mechanisms to trigger and sustain realistic outbreak events.

3. **Missing Ecological Processes**:
   - Absence of Allee effects in COTS reproduction during low population densities
   - Limited representation of threshold-dependent outbreak dynamics
   - No explicit modeling of larval survival and recruitment success
   - Insufficient connectivity between coral cover and COTS reproductive success

## Proposed Improvement: Threshold-Based Reproductive Success with Allee Effect

I propose implementing a threshold-based reproductive success mechanism with an Allee effect for COTS population dynamics. This improvement addresses a critical ecological process: COTS populations exhibit positive density dependence at low densities (Allee effect) but can experience explosive growth once they cross certain threshold densities.

### Ecological Justification:
COTS reproduction success depends on population density due to:
1. Fertilization efficiency - at low densities, eggs may not be fertilized due to dilution effects
2. Group predator defense - larger groups experience lower per-capita predation
3. Synchronized spawning - larger populations achieve better spawning synchronization

Once a critical threshold is crossed, reproductive success increases dramatically, leading to outbreak conditions. This better explains the episodic nature of outbreaks observed in the historical data.

### Mathematical Implementation:
The improvement adds a density-dependent reproductive success modifier with both Allee effects at low densities and a threshold-based transition to outbreak conditions. This creates a more realistic representation of the boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS populations on the Great Barrier Reef.
