This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral reef ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef. The model focuses on capturing the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks while accounting for their selective predation on different coral functional groups.

Key ecological processes included:
1. COTS population dynamics influenced by sea surface temperature (SST) and larval immigration
2. Differential predation by COTS on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) corals
3. Coral growth and recovery dynamics with density dependence
4. Temperature effects on both COTS reproduction and coral growth/mortality

The model incorporates multiple feedback mechanisms:
- Coral cover affects COTS survival through resource availability
- COTS density affects predation rates through functional responses
- Temperature anomalies affect both COTS reproduction and coral mortality

The model aims to predict:
- Timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks
- Impacts on coral community composition
- Recovery trajectories of coral communities following outbreaks
- Potential effects of changing environmental conditions on outbreak dynamics

This mechanistic approach allows for exploring management interventions and climate change scenarios to inform conservation strategies for the Great Barrier Reef.
