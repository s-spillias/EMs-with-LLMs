Assessment of Current Model:
The current model includes basic population dynamics for COTS and coral species, with temperature effects on COTS recruitment, coral bleaching, and predation. However, it fails to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks seen in the historical data. The model produces overly smoothed predictions that miss the sharp peaks in COTS abundance around 1990-1995 and the corresponding impacts on coral cover.

Proposed Improvement:
I'm implementing two key ecological mechanisms to better capture COTS outbreak dynamics:

1. Allee Effect in COTS Population: COTS reproduction success increases non-linearly with population density due to fertilization efficiency at higher densities. This positive density dependence at low-to-medium densities can help trigger rapid population growth once a threshold is crossed.

2. Nutrient-Driven Recruitment Pulses: COTS outbreaks are strongly linked to nutrient runoff events (often following heavy rainfall) that increase phytoplankton availability for COTS larvae. I'm adding a nutrient-driven recruitment modifier based on sea surface temperature as a proxy for rainfall/runoff events.

These mechanisms create the conditions for episodic outbreaks rather than smooth population changes. The Allee effect creates a threshold-like response where populations can suddenly explode once a critical density is reached. The nutrient pulse mechanism provides the environmental trigger for these outbreaks, consistent with empirical observations from the Great Barrier Reef.

Implementation Note:
To ensure numerical stability in the model, I've implemented these mechanisms using discrete threshold functions rather than continuous functions. This approach maintains the ecological meaning of the Allee effect and nutrient pulses while avoiding gradient evaluation issues during optimization. The threshold-based approach creates the step-change dynamics needed to generate boom-bust cycles while ensuring the model can be reliably fitted to data.

The simplified implementation focuses on capturing the essential ecological mechanisms while maintaining computational stability:
1. The Allee effect is implemented as a step function with three levels (low, medium, high) based on population density
2. The nutrient effect is implemented as a simple threshold function triggered by high temperatures
3. Predation and bleaching functions have been simplified to improve numerical stability
