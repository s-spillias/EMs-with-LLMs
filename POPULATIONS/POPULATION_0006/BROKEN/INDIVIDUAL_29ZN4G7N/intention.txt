This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks through several key mechanisms:

1. COTS population dynamics: The model tracks adult COTS abundance, incorporating density-dependent reproduction, natural mortality, and larval immigration.

2. Coral community dynamics: Two functional groups of corals are modeled - fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.), each with distinct growth rates and susceptibility to COTS predation.

3. Environmental triggers: Sea surface temperature (SST) influences both coral growth and COTS reproduction, serving as a potential trigger for outbreak events.

4. Predator-prey interactions: COTS preferentially feed on fast-growing corals but will switch to slow-growing corals as the preferred resource becomes depleted, using a modified functional response.

5. Feedback mechanisms: The model incorporates feedback loops where coral cover affects COTS reproduction and survival, while COTS abundance affects coral mortality through predation.

The model aims to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks while accounting for their selective impact on different coral communities. It uses a state-space modeling approach with process error to capture stochasticity in population dynamics and observation error to account for imperfect sampling of field data.
