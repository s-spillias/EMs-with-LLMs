# Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

## Current Model Assessment
The current model fails to capture several key dynamics observed in the data:
1. The model predicts constant coral cover values (around 40% for slow-growing and 60% for fast-growing) while actual data shows significant variability and declining trends.
2. COTS population dynamics show cyclic patterns in the model but don't match the timing, magnitude, or frequency of observed outbreaks.
3. The model doesn't effectively capture the boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS outbreaks.

## Ecological Improvement: Allee Effect and Outbreak Threshold Dynamics
I'm implementing a modified COTS population model that incorporates:

1. **Allee effect with outbreak threshold**: COTS populations exhibit different growth dynamics at different densities. Below a critical threshold, growth is limited, but once this threshold is exceeded, population growth accelerates dramatically, creating the characteristic outbreak pattern.

2. **Density-dependent predation efficiency**: As COTS density increases during outbreaks, their per-capita predation rate on corals increases due to aggregation behavior and reduced predator avoidance, intensifying their impact during outbreaks.

These modifications better represent the ecological reality of COTS outbreaks, where populations can remain at low levels for extended periods before rapidly increasing to outbreak levels when conditions are favorable. The threshold-dependent growth and predation rates create the non-linear dynamics necessary to generate boom-bust cycles observed in real COTS populations.

The mathematical implementation uses a sigmoid function to model the transition between low-density and outbreak states, providing a smooth but rapid shift in population dynamics when thresholds are crossed. This approach maintains model stability while capturing the essential non-linear dynamics of COTS outbreaks.
