# Model Assessment and Improvement

## Current Model Assessment

1. **Data Fit Assessment**:
   - The slow-growing coral model shows poor fit to historical data, particularly missing the high variability and peaks around 1990-1995
   - The fast-growing coral model captures the general trend but fails to match the historical peak around 1990 and underestimates variability
   - The COTS model significantly underestimates outbreak peaks (especially around 1990-1992) and doesn't capture the boom-bust dynamics well

2. **Project Context Alignment**:
   - The model includes basic predator-prey dynamics between COTS and coral types
   - However, it fails to adequately capture the episodic outbreak patterns that are central to the project goals
   - The characteristic boom-bust cycles are not well represented in the current predictions

3. **Missing/Oversimplified Ecological Processes**:
   - Allee effects in COTS reproduction are not represented (population density thresholds for successful reproduction)
   - Predation on juvenile COTS is oversimplified, missing the critical role of predator release in outbreak initiation
   - Delayed density-dependent feedback mechanisms that contribute to population crashes are not adequately modeled
   - Spatial connectivity and larval transport dynamics are only crudely represented through the immigration term

## Proposed Improvement: Allee Effects and Predator-Mediated Population Control

I'm implementing a more ecologically realistic representation of COTS population dynamics by adding:

1. **Allee Effect**: A positive density-dependent effect at low densities, where reproduction becomes more efficient as population increases up to a threshold. This better represents the reproductive dynamics of COTS where fertilization success depends on proximity of adults.

2. **Predator-Mediated Control**: A non-linear predation pressure that decreases as COTS populations grow beyond predator control thresholds, representing predator saturation. This captures how natural predators can control COTS at low densities but become overwhelmed during outbreaks.

These mechanisms are critical for generating the boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS outbreaks. When COTS populations are low, predation keeps them controlled. Once they exceed a threshold where predation becomes ineffective and Allee effects enhance reproduction, populations can explode rapidly. The subsequent population crash occurs when coral resources are depleted.

This improvement directly addresses the project's focus on "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" and the "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events."
