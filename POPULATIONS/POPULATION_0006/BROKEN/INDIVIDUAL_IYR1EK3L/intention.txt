# Model Assessment and Improvement

## Current Model Assessment
1. The model shows moderate fit to historical data but fails to capture key dynamics:
   - COTS outbreaks: The model underestimates peak outbreak magnitudes (1990-1995)
   - Fast-growing coral: The model overestimates recovery after 1995
   - Slow-growing coral: The model fails to capture the fluctuations in historical data

2. Ecological processes that need improvement:
   - The model lacks a density-dependent outbreak mechanism for COTS
   - The current implementation doesn't adequately capture the boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS outbreaks
   - The relationship between coral cover and COTS population dynamics needs strengthening

## Proposed Improvement: Allee Effect and Enhanced Outbreak Dynamics

I'm implementing an Allee effect for COTS population dynamics to better capture outbreak behavior. The Allee effect creates a threshold-dependent population growth where:
- At low densities, population growth is limited (difficult to find mates)
- At medium densities, population growth accelerates (outbreak conditions)
- At high densities, growth is limited by carrying capacity

This modification better represents the ecological reality of COTS outbreaks where:
1. Populations remain low until conditions are favorable
2. Once a critical density is reached, rapid population growth occurs (positive feedback)
3. The population eventually crashes due to resource depletion

Additionally, I've implemented a smooth outbreak mechanism using sigmoid functions that increases population growth when both COTS density and coral cover reach critical thresholds. This represents the ecological understanding that outbreaks occur when conditions are favorable (abundant food) and population density is sufficient for successful reproduction.

The model now includes:
1. A simplified Allee effect (cots_pred / (allee_threshold + cots_pred)) that reduces growth at low densities
2. A smooth outbreak amplifier using sigmoid functions that increases growth when both COTS density and coral cover exceed thresholds
3. A coral-dependent carrying capacity that creates feedback between coral abundance and COTS population

These changes maintain ecological realism while improving numerical stability, which should help the model better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks. The use of smooth sigmoid functions instead of conditional statements ensures proper gradient evaluation during optimization.

I've further simplified the mathematical expressions to improve numerical stability while preserving the ecological mechanisms. This includes:
- Using simpler forms of the temperature effect calculation
- Ensuring all denominators have a small constant to prevent division by zero
- Using standard conditional operators instead of CppAD functions for better compatibility
