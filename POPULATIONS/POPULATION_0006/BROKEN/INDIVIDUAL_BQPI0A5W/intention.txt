This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model focuses on capturing the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks and their selective predation on different coral functional groups.

Key ecological processes included:
1. COTS population dynamics with density-dependent growth and mortality
2. Differential predation by COTS on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) corals
3. Coral growth and recovery dynamics with competition between coral types
4. Environmental triggers for COTS outbreaks, particularly sea surface temperature effects on larval survival
5. Immigration of COTS larvae as an external driver of outbreaks
6. Feedback mechanisms between coral cover and COTS population dynamics

The model uses time series data of COTS abundance, coral cover (fast and slow-growing types), sea surface temperature, and COTS larval immigration to calibrate parameters and predict outbreak dynamics. Special attention is given to capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions, which is critical for reef management and conservation efforts.
