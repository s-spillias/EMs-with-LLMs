Model Assessment:
The current model captures some key dynamics of the COTS-coral system but has significant limitations. The model overestimates COTS outbreaks (1990-1995) compared to historical data, suggesting missing control mechanisms. While it includes temperature effects on COTS reproduction and coral-dependent COTS survival, it lacks density-dependent predation pressure that would naturally limit COTS population explosions.

Proposed Improvement:
I'm adding a density-dependent predation term to the COTS population dynamics. This represents how natural predators (e.g., giant triton snails, certain fish species) respond functionally to COTS abundance - as COTS density increases, predation pressure increases non-linearly. This is ecologically justified as:

1. Natural predators of COTS are known to exist but were historically depleted on many reefs
2. Predator functional responses typically show non-linear relationships with prey density
3. Predation is a key top-down control mechanism in marine ecosystems

The mathematical implementation uses a Type III functional response (sigmoidal) where predation is low at small COTS densities but increases rapidly above a threshold, representing predator switching behavior and aggregation responses. This addition should help control unrealistic COTS outbreaks while maintaining the possibility of outbreaks when conditions are favorable.

This improvement directly addresses the project context by providing a more realistic mechanism for limiting COTS outbreaks without eliminating the boom-bust dynamics that characterize this system.
