# Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

## Current Model Assessment

1. **Model Fit Analysis**:
   - The slow_pred comparison shows the model fails to capture the high variability in historical data, especially the sharp peaks around 1990-1992 and the subsequent decline.
   - The fast_pred comparison shows the model overestimates fast-growing coral cover after 1995, missing the dramatic decline in historical values.
   - The cots_pred comparison shows the model completely misses the major outbreak peaks around 1990 and 1994, suggesting a fundamental issue in capturing outbreak dynamics.

2. **Project Context Alignment**:
   - The current model does not effectively capture the "boom-bust cycles" of COTS outbreaks mentioned in the project context.
   - The timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions are not accurately represented.
   - The selective predation effects on different coral types are implemented but not producing realistic dynamics.

3. **Missing or Oversimplified Ecological Processes**:
   - The model lacks a mechanism for outbreak initiation beyond simple temperature effects and immigration.
   - There's no representation of critical ecological thresholds that might trigger rapid population growth.
   - The model doesn't account for potential Allee effects or other density-dependent processes that could influence outbreak dynamics.
   - Larval survival and recruitment processes, which are critical for COTS outbreak formation, are oversimplified.

## Proposed Improvement: Enhanced Larval Survival and Recruitment Dynamics

I propose implementing a more sophisticated representation of COTS larval survival and recruitment that includes:

1. **Phytoplankton-dependent recruitment success**: COTS outbreaks are strongly linked to phytoplankton availability for larvae, which is often associated with nutrient runoff events.

2. **Threshold-based recruitment dynamics**: Incorporate a non-linear response where recruitment success increases dramatically above certain phytoplankton/nutrient thresholds.

3. **Temporal lag effects**: Include a delayed response between environmental conditions and population impacts to represent the time between larval development and adult emergence.

This improvement directly addresses the project's focus on "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events" by implementing a more realistic representation of the ecological processes known to drive COTS outbreaks. The mathematical implementation will use a sigmoidal response function to represent the threshold-dependent nature of recruitment success, combined with a lagged effect to capture the temporal dynamics of outbreak formation.
