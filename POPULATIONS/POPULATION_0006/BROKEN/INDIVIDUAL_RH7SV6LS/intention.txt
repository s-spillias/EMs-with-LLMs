Model Assessment:
The current model doesn't adequately capture the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS). The historical data shows sharp peaks in COTS abundance around 1990-1992, but the model predictions smooth over these outbreaks, producing more gradual changes. Similarly, the model doesn't capture the corresponding rapid declines in coral cover during COTS outbreaks.

Ecological Improvement:
I've implemented a density-dependent predation mechanism on COTS with a threshold effect. This represents how natural predators (like giant triton snails, certain fish species, and shrimp) can effectively control COTS populations when they're at low densities, but once COTS exceed a critical threshold, they escape predator control, allowing for population explosions.

Mathematical Implementation:
The predation rate on COTS is modeled as:
pred_rate = pred_max * (1 - 1/(1 + exp(-steep_factor * (cots_t0 - pred_threshold))))

Where:
- pred_max: Maximum predation rate on COTS
- steep_factor: Controls how quickly predation changes around the threshold
- pred_threshold: COTS density at which predation effectiveness begins to decline

This sigmoidal function creates a threshold effect where:
- At low COTS densities (below threshold): Predation is effective, keeping COTS in check
- At high COTS densities (above threshold): Predation becomes ineffective, allowing outbreaks

This mechanism is ecologically justified by field observations showing that COTS outbreaks often occur when populations exceed certain thresholds, after which natural predators cannot control their numbers. The threshold effect creates the potential for rapid population increases once COTS escape predator control, better capturing the boom-bust dynamics observed in the historical data.
