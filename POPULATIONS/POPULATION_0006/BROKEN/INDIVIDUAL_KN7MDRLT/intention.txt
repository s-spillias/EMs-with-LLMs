This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks by incorporating:

1. Temperature-dependent COTS reproduction and survival
2. Larval immigration as an external trigger for outbreaks
3. Density-dependent predation on coral communities
4. Differential impacts on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) corals
5. Coral recovery dynamics with competition between coral types
6. Feedback mechanisms where coral availability limits COTS population growth

The model uses time series data of sea surface temperature, COTS larval immigration, adult COTS abundance, and coral cover percentages to calibrate parameters. It employs functional responses that reflect biological realities, such as Type II functional responses for COTS predation on corals and temperature-dependent reproduction rates. The model aims to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, providing insights for reef management strategies.
