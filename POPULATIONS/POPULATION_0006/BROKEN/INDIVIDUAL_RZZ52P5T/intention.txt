Model Assessment:
The current model fails to capture the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) populations. The historical data shows sharp peaks in COTS abundance around 1990-1991 and 1994, which the model smooths out. Similarly, the model doesn't adequately capture the corresponding impacts on coral cover, particularly the rapid declines following COTS outbreaks.

Ecological Improvement:
I've implemented two key ecological mechanisms to better capture COTS outbreak dynamics:

1. Allee effect in COTS reproduction: COTS experience positive density dependence at low-to-moderate densities due to increased fertilization success when adults are in proximity. This creates a threshold effect where population growth accelerates once a critical density is reached.

2. Density-dependent predation escape: Natural predators of COTS (e.g., Triton's trumpet, certain fish species) become saturated at high COTS densities, allowing the COTS population to temporarily escape predation control. This is implemented as a sigmoid function where predation pressure decreases as COTS density increases beyond a threshold.

These mechanisms work together to create the characteristic boom-bust cycles observed in COTS populations. The Allee effect helps trigger rapid population growth once a threshold is crossed, while predator satiation allows this growth to continue unchecked until resource limitation or other factors cause the population to crash.

The mathematical implementation uses sigmoid functions to create smooth transitions between different population states, which is both biologically realistic and numerically stable.
