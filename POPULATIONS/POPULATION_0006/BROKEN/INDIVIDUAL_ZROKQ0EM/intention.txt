This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral reef ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks by incorporating:

1. Temperature-dependent larval recruitment and survival
2. Density-dependent COTS population growth
3. Differential predation on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) coral species
4. Coral recovery dynamics with competition between coral types
5. Environmental triggers for COTS outbreaks, particularly sea surface temperature anomalies

The model uses a system of coupled differential equations discretized to an annual time step, with parameters estimated from time series data. Key mechanisms include:
- COTS larval immigration as an external forcing variable
- Coral cover as a limiting resource for COTS population growth
- Feedback between coral depletion and COTS mortality
- Different recovery rates for fast vs. slow-growing coral species

This model aims to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks to support management interventions on the Great Barrier Reef.
