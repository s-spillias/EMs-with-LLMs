This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impacts on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks through several key mechanisms:

1. COTS population dynamics: The model tracks adult COTS abundance, incorporating density-dependent reproduction, natural mortality, and larval immigration.

2. Coral community dynamics: Two functional groups of corals are modeled - fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) corals. Each has distinct growth rates, carrying capacities, and vulnerability to COTS predation.

3. Environmental triggers: Sea surface temperature (SST) influences both coral growth and COTS reproduction, serving as a potential trigger for outbreaks.

4. Predation dynamics: COTS preferentially feed on fast-growing corals but switch to slow-growing corals as preferred resources become depleted, using a modified multi-species functional response.

5. Feedback mechanisms: The model incorporates feedback loops where coral availability limits COTS population growth through reduced reproduction when food is scarce.

The model aims to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks while accounting for their selective impacts on coral communities. It can be used to explore management interventions and climate change scenarios affecting the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem.
