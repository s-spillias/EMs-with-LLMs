# Model Assessment and Improvement

## Current Model Assessment
1. **Data Fit Analysis**:
   - The model poorly captures the dynamics of both coral types (fast and slow-growing)
   - For slow-growing coral, the model predicts a constant value (~40%) while historical data shows a declining trend from ~15% to ~5%
   - For fast-growing coral, the model predicts a constant value (~60%) while historical data shows high variability (5-45%)
   - COTS predictions show some cyclical patterns but don't match the timing or magnitude of historical outbreaks

2. **Project Context Alignment**:
   - The model fails to capture the boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks
   - It doesn't adequately represent the selective predation effects on coral communities
   - The timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions are not accurately represented

3. **Missing/Oversimplified Ecological Processes**:
   - Larval development and recruitment dynamics of COTS are oversimplified
   - Coral recovery after predation events lacks realistic time lags
   - Predator-prey feedback mechanisms are too simplistic
   - Environmental triggers for outbreaks beyond temperature are missing
   - No representation of spatial dynamics or connectivity between reef sections

## Proposed Improvement: Delayed Recruitment and Outbreak Threshold Mechanism

I'm implementing a delayed recruitment mechanism with an outbreak threshold to better capture the boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations. This improvement addresses:

1. **Ecological Justification**: COTS outbreaks often follow a pattern where favorable conditions lead to successful larval development, but there's a time lag between larval production and when juveniles grow large enough to cause significant coral predation. Additionally, outbreaks tend to occur when populations exceed certain thresholds.

2. **Mathematical Approach**: 
   - Adding a delayed recruitment term that incorporates previous years' reproduction
   - Implementing a threshold-based outbreak mechanism where predation rates increase non-linearly when COTS density exceeds critical values
   - Including density-dependent mortality at high COTS densities to capture population crashes

This improvement should better capture the episodic nature of COTS outbreaks while maintaining model parsimony. The delayed recruitment represents the time lag between favorable reproduction conditions and the appearance of adult COTS, while the threshold mechanism captures the non-linear dynamics of outbreak initiation and collapse.

## Implementation Notes

The model has been drastically simplified to ensure numerical stability while preserving the core ecological mechanisms:

1. **Fixed Parameter Values**: Using hardcoded values for many parameters to eliminate potential sources of numerical instability during parameter estimation.

2. **Binary Threshold Effects**: Implementing simple binary (on/off) responses for temperature effects and outbreak behavior instead of continuous functions.

3. **Simplified Functional Responses**: Using basic functional forms for predation and growth that maintain essential ecological relationships but are numerically robust.

4. **Independent Predation Terms**: Separating the predation terms for fast and slow-growing coral to reduce interdependencies that could cause gradient evaluation issues.

5. **Fixed Observation Error**: Using a constant observation error term to eliminate another potential source of instability.

This highly simplified model maintains the two key ecological improvements - delayed recruitment and outbreak thresholds - while ensuring the model can be fitted to data without numerical issues. Once this basic structure is working, the model can be gradually refined to incorporate more realistic parameter values and functional forms.
