This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral reef ecosystems in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks while accounting for their selective predation on different coral functional groups.

Key ecological processes included:
1. Temperature-dependent COTS reproduction and development
2. Larval immigration as an outbreak trigger mechanism
3. Density-dependent COTS mortality
4. Selective predation on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) corals
5. Differential coral growth and recovery rates
6. Feedback mechanisms between coral cover and COTS population dynamics

The model uses a system of coupled differential equations discretized to an annual time step, with parameters estimated from time series data. Environmental forcing (sea surface temperature) and larval immigration are included as external drivers that can trigger and sustain outbreak events. The model aims to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, providing insights for reef management strategies.
