Goal: Predict episodic Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef by coupling COTS population dynamics to fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) coral functional groups, with environmental forcing by sea-surface temperature (SST) and exogenous larval immigration.

Ecological functioning:
- COTS population boom-bust: Adult abundance increases rapidly when (i) food is abundant (especially Acropora), (ii) temperatures are near an optimal range for reproduction/survival, and (iii) larval supply pulses occur. Busts follow from resource depletion, background mortality, and adverse temperatures.
- Consumerâ€“resource coupling: COTS consumes corals via a multi-prey Holling Type II functional response with preference for fast-growing corals. Coral losses from predation feed back positively to COTS recruitment via conversion efficiency but negatively via reduced carrying capacity when food becomes scarce.
- Coral dynamics: Each coral group grows logistically with interspecific competition for benthic space and suffers temperature-driven bleaching mortality that increases smoothly as SST exceeds a bleaching threshold. Predation from COTS reduces cover, and Acropora responds faster than slow corals.
- Outbreak triggers and sustainment: Outbreaks are triggered and amplified by (a) temperature-modified vital rates, (b) saturating food availability effects on COTS reproduction, (c) an Allee-like smooth low-density limitation on COTS reproduction, and (d) larval immigration pulses modified by temperature and food availability.
- Environmental modifiers: SST modifies COTS reproduction (Gaussian thermal response around an optimum) and coral bleaching (logistic ramp above threshold). Immigration is modulated by temperature and food conditions to reflect variable settlement/survival.

Numerical and statistical approach:
- State updates are annual, using only lagged (previous-year) state values to avoid data leakage.
- Smooth saturating and logistic functions avoid hard thresholds; small constants prevent division by zero.
- Parameters are softly bounded with smooth penalties within biologically plausible ranges.
- Likelihood: lognormal errors for strictly positive COTS abundance; beta likelihoods for proportional coral covers (observations and predictions mapped to (0,1) with a small epsilon). Minimum observation uncertainty is enforced smoothly.
