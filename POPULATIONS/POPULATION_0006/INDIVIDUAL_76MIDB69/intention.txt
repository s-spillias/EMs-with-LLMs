This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks while accounting for their selective predation on different coral functional groups.

Key ecological processes included:
1. COTS population dynamics with density-dependent mortality and recruitment influenced by sea surface temperature
2. Differential predation by COTS on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) corals
3. Coral growth and recovery dynamics with competition between coral functional groups
4. Environmental forcing through sea surface temperature effects on COTS recruitment and coral mortality
5. Episodic COTS larval immigration events that can trigger outbreaks

The model uses a system of coupled differential equations discretized to an annual time step, with parameters estimated from time series data. Functional responses include saturating predation rates, temperature-dependent recruitment, and density-dependent mortality. The model aims to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks and their cascading effects on coral community composition.
