This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks while accounting for their selective predation on different coral types.

Key ecological processes included:
1. COTS population dynamics with density-dependent mortality and recruitment influenced by sea surface temperature
2. Differential predation by COTS on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) corals
3. Coral growth and recovery dynamics with different intrinsic rates for fast and slow-growing species
4. Environmental triggers for COTS outbreaks, including larval immigration and temperature effects
5. Feedback mechanisms between coral cover and COTS survival

The model uses time series data of sea surface temperature and COTS larval immigration as forcing variables, and predicts COTS abundance and coral cover percentages for both coral functional groups. Parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood with appropriate error structures for each response variable.
