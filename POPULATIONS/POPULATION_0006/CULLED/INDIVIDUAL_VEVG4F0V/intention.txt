Purpose: Predict episodic outbreaks (boom–bust cycles) of adult Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS; ind m^-2) and their impacts on two coral functional groups on the Great Barrier Reef: fast-growing Acropora (%) and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites (%). The model is annual and mechanistic, designed for forecasting from initial conditions and environmental/immigration forcings.

Core processes:
- Coral growth: Logistic growth with shared substrate capacity and inter-group competition, modified by SST-driven bleaching mortality (smooth sigmoid around a thermal threshold). 
- COTS feeding: Multi-prey Holling type II functional response with preference/handling time, producing selective predation (stronger on Acropora) and saturating consumption at high coral cover.
- COTS population dynamics: Adult updates include (i) recruitment from adult reproduction with an Allee effect (smooth mate-finding) and temperature performance curve, (ii) additional settlement via larval immigration, and (iii) mortality comprising baseline, density-dependent, and starvation/crash components that increase smoothly when total coral cover is low.
- Feedbacks: Coral depletion reduces COTS food/condition and elevates starvation/crash mortality, while high COTS densities increase coral loss—generating self-limiting booms followed by busts.
- Environmental modifiers: SST controls coral bleaching risk and modifies COTS reproductive performance via a Gaussian temperature response centered on an optimal temperature.

Numerical choices:
- Smooth saturations and sigmoids replace hard thresholds; small constants avoid division by zero.
- All predictions are forward-simulated from observed initial states (t=0) using only lagged drivers (t-1) to avoid data leakage.
- Observation models: lognormal for positive COTS density; beta for coral proportions; weak-normal for forcing series to incorporate all observations in the likelihood.

Outputs:
- Predicted time series: cots_pred, fast_pred, slow_pred (plus sst_pred, cotsimm_pred for forcing). These capture timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks and associated coral trajectories.
