Assessment of current model and rationale for improvement

Fit evaluation
- Quantitative evaluation requires the residuals file referenced in the brief, but it was not included here. Please provide it so I can examine temporal patterns (autocorrelation, skewness, outliers) and determine whether dynamics lag the data, over/under-shoot outbreak peaks, or mis-time declines.

Alignment with project context
- The model includes key mechanisms for COTS–coral dynamics:
  - COTS vital rates modulated by temperature (Gaussian around Topt_COTS) and food saturation (f_food).
  - An Allee effect on reproduction at low density (s_Allee).
  - Prey-specific, saturating predation via multi-prey Holling Type II functional response with handling times (aF,aS,hF,hS).
  - Coral competition (alpha_FS, alpha_SF), logistic growth with shared benthic capacity (Kb), and bleaching mortality as a smooth ramp.
  - External larval immigration modulated by environment (s_imm with f_temp and f_food).

- Limitation relative to outbreak dynamics:
  - The conversion of consumed coral into adult COTS is immediate and linear: eC*(gF+gS) enters the adult update in the same time step. Empirically, outbreaks are recruitment-driven with delays (larval → juvenile → adult), not instantaneous adult gains from feeding. This can blur peaks and reduce the characteristic boom–bust timing.

Key ecological process missing/oversimplified
- Missing maturation delay from consumption-derived energy to adult recruitment. A simple one-year delay better reflects the life cycle and commonly produces stronger, more realistic outbreak pulses while preserving the model’s parsimony.

Chosen improvement: delayed recruitment buffer
- Introduce a one-year buffer cons_buf that stores eC*(gF+gS) computed from t−1 states. A fraction tau_mature (0–1) of the previous year’s buffer is added to adults this year.
- This preserves the existing mechanistic structure (temperature, food saturation, immigration, Allee effect, predation on corals) and adds a minimal additional parameter while strengthening outbreak timing.

Updated equations (t indexes years; all drivers/states use t−1 in updates)
- Compute predation consumption (unchanged):
  gF_{t-1} = aF * C_{t-1} * F_{t-1} / (1 + aF*hF*F_{t-1} + aS*hS*S_{t-1})
  gS_{t-1} = aS * C_{t-1} * S_{t-1} / (1 + aF*hF*F_{t-1} + aS*hS*S_{t-1})

- Recruitment buffer:
  cons_buf_t = eC * (gF_{t-1} + gS_{t-1})

- Adult COTS update (modified):
  C_t = C_{t-1}
        + rC * f_temp_{t-1} * s_Allee_{t-1} * f_food_{t-1} * C_{t-1} * (1 - C_{t-1}/K_eff_{t-1})
        + tau_mature * cons_buf_{t-1}
        - mC * C_{t-1}
        + s_imm * IMM_{t-1} * f_temp_{t-1} * f_food_{t-1}

- Coral updates and all other components remain unchanged. No current-time observations are used in process equations.

Parameter updates
- New parameter: tau_mature (dimensionless, [0,1]). Ecologically, this aggregates larval survival, settlement, and one-year maturation into the adult population from the consumption-derived recruitment pool. Bounds reflect a per-year fraction.
- eC description updated to clarify conversion into the recruitment buffer (not immediate adult increment).

Next steps once residuals are available
- Check for lagged residual autocorrelation in COTS peaks; the added delay should reduce systematic timing errors.
- Examine coral residuals for overpredicted losses at low cover (if present, consider adding predator interference in the functional response as a future incremental refinement, e.g., Beddington–DeAngelis term).
