Assessment of current model (before change)
1) Fit to data:
- Residuals file was not provided in this context. The below assessment relies on model structure and expected patterns in similar systems. Please share residual diagnostics to refine conclusions.
- The process model is well-posed and numerically stable (softplus, logit updates, minimum SDs). However, immediate conversion of larval production into adults within a single year likely causes predicted adult peaks to be too synchronous with environmental triggers and immigration, potentially misaligning with observed outbreak timing (typically delayed by 1–3 years due to juvenile stages).
- Immigration currently adds directly to adults rather than to the larval/settlement pool. This can cause unrealistically abrupt adult spikes and degrade fit when observations show lagged increases.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Strengths: Includes temperature-triggered recruitment (S_env), food-limited fecundity (Monod via coral cover composition), COTS predation on fast/slow corals via multi-prey Holling II, coral bleaching impacts on growth, and temperature-dependent adult mortality. These are key mechanisms for boom-bust dynamics.
- Gaps: The model lacks explicit juvenile maturation delay. Crown-of-thorns have a prolonged juvenile phase (months to years), with an herbivorous stage followed by a shift to corallivory before adulthood. This delay is central to episodic outbreak timing and wave propagation along the GBR.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes:
- Missing juvenile dynamics and maturation delay (most critical for outbreak timing).
- Immigration routed to adults instead of recruits (structural mismatch with process meaning).
- Adult food-dependent mortality is not included; this can accentuate busts but is secondary to the maturation delay.
- Age/size structure is otherwise lumped; predation attributed only to adults (acceptable simplification here).

Parameter review:
- Many parameters are tagged as “initial estimate,” with some sourced from literature (e.g., c_max, selectivity q_fast/q_slow, coral growth rates). No entries are flagged as newly updated from recent literature searches in the provided file.
- Given ecological evidence, the original equation mapping recruits and immigration directly to adults is not appropriate. A maturation delay is biologically warranted without requiring reinterpretation of existing parameter magnitudes.

Chosen improvement: Add a juvenile maturation delay and correctly route immigration into the recruit pool
Rationale:
- Ecological: COTS take ~1–3 years to reach reproductive adult sizes, and subadult stages can be cryptic. Outbreaks therefore exhibit a lag between favorable larval conditions and adult spikes. A two-compartment juvenile pipeline (Erlang-2) provides a realistic, smooth discrete-time delay and is standard for approximating gamma/Erlang maturation times.
- Modeling: The linear-chain trick adds minimal complexity, avoids unstable discrete lags, and is differentiable for TMB. It addresses timing/magnitude of peaks by delaying and smoothing the pulse of larvae into adulthood.
- Structural fix: Routing immigration to the juvenile inflow reflects its biological meaning (larval immigration), avoiding unrealistic direct adult additions.

What changed (summary):
- Introduced two juvenile state variables J1 and J2 and a maturation chain:
  • Inflow to juveniles R_in = e_conv * (R_BH + imm_eff * cotsimm).
  • Juveniles survive each year with probability sJ (logit parameterization for stability) and transition between compartments at rate mu = 2 / tau_juv.
  • Adults gain M_t = mu * (sJ * J2 + flow from J1) rather than immediate recruit conversion.
- Adults now update as A_t = softplus(A_{t-1} * survival + M_t), preserving previous non-negativity treatment.
- Coral dynamics and observation models unchanged; predation remains per adult only to avoid overcomplication.

New/modified parameters:
- tau_juv (years): Mean time to maturity (bounds 0.5–5 y). Center initial value at 2 y (consistent with many field observations).
- s_juv_logit (logit scale): Juvenile annual survival mapped to (0,1) via logistic; initial value logit(0.8) ≈ 1.386. Bound on logit scale [-5, 5] (~survival in [~0.0067, ~0.993]).
- e_conv: Clarified to represent conversion from recruits (incl. immigration) to juvenile stage 1.

Expected effects:
- Outbreak timing: Introduces realistic 1–3 year lag from favorable SST/food pulses to adult outbreaks.
- Magnitude/duration: Spreads recruitment pulses, reducing unrealistically sharp adult spikes from immigration; supports boom-bust cycles with sharper busts once coral declines and adult mortality increases.
- Identifiability: The two added parameters are interpretable and should be estimable with adult and coral time series, especially if residuals show lag structure.

Notes and future considerations (not implemented here to keep one focused improvement):
- Consider adding food-dependent adult mortality to sharpen busts if residuals indicate prolonged high adult plateaus under low coral cover.
- If residuals show subadult predation signatures, allow a small fraction of J2 to contribute to consumption.

Data leakage constraint:
- No current time-step observations are used in prediction updates. Initial conditions remain anchored at t=0 to observed values, consistent with the pre-existing approach.

Action items:
- Please provide the residuals/diagnostics file so we can verify whether lag structure is improved and whether additional refinements (e.g., food-dependent mortality) are warranted.
