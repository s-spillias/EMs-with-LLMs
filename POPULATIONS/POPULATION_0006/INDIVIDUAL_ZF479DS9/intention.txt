This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral reef ecosystems in the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks while accounting for their selective predation on different coral functional groups.

Key ecological processes included:
1. Temperature-dependent COTS reproduction and larval survival
2. Density-dependent COTS mortality
3. Differential predation rates on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae and Porites spp.) corals
4. Coral growth with resource limitation and competition
5. External larval immigration as an outbreak trigger mechanism
6. Feedback loops between coral cover and COTS population dynamics

The model uses a discrete-time approach with annual time steps, incorporating both direct effects (predation) and indirect effects (resource limitation, environmental drivers). Sea surface temperature (SST) is included as an environmental driver that can modify COTS reproduction rates and potentially trigger outbreaks when exceeding threshold values. The model is designed to predict COTS abundance and coral cover dynamics, with special attention to capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS population explosions.
