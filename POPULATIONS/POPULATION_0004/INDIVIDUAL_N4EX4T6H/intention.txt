The current model effectively captures the basic boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks through a threshold‐dependent logistic trigger. However, it relies solely on COTS population levels to trigger outbreaks, without explicitly accounting for resource limitations via coral availability. Since coral cover (both fast- and slow-growing) is critical in sustaining COTS outbreaks, neglecting this may lead to overestimation of outbreak intensity when coral is scarce.

To improve ecological realism, the outbreak-induced growth term is now modulated by a coral availability factor computed as the average of fast and slow coral cover from the previous time step. The new parameter `rho` scales this effect. This improvement is ecologically justified: outbreaks should be more pronounced when abundant prey (coral) is available and attenuate when coral cover is low.
