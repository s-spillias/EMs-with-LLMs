Assessment:
The current model uses a logistic growth modulated by an additive environmental effect based on
sea surface temperature (SST) and larval immigration. However, this simple additive approach may
fail to capture the threshold‐triggered dynamics leading to rapid outbreak “booms” observed in COTS.
To better represent the ecological processes, I have introduced a non‐linear environmental boost
mechanism. Specifically, when the combined environmental signal (SST + larval immigration) exceeds
a tuned threshold (env_threshold), an additional growth boost (env_boost) is applied. This mechanism
represents the sudden amplification of growth when favourable conditions trigger outbreak events.
All changes ensure that only previous time step values are used in predictions to avoid data leakage.
