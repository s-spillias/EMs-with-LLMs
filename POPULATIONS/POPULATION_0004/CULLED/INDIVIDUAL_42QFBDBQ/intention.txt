Assessment:
The current model captures the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks reasonably well; however, residual analysis reveals systematic patterns indicating that the linear predation term may be oversimplified. 

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a saturation parameter "alpha" in the COTS predation term. This change implements a Michaelis–Menten type modification whereby the impact of predation on coral is divided by (1 + alpha × coral abundance). Ecologically, this reflects that predatory efficiency saturates at high coral densities, thereby preventing an unrealistically high predation rate and better capturing the observed boom-bust cycles.
