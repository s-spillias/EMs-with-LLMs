This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef by capturing the characteristic boom‐bust cycles seen during outbreaks. It integrates multiple resource limitation mechanisms—including saturating functions and threshold effects—and accounts for environmental modifications, selective predation on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites spp.) coral communities, and feedback loops between ecological components. The model updates predictions using only the previous time step’s state variables to avoid data leakage, while numerical stability is maintained using small constants and smooth transitions in functional forms.
