Assessment:
- The current model captures basic outbreak dynamics but uses a linear coral resource factor, which oversimplifies resource limitation.
- Improvement: Introduce a saturating (Michaelisâ€“Menten) functional response for coral resource uptake by COTS.
- The new parameter "resource_half" represents the half-saturation constant, which better captures diminishing returns in resource availability as coral cover increases.
