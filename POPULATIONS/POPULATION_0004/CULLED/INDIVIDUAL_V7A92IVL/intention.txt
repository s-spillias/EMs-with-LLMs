Assessment:
The current model moderately fits the observed data, but the residuals suggest that incorporating resource limitation mechanisms could enhance the realism of the outbreak dynamics. The chosen improvement is to modify the logistic growth term by incorporating a saturating factor based on total coral cover (fast + slow). Ecologically, this reflects that abundant coral provides more resources for COTS, supporting rapid growth; however, when coral is depleted, resource limitations constrain further outbreak expansion.
