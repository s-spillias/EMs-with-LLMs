Assessment:
1. The current model captures the boomâ€“bust cycles of COTS but does not explicitly incorporate the impact of coral resource availability on sustaining outbreak events.
2. Residuals indicate that during periods of low coral cover the model tends to overestimate COTS growth, suggesting that resource limitation effects are oversimplified.
Chosen improvement:
- Introduce a resource limitation mechanism by computing a resource_factor based on the sum of previous time step coral covers (fast_pred and slow_pred), normalized by the initial total coral cover (fast0 + slow0).
- This factor scales the intrinsic COTS growth rate so that higher coral availability promotes outbreak growth, whereas depleted coral resources dampen COTS reproduction.
Change:
- In model.cpp, compute resource_factor as (fast_pred(t-1) + slow_pred(t-1)) / (fast0 + slow0) and multiply the intrinsic COTS growth term by resource_factor.
  This implementation uses only lagged predictions to avoid data leakage.
