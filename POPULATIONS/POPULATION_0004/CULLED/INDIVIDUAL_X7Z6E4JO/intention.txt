Assessment and Rationale:
1. The current model fits data moderately well, but residuals reveal systematic overshoots during outbreak events. This suggests missing density‐dependent self‐limitation.
2. While the outbreak trigger and coral predation are well-captured, the model lacks a mechanism that curbs COTS over-proliferation when densities become very high.
3. To improve realism, a new quadratic mortality term (modeling effects such as cannibalism, disease, or resource depletion) is added to the COTS dynamics. This term enhances the boom-bust behavior by imposing stronger density‐dependent mortality during outbreaks.
