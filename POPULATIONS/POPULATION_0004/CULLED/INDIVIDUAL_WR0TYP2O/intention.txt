Assessment and Improvement:
The original model employs a binary outbreak factor, using a threshold to switch between two fixed growth multipliers. This approach oversimplifies the ecological process of outbreak onset. Given the project’s focus on capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of boom‐bust cycles, a gradual, continuous response is more realistic.
Our improvement replaces the binary outbreak factor with a logistic function. This new formulation provides a smooth transition between low and high outbreak regimes, controlled by a new parameter, `outbreak_sensitivity`. Ecologically, this better represents how increasing COTS abundance gradually overcomes natural regulatory mechanisms, triggering a pronounced outbreak.
