Assessment and Rationale:
The residual analysis indicated that while the model captures the timing of outbreaks, it tends to over‚Äêpredict the magnitude when COTS densities are very high. This suggests that an important limiting mechanism (resource limitation) is missing. 
Our improvement introduces a new parameter K_resource, representing the resource-driven carrying capacity that diminishes outbreak intensity when COTS numbers become very high. Ecologically, even during outbreaks, available resources (prey, habitat) can restrict further population explosion. This modification adds realism by imposing a saturating effect on outbreak dynamics.
