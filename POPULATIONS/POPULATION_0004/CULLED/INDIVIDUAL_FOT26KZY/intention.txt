Assessment:
- The current model uses a fixed outbreak threshold based solely on COTS density. However, residual analysis suggests that variability in coral cover may help explain discrepancies between observed and predicted outbreak events.
- Ecologically, high coral cover provides abundant food for COTS, lowering the effective threshold for an outbreak. Incorporating a coral-modulated factor allows the model to dynamically adjust outbreak initiation.
Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce a new parameter "alpha" to modulate the outbreak threshold.
- New effective threshold: outbreak_threshold - alpha * (fast_pred + slow_pred)
- This change captures resource limitation effects and feedback from the coral community while keeping only lagged (previous time-step) values in the calculations.
