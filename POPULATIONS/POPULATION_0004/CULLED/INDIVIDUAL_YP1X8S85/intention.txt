Assessment:
1. Residual analysis indicates that the current model overpredicts the impact of COTS at outbreak peaks, suggesting that a linear predation term might be oversimplified.
2. While the model captures boom-bust cycles and selective coral predation, it omits the ecological reality that at high COTS densities, additional individuals have a diminishing marginal effect due to limitations in predator or resource availability.
3. To improve the ecological realism, a saturating functional response is introduced in the COTS dynamic equation by dividing the predation impact by (1 + beta * COTS).
4. A new parameter, "beta", is added (with value 0.01 by default) to represent the saturation constant for the predation impact.
5. The modification strictly uses lagged values to avoid data leakage.
