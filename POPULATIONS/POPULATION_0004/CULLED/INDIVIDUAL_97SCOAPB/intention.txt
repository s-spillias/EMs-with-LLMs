Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model fits the observed COTS and coral data reasonably well, yet residual analysis reveals systematic deviations—particularly in the coral dynamics during outbreak periods. The logistic function used for predation on coral may overestimate losses at very high COTS abundances.
To address this, we are implementing a Michaelis–Menten (saturating) predation term, which is ecologically justified because predation rates often plateau at high prey densities. This modification introduces two new parameters, H_fast and H_slow, representing the half‐saturation constants for fast‐ and slow-growing coral respectively. These parameters capture the density of COTS at which predation effects reach half of their maximum value, thus improving the model's ability to predict boom–bust cycles in coral cover.
