Assessment and Rationale:

Based on the model performance and residual analyses, we observe that the current linear predation term on coral may oversimplify the ecological dynamics. In reality, as coral cover increases, predation efficiency is expected to saturate due to factors such as handling time and limited predator capacity. To capture these dynamics more realistically, we introduce a saturation mechanism in the COTS predation term by adding the new parameter "alpha_pred". This parameter models a Michaelisâ€“Menten-like response, ensuring that predation losses on coral do not scale linearly at high coral densities. This improvement better reflects the complex feedbacks in the system and is expected to enhance the model's ability to predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks.
