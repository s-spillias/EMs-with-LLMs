Assessment:
The current model effectively uses a logistic trigger for outbreak events based solely on past COTS abundance. However, ecological data indicate that coral cover (i.e. prey availability) plays a critical role in outbreak dynamics while its effect saturates at high levels. To address this, we introduce a resource limitation mechanism by incorporating a saturating resource factor based on the combined fast and slow coral covers. The new parameter "resource_half" represents the half‐saturation constant for this effect. This modification allows the outbreak growth (r1) to be modulated by available coral cover, thereby improving the realism of the boom‐bust dynamics.
