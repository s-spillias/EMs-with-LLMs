Assessment:
The model currently captures the essential boomâ€“bust cycle of COTS outbreaks but underestimates the rapid escalation observed during outbreak events. This is likely due to the linear formulation of the boom term, which does not fully capture the nonlinear feedback mechanisms (such as resource limitation or competitive release) that can accelerate COTS population growth once a threshold is exceeded.

Improvement:
This change introduces a new parameter, `outbreak_exponent`, that nonlinearly amplifies the boom phase by raising the previous COTS population to this exponent. This modification is expected to better represent the explosive growth seen in outbreaks while ensuring that predictions rely solely on previous time step data (preventing data leakage).

Ecological Justification:
Exceeding a COTS density threshold may trigger intensified feedback processes leading to faster-than-linear growth. The `outbreak_exponent` parameter quantifies this nonlinear acceleration, enabling improved modeling of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
