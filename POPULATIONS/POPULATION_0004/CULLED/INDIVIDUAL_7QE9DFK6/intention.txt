[Model Assessment and Improvement]
Assessment: The residuals indicate that the current model underestimates outbreak magnitude when fast-growing coral cover is high. The model does not adequately capture the feedback mechanism whereby abundant coral resources enhance COTS reproduction during outbreaks.
Improvement: Incorporate a resource dependence factor by including the previous fast-growing coral cover (normalized to 100) in both the logistic growth and outbreak boom terms. This change reinforces the ecological feedback: when coral cover is high, the outbreak dynamics (both logistic and explosive growth) are enhanced, better matching observed boom-bust cycles.
