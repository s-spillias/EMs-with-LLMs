This Template Model Builder (TMB) model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures boom‐bust dynamics where COTS populations quickly surge to outbreak levels and then crash, driven by resource limitation, environmental forcing, and selective predation on coral communities. It incorporates saturating functions, threshold effects, process‐specific efficiencies, and smooth transitions to ensure numerical stability. Feedback loops account for indirect effects on fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites corals.
