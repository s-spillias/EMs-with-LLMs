   The current model robustly captures outbreak dynamics but uses a linear predation term (γ * cots * (fast + slow)), which may oversimplify the real-world nonlinear feedbacks between COTS and coral cover. Residual analysis indicates systematic underestimation of COTS decline when coral cover is high. To better represent the “resource limitation” effect on predation       
   efficiency, we introduce a saturating functional form and a new parameter predation_half that denotes the coral cover level where predation efficiency is half its maximum. This Michaelis–Menten-like modification captures the ecological reality that predation does not increase indefinitely with coral cover.

 The current model captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks well, but it employs a linear predation term that may not fully represent the ecological feedbacks between COTS and coral cover. Residual analysis indicates that the model tends to underestimate COTS declines when coral cover is high.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 To address this, we introduce a resource limitation mechanism via a saturating (Michaelis–Menten type) predation response. A new parameter, "predation_half", has been added to represent the coral cover level at which predation efficiency reaches half its maximum value. This modification limits the predation effect at high coral cover, capturing a more realistic nonlinear 
 feedback consistent with ecological observations.
