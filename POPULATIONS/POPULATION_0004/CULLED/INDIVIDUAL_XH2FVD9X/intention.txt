Assessment:
The current model captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks well, but it employs a linear predation term that may not fully represent the ecological feedbacks between COTS and coral cover. Residual analysis indicates that the model tends to underestimate COTS declines when coral cover is high.

Improvement:
To address this, we introduce a resource limitation mechanism via a saturating (Michaelis–Menten type) predation response. A new parameter, "predation_half", has been added to represent the coral cover level at which predation efficiency reaches half its maximum value. This modification limits the predation effect at high coral cover, capturing a more realistic nonlinear feedback consistent with ecological observations.
