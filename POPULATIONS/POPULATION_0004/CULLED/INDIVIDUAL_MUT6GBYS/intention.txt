Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
1. The current model relies on logistic growth and outbreak indicators to simulate COTS dynamics.
2. However, it does not explicitly account for resource availability – i.e. the availability of coral, which is known to influence outbreak events.
3. To improve ecological realism, a new parameter "coral_availability_effect" is introduced to modulate logistic growth by the combined available coral cover (fast + slow), normalized by 200.
4. This indirect feedback mechanism represents resource limitation, ensuring that lower coral cover dampens outbreak growth, thereby better capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of boom‐bust cycles.
