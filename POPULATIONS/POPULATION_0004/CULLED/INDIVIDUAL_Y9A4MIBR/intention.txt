Assessment:
- Residual analysis indicates that while the current model captures boom‚Äêbust cycles reasonably well, it underestimates outbreak magnitudes during ecologically favorable periods.
- The model does not currently account for external environmental drivers, which can trigger or enhance outbreak events.

Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce an environmental modifier parameter, "env_modifier", to scale the logistic growth term.
- Ecological Rationale: This modifier represents variable environmental conditions (e.g., temperature anomalies, nutrient surges) that can trigger and sustain outbreaks, improving the timing, magnitude, and duration predictions.
