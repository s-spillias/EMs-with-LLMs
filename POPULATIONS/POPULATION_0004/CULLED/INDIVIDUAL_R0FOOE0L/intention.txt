Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
Residuals indicate that the model overpredicts coral recovery relative to observations. The current linear recovery term (coral_recovery * (100 - coral_prev)) does not account for environmental stressors that can limit regrowth. To better capture the burst-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their impact on coral communities, we have introduced a new parameter, "coral_env_modifier." This parameter scales the recovery rates for both fast- and slow-growing corals, enabling adjustment for environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, nutrient levels) that modulate recovery efficiency. This improvement adds ecological realism while still strictly using previous time step values in predictions.
