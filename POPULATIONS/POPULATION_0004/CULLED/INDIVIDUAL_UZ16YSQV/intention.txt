Assessment:
The current model shows systematic deviations between observed and predicted values during outbreak events. This indicates that the logistic outbreak trigger—based solely on the previous COTS density—is oversimplified and does not capture potential environmental influences.
To improve this, we introduce an environmental multiplier (env_mult), which modifies the effective COTS density in the outbreak trigger. This reflects the ecological reality that environmental conditions (e.g., water temperature, nutrient availability) can enhance or dampen outbreak events, better capturing the boom-bust dynamics observed in Crown-of-Thorns starfish populations.
