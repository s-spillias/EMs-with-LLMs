Assessment and reasoning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The current model fits the data moderately well overall but consistently under-/over-estimates COTS outbreak timing and magnitude. In particular, residuals indicate systematic deviations during outbreak events, suggesting that the simple logistic outbreak trigger (based solely on previous COTS density) may be oversimplified.                                                 
To better capture the boom‐bust cycles described in the PROJECT CONTEXT, we propose adding an environmental multiplier parameter (env_mult) that modifies the effective COTS density in the outbreak trigger. Ecologically, environmental conditions (such as water temperature, nutrient availability, etc.) are known to modulate outbreak events. By incorporating this mechanism,  
the model can better represent how favorable conditions may amplify outbreak intensity and timing while retaining the use of only lagged responses.

 The current model shows systematic deviations between observed and predicted values during outbreak events. This indicates that the logistic outbreak trigger—based solely on the previous COTS density—is oversimplified and does not capture potential environmental influences.                                                                                                    
 To improve this, we introduce an environmental multiplier (env_mult), which modifies the effective COTS density in the outbreak trigger. This reflects the ecological reality that environmental conditions (e.g., water temperature, nutrient availability) can enhance or dampen outbreak events, better capturing the boom-bust dynamics observed in Crown-of-Thorns starfish      
 populations.
