The model explores episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It simulates boom‐bust cycles where COTS populations rapidly surge and then crash, driven by intrinsic growth modified by an outbreak trigger. Outbreaks are modeled with a smooth logistic function that activates rapid growth once a threshold abundance is exceeded. The model also simulates selective predation on coral communities – with fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites corals being consumed at different rates – along with coral recovery processes. Feedbacks, resource limitations, and multiple environmental modifiers are incorporated to ensure realistic dynamics under different initial states and forcing conditions.
