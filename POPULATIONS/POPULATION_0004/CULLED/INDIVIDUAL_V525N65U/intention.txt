Assessment: The model captures boom-bust dynamics of COTS, but the residuals show that outbreak onsets are systematically under-predicted. Outbreak events in the ecosystem tend to occur very abruptly once a threshold is crossed. To better capture this nonlinear escalation, we introduce a nonlinearity parameter "eta" into the outbreak trigger. Higher values of eta sharpen the outbreak response, aligning model predictions more closely with observed rapid outbreak transitions.
