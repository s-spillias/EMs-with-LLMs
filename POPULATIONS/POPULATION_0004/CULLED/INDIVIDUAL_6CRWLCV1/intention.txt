Assessment:
- The current model fits the observed data reasonably well using a logistic outbreak trigger and density-dependent growth.
- However, the coral dynamic equations use a linear predation response that may oversimplify the ecological reality, especially at high COTS densities, where feeding efficiency is expected to saturate.

Chosen improvement:
- Introduce saturating predation responses on both fast and slow-growing corals by incorporating saturation parameters (beta_fast and beta_slow) into the equations.
- This modification reflects realistic feeding limitations (e.g., handling time) and better captures the characteristic boom-bust dynamics observed in COTS outbreaks.
