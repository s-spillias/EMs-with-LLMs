Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
--------------------------------------
1. The current model fits the data reasonably but often under/over-estimates outbreak timing and magnitude.
2. The model uses a logistic outbreak trigger modified by a power-law function of the average coral cover (using pow(coral_effect, rho)). This formulation may be too flexible and does not capture the ecological saturation in resource uptake.
3. To better represent the limited capacity of coral resources to sustain outbreak growth, I propose replacing the power-law representation with a Michaelis–Menten (saturating) function: coral_effect/(h_coral + coral_effect).
4. A new parameter, h_coral, is introduced to capture the half-saturation constant. This approach is ecologically justified and should improve the model’s ability to predict the characteristic boom-bust outbreak cycles.
