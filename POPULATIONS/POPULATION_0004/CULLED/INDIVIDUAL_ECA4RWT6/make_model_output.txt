 The residual analysis indicates that while the current model reproduces the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks, the linear formulation for the predation effect on COTS may overestimate predation at high coral cover. Ecologically, predator efficiency tends to saturate due to limitations such as handling time and resource processing capacity.                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, we introduce a saturating (Michaelis–Menten style) term for the predation effect. A new parameter "predation_saturation" is added to capture this nonlinear scaling so that as coral cover increases, the predation effect on COTS plateaus. This modification should improve how the model captures the mechanistic feedback during boom-bust cycles, consistent wi 
 the project context.
