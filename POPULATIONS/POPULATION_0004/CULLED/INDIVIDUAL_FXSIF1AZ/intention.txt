Assessment:
The model adequately captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS and selective predation on coral communities. However, the current coral dynamics do not account for interspecific competition for limited reef space. I propose a resource limitation mechanism by replacing the independent logistic term (1 - coral_cover) with a combined competitive term (1 - fast - slow). This change reflects the ecological reality that both fast- and slow-growing corals compete for the same limited space on the reef, thereby constraining growth as total coral cover increases. This improvement should enhance the realism of the model especially in predicting the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
