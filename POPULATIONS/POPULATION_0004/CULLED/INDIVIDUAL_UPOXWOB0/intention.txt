Assessment:
The current model effectively reproduces boom‐bust cycles using logistic growth combined with a smooth outbreak indicator. However, it oversimplifies resource availability by not considering that reduced coral cover limits the food available for Crown‐of‐Thorns starfish. Ecologically, as coral cover (both fast and slow) decreases, resource limitation should dampen COTS growth. 

To capture this feedback, a new resource availability term is introduced in the COTS logistic growth equation. This term calculates the normalized combined coral cover (fast_prev + slow_prev divided by 200) and scales it by a new parameter `resource_availability_coef`. This modification enhances model realism by linking coral depletion to reduced COTS growth potential.
