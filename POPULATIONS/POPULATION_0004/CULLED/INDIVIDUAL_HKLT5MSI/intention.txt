Assessment: The current model fits the data moderately well but oversimplifies outbreak dynamics by triggering outbreaks solely based on COTS abundance. Ecologically, outbreak growth should be resource‐limited, as high coral cover (food supply) can enhance outbreak growth but with diminishing returns. 

Improvement: A saturating (Michaelis–Menten-like) function has been introduced to modulate the outbreak-induced growth rate by total coral cover. A new parameter, coral_half, defines the coral cover at which the growth effect is half-maximized. This captures an essential ecological feedback, ensuring that outbreak events are sustained only when sufficient coral is available.
