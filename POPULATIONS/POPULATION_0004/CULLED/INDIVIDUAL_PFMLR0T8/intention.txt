Assessment:
The current model applies logistic growth and an outbreak indicator to simulate COTS dynamics. However, it omits an important feedback: resource limitation. In the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem, available coral cover crucially limits the COTS outbreak because lower coral cover reduces the food resources needed for explosive growth. 

Improvement:
We now scale the "boom" term by the normalized available coral cover, computed as (fast_prev + slow_prev)/200.0. This modification ensures that when coral cover is low, the potential for further explosive COTS growth is correspondingly reduced. This change enhances the model's capability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events while using only previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
