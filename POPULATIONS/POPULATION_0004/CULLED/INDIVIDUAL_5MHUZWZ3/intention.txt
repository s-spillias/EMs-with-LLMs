Assessment and Improvement:
---------------------------
1. The existing model captures outbreak events via a logistic trigger based on lagged COTS abundance.
2. However, the linear predation term (using gamma * cots_pred * (fast+slow)) oversimplifies real ecological dynamics.
3. Empirical evidence suggests that at high COTS densities, predation efficiency saturates due to interference or limited handling time.
4. To address this, we introduce a new parameter "tau" that implements a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) form: 
   cots_pred/(1 + tau*cots_pred).
5. This modification should improve the modelâ€™s ability to capture the boom-bust cycles and outbreak dynamics noted in the project context.
All computations remain based solely on previous time step values.
