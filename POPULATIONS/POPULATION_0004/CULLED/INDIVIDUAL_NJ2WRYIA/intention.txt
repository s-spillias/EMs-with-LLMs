This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
It captures the boom-bust cycle where COTS populations rapidly increase to outbreak levels and then decline.
Key ecological processes include:
1. Intrinsic population growth modulated by environmental conditions (e.g., sea-surface temperature and larval immigration).
2. Resource limitation through saturation and threshold effects (e.g., logistic growth with carrying capacity).
3. Selective predation on coral communities (differentiating between fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites corals).
4. Feedback loops and indirect effects between COTS abundance and coral health.
5. Smooth, numerically stable transitions via small constants (e.g., 1e-8) to prevent division by zero.
