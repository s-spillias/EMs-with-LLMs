  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with all canonical nutrient, phytoplankton and zooplankton fluxes present. Functional forms differ: phytoplankton uptake is implemented as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient term combined with an explicit light term via a smooth co-limitation (power-mean / smooth-min) rather than the TRUTH's specific N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) product. Grazing is implemented as a Hill/Holling functional response (flexible h exponent) with an explicit assimilation efficiency; zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms. The model also adds explicit excretion/egestion routing to dissolved nutrients and temperature (Q10) modifiers on many rates \u2014 processes not present (in that explicit form) in the TRUTH NPZ. Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles in TRUTH but uses alternate, literature-supported functional forms for many components and includes several additional processes.",
