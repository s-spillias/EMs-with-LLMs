  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ architecture: nutrient uptake via a Monod-like term, grazing via a Holling-type saturating function, assimilation-based zooplankton growth, recycling of unassimilated/generic mortalities, and a first-order mixing for nutrients. Differences from the TRUTH model are mostly in mechanistic choices: the candidate uses a time-varying seasonal environmental modifier (f_env) multiplying phytoplankton growth instead of TRUTH's static light/self-shading factor a/(b + c*P); zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) rather than the TRUTH linear loss; and recycling is handled as a fractional remineralization of unassimilated ingestion + mortalities rather than the TRUTH-specific terms. The candidate also uses an explicit Euler integrator and various modeling/optimization scaffolding (penalties, observation sd stabilizers) that are not ecological processes.",
