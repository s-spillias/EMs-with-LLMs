  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ structure (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth, grazing -> zooplankton growth, recycling, and mixing/dilution) and uses standard functional forms from the literature. Many TRUTH processes are present but parameterized differently: nutrient uptake is a Monod term combined with an explicit light co-limitation (smooth-min style) and temperature Q10 scaling rather than the exact N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) form in TRUTH. Grazing is a Hill/Holling functional response (the TRUTH grazing P^2/(mu^2+P^2) is a special case). The candidate adds several realistic extra processes (Q10 temperature modifiers, explicit light limitation/co-limitation, quadratic zooplankton mortality, explicit excretion and egestion routing, and explicit zooplankton dilution) that are not present in the TRUTH code.",
