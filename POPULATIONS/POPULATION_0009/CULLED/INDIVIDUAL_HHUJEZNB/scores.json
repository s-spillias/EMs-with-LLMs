  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements all canonical NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing loss, mortality, mixing; Z growth, mortality, mixing) but often with different mathematical choices. Uptake/growth are represented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term combined with an explicit light limitation and a smooth 'co-limitation' (smooth-min) instead of the TRUTH's single composite factor a/(b + c*P). Grazing is a Hill/Holling functional response (flexible exponent h) rather than the specific P^2/(mu^2+P^2) used in TRUTH. Recycling is present and more explicitly partitioned into P-mortality remineralization, Z mortality remineralization, excretion and an explicit egested fraction routed to dissolved N. The candidate also adds several ecological processes not in the TRUTH model (temperature Q10 modifier; explicit self-shading light attenuation; smooth co-limitation operator; quadratic zooplankton mortality; explicit egestion/excretion routing to dissolved N; and dilution applied to Z).",
