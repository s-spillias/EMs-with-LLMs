Assessment and rationale

1) Model fit
- Quantitative assessment pending: residuals file was referenced but not provided in this context, so I cannot compute residual statistics or diagnose bias/variance patterns. Please share the residuals so I can complete this step (e.g., mean bias, autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity across N/P/Z).

2) Alignment with project context
- The model explicitly simulates mixed-layer N, P, and Z with biologically grounded processes: Monod nutrient uptake, light limitation, co-limitation via smooth-min, herbivory with Hill response, linear and quadratic mortalities, egestion/excretion routing to dissolved nutrients, and mixed-layer exchange/dilution with a source concentration (N_in). Observation errors use a lognormal likelihood. This structure is appropriate for typical NPZ dynamics in a mixed layer.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Light environment: Light limitation currently uses a constant L_avail, which does not reflect biomass-dependent self-shading. In mixed layers, self-shading is a key negative feedback that moderates bloom peaks and improves N–P–Z phasing.
- Temperature scaling: Q10 has been updated from literature and is appropriately used for growth, linear mortalities, excretion, and grazing. Quadratic zooplankton mortality (gamma_Z) remains unscaled; this is defensible (predation/aggregative losses may not follow the same Q10), but is a potential future refinement.
- Detrital/export pool: The model implicitly exports the non-remineralized fraction of mortalities ((1 - r_PN), (1 - r_ZN)), which is acceptable as a lumped sink without an explicit D state.

Review of parameter values and structure implications
- Q10 updated to 2.06 (upper bound 2.46). Current usage propagates temperature dependence to primary production, linear losses, excretion, and grazing. No structural change required for these terms. Gamma_Z remains unscaled; we leave it as-is to keep the current change set narrowly focused.

Chosen ecological improvement

Add phytoplankton self-shading to light limitation.
- Ecological justification: As phytoplankton biomass increases, light within the mixed layer declines due to absorption/scattering, reducing growth rates. This mechanism is frequently needed to reproduce realistic bloom saturation and decay in NPZ systems.
- Mathematical change:
  - Effective light: L_eff = L_avail * exp(-k_I * P_prev)
  - Light limitation: fL = L_eff / (K_L + L_eff)
  - Co-limitation retained: co_lim = smooth-min(fN, fL; alpha_colim)
- Data-leakage policy: Only previous-step predicted P (P_prev) is used to compute L_eff.
- New parameter: k_I (m^3 g C^-1), a Beer–Lambert style attenuation coefficient. Prior bounds suggest 0–10 with an initial estimate of 0.3; this allows the fit to discover appropriate shading intensity.
- Diagnostics added: L_eff_pred time series to inspect the magnitude and timing of light limitation after shading.
- Regularization: Added a weak smooth penalty to keep k_I within a reasonable range without dominating the likelihood.

Expected impact
- Reduces unrealistically rapid or sustained phytoplankton growth under high biomass by introducing a negative feedback via self-shading.
- Can improve timing and amplitude of P peaks, and consequently the N drawdown and Z responses.

Future candidates (not implemented here)
- Consider temperature dependence of gamma_Z if residuals suggest biased Z dynamics across temperature.
- Allow seasonal or time-varying surface light (L_avail) if external forcing is available.
