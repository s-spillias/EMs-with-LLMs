  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling and mixing terms. Many ecological roles in the TRUTH Python NPZ are present in the candidate, often with algebraically equivalent or functionally similar forms (e.g., grazing as a Hill/Holling saturating response; linear phytoplankton mortality; nutrient mixing as D*(N_in - N)). The candidate departs from TRUTH by adding explicit environmental/physiological modulators (temperature Q10, separate light limitation with self-shading and a smooth co-limitation formulation), extra zooplankton processes (quadratic mortality, explicit excretion) and by applying mixed-layer dilution to Z as well as to P and N. In many places the candidate uses literature alternative families (Monod uptake, Hill/Holling grazing, multiplicative temp \u00d7 resource limitation) rather than the exact algebraic factors in TRUTH, but core mass flows (N\u2192P uptake, P\u2192Z grazing\u2192Z growth with assimilation, mortality\u2192N recycling, mixing) are all represented.",
