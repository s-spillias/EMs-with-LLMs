  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake -> P growth, grazing -> Z growth, recycling to nutrients, and physical exchange. Many processes map directly to the TRUTH model but are implemented with different (often more modular or general) functional forms: uptake is Monod/Monod\u00d7light co-limited (smooth co-lim), grazing is a Holling/Hill-type response (general h), mortalities include both linear and quadratic terms, and there is an explicit partitioning of remineralization (mortality, excretion, egestion). The candidate also adds temperature (Q10) modifiers and explicit excretion/egestion routing and applies mixed-layer dilution to Z \u2014 these are extra processes relative to the TRUTH NPZ.",
