  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a mechanistic NPZ with the canonical roles present: nutrient uptake fueling phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven transfer to zooplankton with assimilation, remineralization back to dissolved nutrient, and mixing of nutrients with an external reservoir. Many processes match the TRUTH model conceptually (and several match the same mathematical families), but the candidate uses different/expanded functional forms: nutrient uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten combined with an explicit environmental (seasonal + self-shading) modifier using a smooth co-limitation formulation; grazing is implemented as a Holling-type saturating function with configurable exponent (so it can reproduce the TRUTH P^2 form); zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms (extra density-dependence). The candidate therefore mostly maps to TRUTH and to known literature alternates, but it adds explicit seasonal forcing/co-limitation machinery and quadratic zooplankton mortality that are not present in the TRUTH Python code.",
