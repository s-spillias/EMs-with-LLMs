  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the NPZ roles (uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing, mortality) but uses different mathematical choices than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake is implemented via a Monod-like nutrient factor combined with an explicit uptake-to-growth efficiency; recycling is implemented as a fractional remineralization of losses rather than the TRUTH's explicit immediate return terms; mixing is present for nutrients and matches the TRUTH form, but mixing of phytoplankton is missing. Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type III (Hill) functional response and zooplankton growth uses an assimilation efficiency. The candidate adds several extra processes (seasonal light forcing, fractional remineralization, quadratic mortalities, explicit uptake efficiency) and uses smoothing transforms/penalties for numerical stability and parameter bounding.",
