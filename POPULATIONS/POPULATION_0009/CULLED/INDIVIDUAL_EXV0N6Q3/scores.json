  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a canonical NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth \u2192 recycling \u2192 nutrient pool + mixing) and therefore matches the TRUTH model at the level of major mass flows. Key matches: Monod-type nutrient limitation for uptake, Holling-type III grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, and a linear mixing flux on N. Key differences / alternates vs TRUTH: (1) phytoplankton growth uses an explicit seasonal/environmental modifier f_env(t) rather than the TRUTH factor a/(b + c*P), (2) assimilation efficiency is dynamic (beta_eff depends on nutrient limitation) rather than constant, (3) zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) instead of linear in TRUTH, and (4) the candidate omits an explicit mixing/removal term from P (TRUTH had -(s + k)*P). The candidate also uses an Euler forward integrator and estimation-oriented soft-penalty machinery (not ecological processes).",
