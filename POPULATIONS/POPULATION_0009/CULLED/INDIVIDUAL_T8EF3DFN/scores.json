  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Monod nutrient limitation, a Holling-III style grazing, assimilation to Z, and explicit recycling and mixing \u2014 but it departs from the TRUTH model in important ways. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as Monod * environmental modifier (f_env)* rather than the TRUTH's exact (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P)) form; grazing is Holling-III with additional Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference; recycling is more explicit via an added detritus pool with partitioning between immediate remineralization and detritus (with sinking and remineralization). Several canonical terms are present (uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing, mortality) but some are implemented as alternates (e.g., quadratic Z mortality, nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency, seasonal f_env) and phytoplankton mixing/entrainment present in TRUTH is missing in the candidate. Overall the candidate is ecologically richer (detritus, interference, variable assimilation, seasonal forcing) and uses an Euler integrator rather than the ODE integrator used in TRUTH.",
