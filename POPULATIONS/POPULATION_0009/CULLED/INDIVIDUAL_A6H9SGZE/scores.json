  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ formulation with the canonical mass flows (uptake, recycling, mixing; growth, grazing, mortality) but using different mathematical choices than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented by a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient term combined with an explicit seasonal light limiter using a smooth Liebig-like co-limitation function, rather than the TRUTH's multiplicative N*(a/(b+cP)) form. Grazing is Holling-type III but augmented by Beddington\u2013DeAngelis predator interference and then drives zooplankton growth via an assimilation efficiency; recycling is implemented as a lumped remineralization fraction acting on mortalities and unassimilated ingestion. Mixing of nutrients is identical to TRUTH. Several additional ecological processes (seasonal forcing, interference, quadratic mortality, explicit uptake efficiency, and a lumped remineralization fraction) are present in the candidate but not in the TRUTH model.",
