  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Monod), Holling-type III grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, recycling of unassimilated ingestion and mortalities back to nutrients, and a first-order mixing term for nutrients. It differs from the TRUTH form in two main ways: (1) phytoplankton growth is modulated by an explicit seasonal environmental modifier (inv_logit(sin(...))) rather than the TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) factor, and (2) zooplankton losses include an explicit quadratic mortality term in addition to linear mortality. The candidate also omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking loss term (P-mixing) present in TRUTH as part of -(s + k) * P, and packs recycling into a single remin_frac multiplier on multiple loss terms rather than the TRUTH's separate structure.",
