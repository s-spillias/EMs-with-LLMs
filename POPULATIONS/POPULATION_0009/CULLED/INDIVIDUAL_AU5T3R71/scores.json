  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model that captures the canonical roles present in the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing loss, mortality, mixing; zooplankton growth, mortality, mixing) but uses different mathematical choices for many terms. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are formulated as Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light limitation and a smooth co-limitation (power-mean / smooth min). Grazing is a Hill/Holling-type functional response with optional predator interference (Beddington\u2013DeAngelis). Recycling to nutrients is explicit (mortality remineralization, excretion, and egestion routing). The candidate also adds several extra ecological processes not in the TRUTH code (temperature/Q10 modifiers, explicit self-shading light attenuation, predator interference, quadratic zooplankton mortality, explicit excretion/egestion routing, and a tunable co-limitation exponent). Overall the candidate is structurally consistent with NPZ model families in the literature (alternate formulations), but not an exact line-by-line match to the TRUTH algebra.",
