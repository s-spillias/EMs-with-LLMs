  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with the canonical ecological roles present (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; phytoplankton growth, grazing, mortality, mixing; zooplankton growth, mortality, mixing). Many terms are structurally similar to the TRUTH NPZ but use different standard parameterizations: uptake/growth are represented as Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation combined with an explicit light limitation using a smooth co-limitation (not the exact N/(e+N) * a/(b + cP) form in TRUTH); grazing is a Hill/Holling functional response (the TRUTH used a P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) form which the candidate can represent via h=2); recycling and remineralization are present but partitioned differently (explicit excretion, egestion-to-N fraction, mortality recycling fractions). The candidate also adds several realistic extra processes (temperature Q10 modification of rates, explicit light co-limitation, explicit egestion/egestion-to-N, quadratic zooplankton mortality, explicit zooplankton dilution) that are not in the TRUTH script. Overall, the candidate matches or maps to the TRUTH for most canonical roles, often as an alternate (standard) formulation; a few elements are exact structural matches (mixing on N, Holling/Hill grazing family when h=2, linear phytoplankton mortality), while others are legitimate alternates or extras.",
