  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ-style model with all three state updates (N, P, Z) and observation model. It uses a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation (fN = N/(K_N+N)) combined with an explicit light limitation (fL) via an effective light term (L_eff = L_avail * exp(-k_shade * P)) and a smooth co-limitation (alpha_colim) to form growth muP. Grazing is implemented as a Holling/Hill-type functional response (Ph^h/(Kh+Ph)) multiplied by Z and an assimilation efficiency AE_Z routes a fraction of ingestion into Z growth; excretion, egestion and explicit remineralization fractions return material to N. Mixed-layer exchange/dilution (D_mix*(N_in - N), D_mix*P, D_mix*Z) is included. Overall, the candidate matches the ecological roles in the TRUTH NPZ, but with different (and more mechanistic/parameterized) functional forms in many places (temperature dependence via Q10, self-shading light attenuation, Hill-exponent grazing, explicit egestion/excretion, quadratic Z mortality, and Z dilution), which are either alternate formulations of TRUTH components or additional processes not present in TRUTH.",
