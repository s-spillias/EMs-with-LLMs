  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N uptake by P, P growth and grazing losses, Z growth via assimilated grazing, mortality, and mixing) but using different functional choices and extra processes. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term combined with an explicit light co-limitation (power-mean/smooth-min), and rates are temperature-modified (Q10). Grazing is a Hill/Holling functional response (generalized exponent h) so functionally equivalent to the TRUTH Hill(2) grazing but more general and temperature-dependent. Recycling to nutrients is explicit via fractions of mortalities plus an explicit zooplankton excretion term. The candidate also includes explicit mixed-layer dilution for N, P and Z and a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term \u2014 all of which deviate from the TRUTH parameterization. Overall, most canonical roles are present but implemented as alternates (Michaelis\u2013Menten, Hill grazing, explicit excretion, Q10 modifiers); mixing of N matches TRUTH exactly.",
