  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ processes in a recognisable way: nutrient uptake is Monod-type (N/(K+N)) driving phytoplankton growth, grazing is a Holling-type (Holling III) functional response with an explicit assimilation efficiency feeding zooplankton growth, and there is an explicit first-order mixing term for nutrients identical in form to TRUTH. The candidate differs from the TRUTH model in important ways: phytoplankton growth is multiplied by an explicit seasonal environmental modifier f_env(t) (a bounded sin\u2192logit function) rather than the TRUTH's P-dependent light factor a/(b + c P); zooplankton mortality includes an additional quadratic density-dependent term not present in TRUTH; and the candidate omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking loss term present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches the TRUTH model for many components (Monod uptake, Holling-III grazing family, linear mortalities, nutrient mixing) but uses legitimate alternate formulations for others (seasonal forcing, explicit remineralisation pooling and quadratic Z mortality) and omits P mixing.",
