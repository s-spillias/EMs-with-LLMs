Assessment and rationale

Fit to data
- I do not currently have the residuals file referenced in the instructions, so I cannot quantify bias, variance structure, or autocorrelation in residuals. Please provide that file for a thorough fit assessment (e.g., systematic P overprediction during bloom peaks or delayed Z peaks would point to missing feedbacks).
- Qualitatively, constant light availability (L_avail) often yields overly strong blooms and phase mismatches in NPZ systems because it omits self-shading. This is a common source of residual structure.

Alignment with project context
- The model simulates N, P, Z in a mixed layer with nutrient uptake (Monod), light limitation, temperature scaling (Q10), grazing (Hill), linear and quadratic mortalities, excretion, remineralization, and mixed-layer exchange. This is a standard, appropriate structure for the stated context.

Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Light regime: Currently constant. In mixed layers, effective light declines with phytoplankton biomass via self-shading (Beer–Lambert attenuation). This feedback helps regulate blooms and impacts trophic transfer.
- Detritus/DOM pools: Absent. Mortality/excretion are instantly remineralized or lost, which simplifies recycling pathways. Adding a detrital pool would be more complex and is deferred.
- Temperature structure: Q10 has up-to-date literature value (~2). With T == T_ref in defaults, temperature modifier equals 1, making Q10 non-informative unless T varies; acceptable for now.
- Zooplankton processes: Assimilation efficiency (AE_Z) is fixed; could be food-quality or temperature dependent, but that adds complexity and identifiability concerns without supporting data.

Chosen single improvement: dynamic light with self-shading (environmental modifier)
- Ecological reasoning: As P increases, water column light decreases due to self-shading, reducing phytoplankton growth and moderating bloom magnitude and timing. This is a well-supported feedback and improves realism with minimal added complexity.
- Mathematical form:
  L_eff = L_avail * exp(-k_self * P_prev)
  f_L   = L_eff / (K_L + L_eff)
  where k_self ≥ 0 is a self-shading coefficient ((g C m^-3)^-1). This preserves the existing saturating light limitation and smooth co-limitation (alpha_colim) while making light responsive to biomass.
- Implementation details:
  - New parameter k_self with bounds [0, 10].
  - fL uses L_eff computed from previous timestep’s P_pred (no data leakage).
  - Added diagnostic output L_eff_pred to inspect effective light trajectories.
  - Added a gentle penalty to discourage k_self < 0 or unrealistically large values.

Parameter review notes
- Q10 updated_from_literature = true with value 1.99 and narrowed upper bound; equation structure remains appropriate. Because T == T_ref by default, temperature scaling is neutral in the baseline; we keep it for generality across datasets with temperature variation.
- L_avail is now interpreted as baseline/background light before attenuation; this clarifies its role given the new self-shading mechanism.

Next steps requested
- Please provide the residuals file so I can evaluate fit improvements quantitatively (e.g., reduction in peak biases, residual autocorrelation, and potential needs for additional mechanisms like variable AE_Z or detrital recycling).
