  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Monod-type nutrient limitation driving phytoplankton growth, a Holling Type-III grazing response, assimilation-mediated zooplankton growth, recycling of unassimilated ingestion and mortalities, and nutrient mixing. Several formulations differ from the TRUTH model: phytoplankton growth is modulated by an explicit seasonal (light/temperature) modifier rather than the TRUTH's (a/(b + c P)) term, zooplankton mortality is quadratic rather than linear, and assimilation efficiency is made nutrient-dependent. Overall the candidate uses canonical ecological building blocks but with plausible alternate choices (Monod uptake, Holling-III grazing, quadratic Z mortality, explicit seasonal forcing, variable assimilation efficiency).",
