  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ structure consistent with standard ecological formulations but not identical to the TRUTH Python model. Core roles (uptake, grazing, mortality, remineralization) are present. Uptake/growth is represented as a nutrient + light co-limited, temperature-modulated production term (smooth-min co-limitation \u00d7 Q10), whereas the TRUTH model uses a specific multiplicative N/(e+N) \u00d7 a/(b+cP) form. Grazing is a Holling (Hill) type and assimilation feeds Z growth and N recycling; this matches the TRUTH model in role but with different functional forms (flexible Hill exponent, explicit unassimilated fraction). The candidate adds explicit temperature dependence (Q10), an explicit light availability / self-shading formulation and a smooth co-limitation operator, and a quadratic density-dependent zooplankton mortality term \u2014 all of which are not encoded in the TRUTH NPZ. The candidate omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for N, P, and Z that appears in the TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and a mixing contribution in P).",
