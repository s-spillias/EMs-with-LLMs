  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with all canonical roles (uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing, mortalities, assimilation) present. It does not literally copy the TRUTH algebra, but rather uses common alternate formulations: Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake combined with a smooth co-limitation of light and nutrient (generalized mean / smooth-min), a Hill/Holling grazing functional response, linear phytoplankton mortality plus explicit dilution, and assimilation-based zooplankton growth. The candidate also adds explicit temperature (Q10) modifiers, explicit excretion/egestion routing, quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality, and explicit dilution for zooplankton \u2014 processes not present (or not explicit) in the TRUTH code. Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and matches the TRUTH model in roles, but several process forms are alternate rather than exact matches.",
