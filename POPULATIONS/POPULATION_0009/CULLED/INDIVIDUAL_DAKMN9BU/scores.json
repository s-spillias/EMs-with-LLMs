  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling, and mixing of nutrients) but uses alternate functional forms and adds explicit recycling/detritus bookkeeping and seasonal & nutrient-dependent modifiers. Uptake/growth use a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) form multiplied by a seasonal f_env (an explicit light/season modifier) instead of the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c*P)) factor. Grazing is implemented as a Hill/Holling-III function (generalized exponent) which matches the TRUTH family. The candidate introduces an explicit detritus pool with partitioning (remin_frac), detritus remineralization and sinking, and a nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency (beta_eff) \u2014 none of which appear in the TRUTH model. Important omissions relative to TRUTH: the candidate does not include explicit physical mixing losses for P or Z (TRUTH has -(s + k)*P and q*Z includes linear loss), instead applying mixing only to N via a k_mix*(N_deep - N) term.",
