Assessment overview (pending residuals file):
- Fit quality: Unable to quantitatively evaluate without the residuals file or fit diagnostics. The model’s lognormal likelihood with stabilized SD and reported residuals is appropriate for evaluation once provided.
- Alignment with project context: The model captures core NPZ mixed-layer dynamics with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, seasonal environmental modulation, Holling III grazing, variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency (nutrient-dependent), a detrital pool with remineralization and sinking, and deep mixing. This is an ecologically coherent baseline.
- Potential oversimplifications/missing processes:
  1) Zooplankton mortality is purely quadratic. Many systems benefit from an added linear (density-independent) term to represent background mortality and higher trophic predation, which helps prevent unrealistically persistent zooplankton at low biomass.
  2) Multi-nutrient or explicit light/temperature limitation is abstracted into a seasonal modifier; this is acceptable for simplicity but can miss episodic events.
  3) Stoichiometry and prey quality beyond f_N effects are not modeled (reasonable for a simple model).

Chosen improvement: Add linear zooplankton mortality (mZ_linear)
- Ecological rationale: Represents baseline losses (e.g., higher trophic predation, senescence) not captured by quadratic self-mortality, and commonly improves fits by reducing Z overprediction at low biomass.
- Mathematical changes:
  Let G = g_max * (P^h / (K_G^h + P^h)) * Z, f_N = N / (K_N + N), f_env = inv_logit(ι + A sin(2π t / T + φ)), and β_eff = inv_logit(logit(β) + β_slope_fN (f_N - 0.5)).
  Then:
    dP/dt = μ_max f_N f_env P − G − mP P
    dZ/dt = β_eff G − mZ_linear Z − mZ_quadratic Z^2
    dD/dt = (1 − remin_frac) [ (1 − β_eff) G + mP P + mZ_linear Z + mZ_quadratic Z^2 ] − remin_rate_D D − sink_rate_D D
    dN/dt = − μ_max f_N f_env P
            + remin_frac [ (1 − β_eff) G + mP P + mZ_linear Z + mZ_quadratic Z^2 ]
            + remin_rate_D D
            + k_mix (N_deep − N)
- Implementation notes:
  - Added parameter mZ_linear (d^-1) with soft bounds [0, 1].
  - Linear Z mortality contributes to the same remineralization/Detritus pathways as other losses, maintaining mass balance.
  - No data leakage: predictions use only previous-step states.
  - Minimal complexity increase with clear ecological benefit.

Requests for follow-up:
- Please provide the residuals file (or summary plots/statistics) from the latest fit so I can evaluate improvements and check for remaining issues (e.g., seasonal phase bias, nutrient drawdown timing, low-biomass biases).
