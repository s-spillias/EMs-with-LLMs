This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It captures the rapid boom-bust cycles typical of these outbreaks, incorporating mechanisms such as multiple forms of resource limitation (including saturating functions and threshold effects), selective predation on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Porites spp.) coral communities, and environmental modifiers like sea-surface temperature. The model also includes process-specific efficiencies, indirect feedback loops, and smooth transitions to ensure numerical stability.
