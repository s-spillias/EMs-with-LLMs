Assessment:
The current model reasonably fits the observed outbreak cycles, but the residuals indicate that extreme COTS outbreak levels are not well captured. In particular, the model lacks a mechanism that curbs runaway growth when COTS numbers become very high.

Improvement:
Introduce a density-dependent self-limitation term in COTS growth to represent increased mortality or competition at higher densities. This is implemented as an additional quadratic term in the growth equation. The new parameter, self_limitation_rate, captures this negative feedback and aligns with the ecological understanding that very high population densities will naturally suppress further growth.

This approach better captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks by incorporating a non-linear regulation mechanism.
