Assessment and rationale for improvement

1) Model fit to data:
- The residuals file was referenced but is not provided in the current context, so a quantitative assessment of fit (bias, autocorrelation, tails) cannot be completed here. Please provide residuals to refine this assessment.
- Structurally, the model includes key elements that generally enable good fits to boom-bust dynamics: prey-dependent COTS demography (via food intake), a one-year recruitment lag, temperature-dependent reproduction, Allee effects, and coral loss feedback on COTS carrying capacity. These can reproduce rapid rises and subsequent collapses when prey becomes limiting.

2) Alignment with the project context (COTS episodic outbreaks):
- Strengths: 
  - Boom-bust potential is present via logistic population growth with carrying capacity tied to coral cover and an Allee effect at low density.
  - Outbreak triggers/sustainers include: higher food intake (more coral), warm temperature windows (T_perf), and external larval supply (cotsimm_dat), with a lag in reproduction.
  - Selective predation on fast vs slow corals is represented (aF > aS, separate handling times).
- Gaps relative to context:
  - Bleaching-driven mortality is applied equally to both coral groups via a single m_bleach_max. However, Acropora (fast coral) is substantially more bleaching-sensitive than Faviidae/Porites (slow coral). Equal mortality can mute a critical feedback: preferential collapse of Acropora reduces preferred prey, accelerating COTS busts and shaping outbreak duration.
  - Stage-structure of COTS (cryptic juveniles, delayed emergence) is simplified to a scalar lag. 
  - Other potential outbreak drivers (nutrient-driven larval survival from flood/runoff pulses) are not explicitly modeled.
  - Disturbances (cyclones) and interspecific competition (e.g., macroalgae) are not represented.

3) Potentially missing/oversimplified ecological processes:
- Differential bleaching mortality between fast and slow corals (high-impact on outbreak dynamics).
- Stage-structured COTS or explicit juvenile refuge dynamics.
- Environmentally driven larval survival (nutrient/chl pulses).
- Dynamic prey switching or preference that varies with coral composition.
- Catastrophic disturbances and competitive processes affecting coral recovery.

Parameter review and updated evidence considerations
- m_bleach_max (single shared value) is a structural simplification. Literature consistently indicates Acropora has higher bleaching-induced mortality than massive corals. Using a single parameter may bias both coral dynamics and COTS boom-bust timing.
- Other parameters appear reasonable for initial estimation ranges: rF > rS, aF > aS, q_func ≥ 1 (Type II–III), and Allee effect (A50) present. If residuals show overly long outbreak tails or muted peaks, candidates to revisit include q_func, handling times, and the linearity of Kc with coral cover (potentially saturating).

Chosen improvement (one meaningful ecological enhancement)
- Approach: Environmental modifier with group-specific effect (differential bleaching mortality).
- Change: Replace the single bleaching mortality parameter m_bleach_max with two parameters:
  - m_bleach_max_F: maximum additional mortality for fast coral (Acropora) under extreme heat.
  - m_bleach_max_S: maximum additional mortality for slow coral (Faviidae/Porites) under extreme heat.
- Ecological justification: Acropora exhibits higher bleaching susceptibility and mortality than massive corals; this differential loss can truncate outbreaks by rapidly reducing preferred prey, thereby reducing COTS intake and carrying capacity sooner—better capturing observed outbreak duration and post-peak collapse.
- Mathematical changes:
  Previously:
    mBleach = m_bleach_max * B_t
    F_after_mort = F_survive * exp(-(dF_base + mBleach))
    S_after_mort = S_survive * exp(-(dS_base + mBleach))
  Now:
    mBleach_F = m_bleach_max_F * B_t
    mBleach_S = m_bleach_max_S * B_t
    F_after_mort = F_survive * exp(-(dF_base + mBleach_F))
    S_after_mort = S_survive * exp(-(dS_base + mBleach_S))
- Parameterization guidance:
  - Initial values: m_bleach_max_F ≈ 0.5 yr^-1, m_bleach_max_S ≈ 0.25 yr^-1
  - Bounds: [0.0, 1.0] yr^-1 for both. These reflect plausible annual additional mortality rates under extreme bleaching.
- Expected effect on dynamics:
  - Faster collapse of Acropora during heat stress elevates food limitation and reduces carrying capacity sooner, sharpening and shortening outbreaks, which better matches observed boom-bust patterns.
  - Maintains simplicity while adding a key, well-supported asymmetry.

Notes
- No current-time observations are used in prediction updates; the change preserves this property.
- Future potential additions (if residuals indicate need): saturating Kc vs coral (Michaelis-Menten), nutrient/runoff-driven larval survival modifier, or explicit juvenile stage dynamics.
