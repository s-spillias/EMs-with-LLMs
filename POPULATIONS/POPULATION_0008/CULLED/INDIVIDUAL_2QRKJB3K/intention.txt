Goal: Predict episodic Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS; Acanthaster cf. solaris) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and their impacts on coral communities, focusing on timing, magnitude, and duration of boom–bust cycles.

Core ecological functioning:
- State variables: Adult COTS density (individuals m^-2), fast-growing coral cover (Acropora; %), and slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites; %). Exogenous drivers include sea-surface temperature (SST, °C) and larval immigration rate (individuals m^-2 yr^-1).
- Outbreak triggering and sustainment: Recruitment to the adult population is driven by (i) exogenous larval immigration pulses, (ii) local fecundity proportional to adult density, and (iii) larval survival shaped by temperature. A smooth threshold-like response to larval supply captures abrupt transitions into outbreak states without discontinuities.
- Feedbacks and resource limitation: COTS feeding reduces coral cover via a saturating (Holling II) functional response with preference for fast-growing Acropora. Reduced coral cover increases COTS mortality via starvation and lowers fecundity (food-limited), providing a negative feedback that ends outbreaks. Coral regrowth is logistic and constrained by a total cover capacity (K), introducing interspecific competition for space.
- Environmental modulation: Warm-temperature stress (high SST) impairs coral growth/cover via a smooth bleaching response that reduces intrinsic coral growth rates. Larval survival exhibits a bell-shaped (Gaussian) thermal performance curve centered at an optimal SST.
- Numerical robustness: All transitions are smooth (no hard cutoffs). Small constants guard divisions and logs. Observation models are lognormal for strictly positive quantities with minimum standard deviations.

Intended use: Fit to time series of COTS, fast, and slow coral cover with SST and larval immigration as covariates. The model predicts outbreak onset, peak, and collapse, while tracking selective predation impacts on coral community composition.
