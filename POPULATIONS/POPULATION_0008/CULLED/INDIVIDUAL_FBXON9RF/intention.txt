Assessment and Ecological Improvement:

After evaluating the current model and its residuals, we found that the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks are not fully captured. In particular, the constant conversion efficiency (from predation on coral to COTS growth) neglects the likely density‐dependent interference that occurs at high COTS densities. During outbreaks, individual starfish may compete for prey or experience reduced feeding efficiency. 

To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "cots_efficiency_decay", that reduces the effective efficiency as COTS density increases. The effective efficiency is calculated as:

    effective_efficiency = efficiency / (1 + cots_efficiency_decay * cots_pred(t-1))

This modification enhances the model’s ecological realism by dampening COTS population growth during high-density outbreaks, thereby improving the fit to boom‐bust dynamics observed in nature.
