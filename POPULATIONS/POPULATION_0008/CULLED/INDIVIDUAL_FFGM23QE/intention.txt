This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. 
Residual analysis indicates that the current logistic regulation of COTS growth (using a linear density‐dependence term) 
may be oversimplified, as it does not capture the sharp population crashes after outbreak booms. 

As an ecological improvement, we have modified the logistic term to incorporate squared density‐dependence. 
In this formulation, the growth term becomes:

    mod_growth * cots_pred(t-1) * [1 - (cots_pred(t-1)/threshold)^2]

This change introduces a more abrupt transition at high COTS densities, representing stronger density‐dependent feedbacks 
(e.g., resource depletion, intraspecific competition, or intensified predator interference) that curb outbreak magnitude. 
This adjustment is justified by the observed boom-bust cycles in COTS populations and aligns the model more closely 
with known ecological dynamics seen on the Reef.
