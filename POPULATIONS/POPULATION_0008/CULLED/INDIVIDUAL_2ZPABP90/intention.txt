This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It captures the boom-bust cycle dynamics where COTS populations rapidly increase to outbreak levels and then decline. The model incorporates resource limitation via saturating functions and threshold effects, selective predation on different coral types (fast-growing Acropora vs. slow-growing Faviidae/Porities), environmental modifiers, and feedback loops. Ecosystem processes and initial conditions drive predictions on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions.
