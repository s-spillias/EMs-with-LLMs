Assessment and rationale for changes

1) Model fit (needs residuals)
- I do not have the residuals file mentioned in the instructions, so I cannot quantify fit or analyze error structure at this time.
- Based on model structure alone, direct recruitment of larvae to adults likely causes adult peaks to respond too quickly to same-year conditions (SST, immigration, and adult stock), which can misalign outbreak timing relative to observations.
- Please provide the residuals file so I can verify improvements and refine further (e.g., check for phase lead/lag, amplitude bias, and duration of peaks).

2) Alignment with project context
- The model already includes: prey preference (fast vs slow coral), functional response consumption, space-limited coral growth with bleaching modifiers, food-limited fecundity, Beverton–Holt density dependence, and an outbreak logistic threshold in larval supply.
- These capture many essential features of COTS–coral interactions.
- However, episodic boom–bust cycles for COTS depend critically on developmental delays (time to maturity), which the current model omits.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Key missing process: ontogenetic delay (larval/juvenile to adult). COTS typically require ~1–3 years to reach adulthood; immediate adult recruitment suppresses the temporal separation between larval pulses and adult outbreaks.
- Other potential refinements (not implemented here to keep the change focused and interpretable): explicit juvenile stage with separate mortality, runoff/nutrient-driven larval survival, disease/predation on COTS, dynamic diet switching.

Chosen improvement: one-year maturation delay to adults
- Ecological reasoning: Introducing a maturation delay is a minimal yet powerful change that better reproduces the timing and duration of adult outbreaks by decoupling adult abundance from same-year larval supply and environmental conditions.
- Mathematical implementation:
  - Compute recruitment R_t from previous-year states as before (no data leakage).
  - Adults receive R_{t-1} instead of R_t via a lag buffer R_lag (initialized to 0).
  - Adult update: cots(t) = softplus(cots(t-1) + R_{t-1} - M_adult(t-1)).
  - Coral equations and consumption unchanged.
- Expected effects:
  - Improved timing (adult peaks occur after larval supply peaks).
  - Potentially more realistic boom onset and bust duration via delayed response to food depletion and mortality.
  - Little added complexity; no new parameters required, aiding identifiability and robustness.

Parameter review and alignment
- T_opt has updated literature bounds (28–29 °C) in parameters.json. I aligned the model’s soft-bound penalty for T_opt with these tighter bounds to better reflect prior knowledge in the objective function.
- Other parameters appear reasonable given their roles and ranges. Many are initial estimates; once residuals are available, we can revisit whether additional structure (e.g., asymmetry in thermal performance, variable feeding efficiency, or explicit juvenile mortality/maturation rates) is warranted.

Next steps once residuals are available
- Check for remaining phase errors (lead/lag), amplitude bias, and autocorrelation in residuals.
- If outbreaks are still too synchronized with SST or immigration, consider:
  - Explicit juvenile compartment with maturation rate and juvenile mortality.
  - Runoff/nutrient proxy as an environmental multiplier on larval survival.
  - Predator/disease pressure as density-dependent mortality.
- Calibrate whether additional delay (e.g., 2 years) or partial maturation (fractional lag) improves fit without over-parameterization.
