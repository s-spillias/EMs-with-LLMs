Assessment:
The original model modulated COTS growth with a logistic term based on a coral cover threshold.
However, since outbreaks are triggered when there is sufficient coral available, we replace that mechanism
with a resource limitation term that scales COTS growth by the previous time step's total coral cover.
This approach better captures the boom‐bust dynamics observed in COTS outbreaks.
We also remove the unused "log_threshold" parameter.
All predictions continue to use only t‑1 values to avoid data leakage.
