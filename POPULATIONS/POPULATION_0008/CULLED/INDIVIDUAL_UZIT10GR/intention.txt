Purpose: Predict episodic Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS; Acanthaster cf. solaris) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef and their feedbacks on coral communities, emphasizing timing, magnitude, and duration of boom-bust cycles.

Core dynamics:
- COTS adults (individuals/m2) follow food-limited, density-dependent population dynamics with additional recruitment from larval immigration. Outbreaks emerge when favorable environmental conditions (warm sea surface temperature; SST) and elevated larval supply interact with high prey availability (especially fast-growing Acropora). A smooth “trigger” function amplifies per-capita growth when prey and immigration are high, capturing abrupt outbreak onset without hard thresholds.
- Coral cover (%), partitioned into fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing massive corals (Faviidae/Porites), grows logistically under a shared carrying capacity (space limitation) and is reduced by COTS predation. Predation follows a saturating multi-prey Holling Type II functional response with preference for fast corals.
- Environmental modulation: 
  - COTS larval survival and outbreak propensity increase with SST via a smooth logistic function around a thermal threshold.
  - Coral growth shows unimodal (Gaussian) thermal performance curves with taxon-specific optima and breadths.
- Feedbacks:
  - Positive: More fast coral → higher COTS feeding and recruitment → potential outbreak.
  - Negative: Coral depletion reduces future COTS food, increasing self-limitation and crash, producing boom-bust cycles.
- Multiple resource limitations:
  - Space (shared coral carrying capacity).
  - Saturating feeding with handling time across prey.
  - Density dependence in COTS.
  - Recruitment saturation from immigration.

Numerical and statistical design:
- All divisions include small constants; transitions use smooth sigmoids where thresholds are needed.
- Parameters are softly bounded within biologically meaningful ranges via smooth penalties (no hard constraints).
- Likelihood uses lognormal errors for strictly positive COTS abundance and normal errors on logit-transformed coral proportions. All observations contribute with minimum error floors.
- Initial conditions are fixed to the first observations for each state variable.
