ASSESSMENT
- Data fit: A residuals file was referenced but not provided here. Without it, quantitative diagnostics (autocorrelation, bias by phase, variance structure) cannot be computed. The present assessment focuses on process structure.
- Project context coverage: The model captures selective predation on fast (Acropora) and slow (Faviidae/Porites) corals, temperature-driven bleaching affecting coral survival/growth, and COTS reproduction modulated by food (functional response) and temperature with a 1-year lag, plus carrying capacity tied to coral. These ingredients can generate boom dynamics.
- Likely gap for outbreak termination: The model relies on logistic density regulation of COTS and a constant baseline mortality. This can produce slow approaches to carrying capacity and overly long high-density plateaus, underrepresenting observed rapid busts after outbreaks. Empirical evidence suggests intensified losses at high density via disease, predator aggregation, interference/cannibalism, and management removals.

MISSING OR OVERSIMPLIFIED PROCESSES
- Outbreak-intensified mortality: No mechanism currently increases COTS mortality specifically at high density relative to available habitat, a key feedback for realistic bust timing.
- Potential additional gaps (not addressed here to keep changes minimal and identifiable): episodic nutrient-driven larval survival, stage structure with juvenile refuges, algal competition limiting coral recovery, multi-year lags.

PARAMETER REVIEW
- mC_base (1.28065 yr^-1) and rC_max (3 yr^-1) are plausible literature-based values. However, with only logistic regulation, these can still allow prolonged high densities.
- Other parameters and bounds align with stated ranges; no structural inconsistencies noted.

CHOSEN IMPROVEMENT (ONE CHANGE)
- Add a smooth, density-dependent added mortality term for COTS that increases as population density approaches its habitat-defined capacity (Kc). This captures multiple outbreak-era loss processes while preserving low-density dynamics and the existing Allee effect:
  mC_dd(C) = mC_dd_max * logistic(dd_slope_C * (C/Kc - phi50_density))
  C_t = C_{t-1} + rC*C_{t-1}*(1 - C_{t-1}/Kc) - (mC_base + mC_dd(C))*C_{t-1} + gamma_imm*Imm_t
- Rationale: This targets the bust phase directly, sharpening declines from outbreak levels without adding exogenous drivers. It is stable, monotone, and tunable.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- New parameters:
  - mC_dd_max [0..5] yr^-1: maximum added mortality during extreme outbreaks.
  - dd_slope_C [0.5..50]: steepness of the mortality ramp.
  - phi50_density [0.2..0.95]: density fraction of capacity where added mortality is half-max.
- Numerical safeguards: invlogit_stable used; eps added where needed. No data leakage: only predicted states from t-1 are used in process equations.
- Next steps once residuals are available: Check for phase-specific bias (e.g., COTS overprediction persistence at peaks), calibrate mC_dd parameters, and re-evaluate whether additional environmental recruitment pulses or multi-year lags are required.

REQUEST
- Please provide the residuals file to further tailor parameter bounds and assess whether additional complexity (e.g., nutrient-driven recruitment pulses) is justified.
