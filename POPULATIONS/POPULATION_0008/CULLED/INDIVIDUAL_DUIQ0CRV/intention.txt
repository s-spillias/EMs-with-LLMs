Project Assessment and Model Improvement:

The current model reasonably captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreak events, but residual analysis indicates that the linear density‚Äêdependent reduction in feeding efficiency (through cots_efficiency_decay) underestimates interference effects at high COTS densities. Ecologically, as starfish numbers rise, interference among individuals likely reduces their efficiency nonlinearly. To address this, we introduce a nonlinear (quadratic) decay term in the efficiency calculation. The added parameter (log_efficiency_decay2) will capture the intensified reduction in efficiency at high densities, thereby improving model realism without compromising the existing formulation that avoids data leakage by only using past time-step values.
