Below are the proposed changes. We have chosen to incorporate a nonlinear density‐dependent term in the conversion efficiency. In our assessment, the residuals indicate that the current linear efficiency reduction (via cots_efficiency_decay) does not fully explain the observed steep decline in COTS growth at high densities. Therefore, we add a second‐order interference    
term that better captures the nonlinear reduction in efficiency at high starfish densities. This ecological improvement is justified by increasingly strong interference among starfish as their numbers surge.                                                                                                                                                                        

The changes are as follows:

 2 In parameters.json, add a new parameter log_efficiency_decay2 (on the log scale) with clear ecological justification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 3 In model.cpp, (a) add the new parameter declaration, and (b) modify the effective efficiency calculation to include a second‐order term that uses exp(log_efficiency_decay2).

 The current model reasonably captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreak events, but residual analysis indicates that the linear density‐dependent reduction in feeding efficiency (through cots_efficiency_decay) underestimates interference effects at high COTS densities. Ecologically, as starfish numbers rise, interference among individuals likely reduce 
 their efficiency nonlinearly. To address this, we introduce a nonlinear (quadratic) decay term in the efficiency calculation. The added parameter (log_efficiency_decay2) will capture the intensified reduction in efficiency at high densities, thereby improving model realism without compromising the existing formulation that avoids data leakage by only using past time-step 
 values.
