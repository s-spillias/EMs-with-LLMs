ASSESSMENT

1) Model fit to data
- A residuals file was referenced but is not present in this context, so a quantitative residual review was not possible. Please provide the residuals to refine diagnostics.
- Qualitative expectations to check in residuals:
  - COTS peaks: Are outbreak magnitudes underestimated (positive residuals at peaks) or busts too slow (positive residuals in post-peak years)?
  - Timing: Are peaks lagging observations (phase error), suggesting missing non-linear feedbacks or triggers?
  - Coral responses: During COTS peaks, are fast coral declines underestimated relative to slow coral?
  - Variance: Are residuals larger during outbreaks than inter-peak years (state-dependent process/obs error)?

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model already includes:
  - Selective predation on fast vs slow coral via a two-prey functional response with exponent q (Type II–III).
  - Space-limited coral growth with heat-stress suppression and bleaching mortality.
  - COTS reproduction modulated by adult food intake (I_sat), lagged thermal performance (Topt, sigma_T, alpha_larv), and an Allee effect (A50).
  - Theta-Ricker density regulation and exogenous immigration.
- Gaps relative to boom-bust dynamics:
  - Bust phase often occurs faster than a simple Ricker decline with fixed baseline mortality can produce. Empirical evidence suggests density-dependent predation, disease, and/or cannibalism intensify at high COTS densities, accelerating the collapse.
  - Environmental triggers such as nutrient-driven larval survival pulses are important but require additional drivers (not currently available here).

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Density-dependent COTS mortality (predation/disease/cannibalism) is missing; this is a key negative feedback that sharpens post-outbreak declines.
- Stage structure is not represented; however, adding stage structure would substantially increase complexity and parameterization requirements.
- Nutrient/runoff effects on larval survival are not included due to absent drivers.
- Variable fecundity tied to prey composition is approximated via I_sat but could be refined later if needed.

PARAMETER REVIEW

- Topt has been updated from literature (28.5°C; bounds 28–29°C), which supports a relatively narrow thermal window for larval performance. The current Gaussian thermal performance with sigma_T and a pulse-sharpness exponent alpha_larv remains appropriate and flexible; no structural change is required based solely on this update.
- Other parameters largely reflect initial estimates; bounds in the model are consistent with parameters.json.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT

Add saturating density-dependent COTS mortality:
- Rationale: Outbreak declines are often steeper than predicted by baseline mortality and Ricker-only regulation. Processes such as predator aggregation, disease spread, and cannibalism intensify with COTS density and saturate at high levels. A Holling type-II-like mortality increment captures this negative feedback without requiring new external data.
- Mathematical form:
  mC_dd(C) = mC_dd_max * C / (Kc_dd + C)
  Applied as an additional per-capita mortality term, so total mortality becomes:
  m_total = mC_base + mC_dd(C)
  The COTS update remains in the existing framework:
  C_t = C_{t-1} * exp(rC * (1 - (C_{t-1}/Kc)^theta_C)) - m_total * C_{t-1} + gamma_imm * immigration_{t-1}
- Expected effect: Sharper, more realistic busts after peaks; improved fit where residuals show persistent overprediction during post-peak years; better timing of declines without distorting outbreak onset mechanics.

NEW/UPDATED PARAMETERS

- mC_dd_max (year^-1): Maximum additional mortality rate at high densities.
  - Initial value: 1.0
  - Bounds: [0.0, 5.0]
  - Justification: Captures intensified loss processes; capped to prevent implausible mortality rates.
- Kc_dd (ind m^-2): Half-saturation density for density-dependent mortality.
  - Initial value: 0.5
  - Bounds: [0.01, 10.0]
  - Justification: Places half-effect at sub-outbreak to outbreak-level densities, allowing the data to infer where increased losses activate.

NOTES AND CAVEATS

- No data leakage introduced: the new mortality depends only on predicted C_{t-1}.
- If residuals reveal outbreak magnitudes are still underestimated, consider later adjusting food conversion (epsilon_food) to be composition- or temperature-dependent; not included here to keep one focused change.
- Provide the residuals file to validate whether post-peak bias decreases and whether timing improves under the new feedback.
