Assessment and rationale for improvement

1) Fit to data (based on model structure; residuals file not provided here)
- The model uses a lognormal observation model for COTS and logit-normal for corals, which is appropriate for positive densities and bounded covers.
- Mechanistically, the model should be able to reproduce broad increases in COTS when food is abundant and temperatures are suitable, with declines driven by mortality and crowding via carrying capacity tied to coral cover.
- To fully evaluate fit, I would inspect:
  - Time-aligned residuals for COTS: look for under-predicted outbreak peaks (positive residuals at peaks) and over-predicted inter-outbreak troughs (negative residuals), and temporal autocorrelation indicating missing dynamics.
  - Coral residuals: bias patterns during/after outbreaks (e.g., fast coral over-predation or slow coral under-predation), and whether bleaching years show systematic mismatches.
  - Cross-correlations between residuals and SST/immigration drivers to detect missing environmental modifiers.
Note: please provide the residuals file to confirm these diagnostics.

2) Alignment with project context (episodic outbreaks, timing/magnitude/duration)
- Strengths: The model includes selective foraging on fast vs slow corals, lagged thermal effects on larval survival, an Allee effect at low densities, and immigration. These are key processes for outbreak initiation and propagation.
- Potential limitation: The density dependence on COTS is currently linear logistic (1 - C/K), which often yields smoother dynamics and can dampen peaks. This can blunt the abrupt collapse phase and limit the episodicity of outbreaks.
- Consequence: Even with strong recruitment pulses, linear logistic crowding may not generate the sharp busts typically observed in COTS time series.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Nonlinear density dependence in COTS: Processes such as disease, predation switching to COTS at high density, and mating interference can produce stronger-than-linear density dependence, promoting rapid collapses post-peak.
- Environmental covariates beyond SST for larvae (e.g., flood-driven nutrients/chlorophyll) are not currently modeled due to lack of inputs; if such drivers are available, adding them could further refine outbreak timing.
- Age/stage structure and delayed feedbacks can also contribute to pulsed dynamics but add complexity and identifiability challenges.

Parameter review
- Many parameters have literature-informed priors/bounds (e.g., mC_base aligned with literature; thermal parameters Topt and sigma_T are reasonable).
- The observation SD floors via min_sd stabilize estimation.
- A50 (Allee) and alpha_larv (pulse sharpness) help episodicity but may still be insufficient for sharp busts without nonlinear crowding.
- No immediate inconsistencies suggest re-scaling of existing processes is needed; instead, the structure of density dependence is the main place to improve realism.

Chosen ecological improvement: theta-logistic density regulation for COTS
- Approach: Higher-order density dependence (theta-logistic).
- Implementation: Replace (1 - C/K) with (1 - (C/K)^theta_C), where theta_C â‰¥ 1.
- Ecological justification: Captures intensified negative feedback at high densities (e.g., disease, predator switching, interference), creating sharper post-peak collapses and more realistic boom-bust cycles.
- Expected effect on dynamics: For theta_C > 1, growth stays near-linear at low C (helping outbreaks initiate), but declines become much steeper when C approaches/exceeds K, promoting rapid busts.

Mathematical change in model.cpp
- Previous: deltaC = rC * C_prev * (1 - C_prev / Kc)
- New:      deltaC = rC * C_prev * (1 - (C_prev / Kc)^theta_C)
- Kc remains Kc0 + kCF*F_prev + kCS*S_prev and positivity safeguards are unchanged.
- No current-year observed variables are introduced; only model state and exogenous drivers are used.

Parameter additions in parameters.json
- Added theta_C with bounds [1, 6], initial value 1.5 (Type II to stronger-than-linear density dependence). This range is broad enough to capture mild to strong crowding while avoiding extreme overcompensation that may destabilize estimation.

How to validate the change
- Examine COTS residuals for reduced peak under-prediction and improved post-peak decline timing.
- Check that coral residuals remain well-behaved (the change targets COTS regulation only).
- Sensitivity: profile theta_C to ensure identifiability; if weak, consider fixing theta_C based on literature or constraining with informative priors (via penalties already in place).

If residuals indicate remaining deficiencies
- If outbreaks are still too smooth: consider introducing a second lag in recruitment (e.g., compounding environmental filters) or a saturating, nonlinear Kc response to coral cover.
- If collapses are too abrupt: decrease theta_C toward 1, or allow mC_base to vary with environment (e.g., temperature-dependent mortality).
