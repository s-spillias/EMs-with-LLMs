Assessment and rationale for the proposed improvement

1) Fit to data
- A residuals file was referenced but not provided in this chat. Please share it so I can quantify misfit (timing of peaks, peak magnitude, duration, serial correlation patterns).
- Based on structure alone, immediate adult growth from food/temperature (without developmental delay) can under-predict the speed and height of outbreaks or mis-time peaks. Outbreak datasets typically show a sharp rise with a lag after favorable spawning/survival conditions, then a crash once coral cover declines.

2) Alignment with project context
- The model already includes: selective coral predation (fast vs slow), space-limited coral growth, bleaching impacts, temperature-modulated COTS reproduction, immigration, and a coral-dependent carrying capacity for COTS.
- A key mechanism for episodic outbreaks is missing: a juvenile (cryptic) stage with time-to-maturity. This stage accumulates recruits during favorable conditions and later releases a pulse of adults, creating the boom. Coral loss then reduces adult carrying capacity, driving the bust.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Juvenile stage and maturation delay (critical for outbreak timing).
- Recruitment limitation and habitat-dependent transition to adulthood.
- Immigration likely acts primarily on larvae/settlers rather than directly producing adults.

Chosen single improvement
Introduce a two-compartment COTS population: juveniles (unobserved) and adults (observed). Adults produce recruits into the juvenile pool; juveniles survive and mature to adults with an annual probability. The effective transition to adults is capped by available habitat (carrying capacity Kc determined by coral cover), which regulates the boom’s ceiling and accelerates the bust as coral declines.

Ecological and mathematical details
- Per-capita recruitment: rC = rC_max * epsilon_food * I_sat * T_perf * Allee(C_adults), unchanged in form but now interpreted as recruits per adult, entering the juvenile pool.
- Juvenile dynamics:
  J_survive = J_prev * exp(-mJ_base)
  Mature = p_mat * J_survive
  Mature_eff = Mature * max(0, 1 - Adults_prev / Kc_prev)
  J_next = J_survive - Mature + Recruit + gamma_imm * Immigration_t
- Adult dynamics:
  Adults_survive = Adults_prev * exp(-mC_base)
  Adults_next = Adults_survive + Mature_eff
- Immigration now augments the juvenile pool (larvae/settlers), which is more realistic.
- Coral dynamics and COTS predation on coral are unchanged, preserving selective pressure on fast coral and the negative feedback that causes collapses.

Expected effects
- A realistic developmental delay (controlled by p_mat) sharpens and delays adult peaks, improving outbreak timing and magnitude.
- Habitat-limited maturation tightens the linkage between coral state and adult abundance, strengthening the bust dynamics after heavy predation/bleaching.

Parameter additions (with suggested bounds)
- mJ_base (year^-1): juvenile baseline mortality. Suggested bounds: 0.2–6.0; expected > adult mortality.
- p_mat (0–1): annual probability of maturation from juvenile to adult. Suggested bounds: 0.05–0.9.
- gamma_imm: reinterpreted to add to juveniles; no numeric change required.

Notes
- No data leakage is introduced; only previous states are used; exogenous drivers (SST, immigration) remain at time t.
- Please provide the residuals file to validate improvements and refine priors/bounds if necessary.
