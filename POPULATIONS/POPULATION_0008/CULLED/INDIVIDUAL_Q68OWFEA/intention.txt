Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model adequately captures the boom‐bust cycles of COTS but overlooks an important ecological process: the Allee effect in coral recovery. When coral cover is very low, recruitment and recovery may be significantly impaired, sustaining the outbreak conditions. To address this, we introduce a non-linear recovery term that multiplies the recovery rate by a function of the previous time step’s coral cover. This change should help the model better represent the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
