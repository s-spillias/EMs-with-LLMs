Assessment:
The current model captures general dynamics but underestimates the outbreak threshold and the intensity of the burst phase as indicated by systematic residual patterns during outbreaks.

Improvement:
We have modified the predation function from a Holling type II (hyperbolic) response to a Holling type III (sigmoidal) response. This change reflects that low coral cover yields minimal predation until a threshold is surpassed, triggering rapid starfish population outbreaks. This formulation better matches observed boom-bust cycles by incorporating nonlinear, density-dependent predation dynamics.

Justification:
The sigmoidal response captures the switching behavior in predation efficiency, aligning with empirical observations in the Great Barrier Reef. By reflecting low predation at low coral cover and rapid escalation at higher cover, the model more accurately predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
