Below is our proposal based on your instructions. We have decided to improve the ecological realism by modifying the predation function in the COTS dynamics. Currently, the model uses a Holling type II (hyperbolic) functional response. However, ecological evidence of outbreak events suggests that a sigmoidal (Holling type III) functional response better captures the low   
predation efficiency at low coral cover and the rapid increase once coral cover exceeds a threshold. This change will help the model better predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks observed in the data.                                                                                                                                                             

Changes proposed:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

 1 intention.txt: Update the assessment and reasoning to document the ecological rationale for switching from a Holling type II to a Holling type III response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 2 model.cpp: Modify the COTS dynamics prediction by replacing the current Holling type II term with a Holling type III term. The new formulation uses squared values (i.e., pow(fast_pred(t-1), 2) and pow(slow_pred(t-1), 2)) in the numerator and squares of the half-saturation constants in the denominator so that low coral abundances have less predation impact until a       
   threshold is reached.

 The current model captures general dynamics but underestimates the outbreak threshold and the intensity of the burst phase as indicated by systematic residual patterns during outbreaks.

 We have modified the predation function from a Holling type II (hyperbolic) response to a Holling type III (sigmoidal) response. This change reflects that low coral cover yields minimal predation until a threshold is surpassed, triggering rapid starfish population outbreaks. This formulation better matches observed boom-bust cycles by incorporating nonlinear,             
 density-dependent predation dynamics.

 The sigmoidal response captures the switching behavior in predation efficiency, aligning with empirical observations in the Great Barrier Reef. By reflecting low predation at low coral cover and rapid escalation at higher cover, the model more accurately predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
