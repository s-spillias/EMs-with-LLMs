Assessment and motivation for one ecological improvement

Context and goals
- Project focuses on episodic COTS outbreaks (rapid boom to outbreak densities followed by busts) driven by selective coral predation and environment.
- Mechanisms that trigger and sustain boom phases, and rapid collapses when prey are depleted, are essential to capture.

1) Model fit assessment
- Residuals file not included in the provided files, so I could not perform a direct quantitative assessment. If you share it, I can refine the diagnostics and verify targeted improvements.
- Structural check suggests a likely underprediction of outbreak peaks and overly muted booms. Reason:
  • With the current parameterization, baseline COTS mortality is high (mC_base ≈ 1.28 yr^-1).
  • Maximum effective per-capita growth before density regulation is bounded by rC_max * ε_food * I_sat * T_perf * Allee ≤ 3.0 * 0.4 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.2 yr^-1.
  • Even at ideal food, temperature, and without Allee limitation, rC cannot exceed mortality (1.2 < 1.28), and logistic regulation further reduces growth as C increases.
  • This makes it difficult to generate rapid positive growth needed for outbreak peaks unless immigration is unusually strong, leading to systematic negative residuals during observed peaks and shorter-than-observed outbreak durations.

2) Alignment with project context
- The model includes:
  • Selective coral predation via a multi-prey Holling functional response (Type II/III via q).
  • Food limitation via I_sat and carrying capacity Kc that depends on coral cover.
  • An Allee effect in reproduction, and temperature-dependent performance.
  • Coral bleaching effects on coral mortality and growth suppression.
- Missing for outbreak realism:
  • Food-dependent adult/late-juvenile survival: survival should increase when prey are abundant (and decline when prey are depleted). Currently, mortality is constant (mC_base), so the model cannot express high-survival, high-growth phases once prey are plentiful.
  • Known episodic drivers (e.g., flood-driven nutrient pulses increasing larval survival) are not explicitly modeled; only SST is included.

3) Key ecological processes potentially missing/oversimplified
- Mortality process: Constant mC_base likely over-simplifies survival dynamics; evidence suggests food availability modifies survival (both via condition and reduced risky foraging).
- Stage structure: Outbreaks are strongly recruitment-driven, but a single-compartment COTS state lumps life stages.
- Environmental stochasticity/pulses (nutrients/plankton) not explicitly included; SST-only modifier may miss key outbreak triggers.
- Feedback from coral depletion to COTS collapse exists via food limitation, but mortality escalation when food is scarce is not modeled.

Parameter review and implications
- T_bleach is updated from literature (31.75 °C), which reduces frequent bleaching penalties; this is appropriate.
- mC_base uses a literature-based high value, which is biologically reasonable for resource-poor phases but suppresses boom potential when used as a constant term.
- Given these updates, the original equation structure (constant mortality) becomes inconsistent with observed boom-bust dynamics. A food-modulated mortality term restores ecological realism while preserving the literature baseline as the low-food limit.

Chosen single improvement: Food-dependent reduction in COTS mortality
- Approach: Environmental modifier of a process (mortality).
- Rationale: When coral prey are abundant, per-capita intake is high, improving body condition and reducing risk-prone foraging, which lowers mortality. When prey are depleted, mortality rises toward the literature baseline, aiding busts. This single modification promotes rapid booms and sharp busts using existing prey feedbacks.
- Mathematical form (saturating reduction; safe, bounded, and simple):
  • Define I_sat = I_per_pred / (K_food + I_per_pred), already computed in the model (0..1).
  • Replace constant mortality with mC_eff = mC_base / (1 + k_m_food * I_sat), k_m_food ≥ 0.
  • Update COTS step: C_t = C_{t-1} + rC*C_{t-1}*(1 - C_{t-1}/Kc) - mC_eff*C_{t-1} + γ_imm*IMM_t.
- Ecological interpretation:
  • k_m_food controls the strength of survival improvement with high food. At I_sat ≈ 1, mortality is reduced by a factor 1/(1 + k_m_food).
  • When coral is scarce (I_sat ≈ 0), mC_eff ≈ mC_base, so collapses are retained.

Expected effect on fit and dynamics
- Increased ability to reach outbreak magnitudes and sustain peaks when prey are abundant (reduces negative residuals at peak years).
- Faster post-peak collapse as prey declines, improving bust timing and magnitude.
- Minimal added complexity: one new parameter, bounded, with a clear ecological role.

Implementation details
- New parameter: k_m_food (dimensionless), prior bounds: [0, 10], initial value 3.0 (tuneable). Penalty bounds added like other parameters.
- No data leakage: I_sat depends only on previous-step states (F_prev, S_prev, C_prev), not on current observations.
- All other processes unchanged.

Next steps
- Please provide the residuals file to validate these expectations quantitatively and assess whether further refinements (e.g., nutrient pulse driver or stage structure) are warranted after refitting.
