Assessment:
The residual analysis indicates that the current model overestimates coral recovery during periods of high sea surface temperature (SST) events. Ecologically, marine heatwaves and associated bleaching events impair coral regeneration. To address this, we introduce an environmental modifier on coral recovery. Specifically, when SST (from the previous time step) exceeds 28°C, coral recovery is reduced by a factor that depends on a new parameter, "coral_temp_sensitivity". This parameter quantifies the sensitivity of coral recovery to high SST stress, thereby capturing more accurately the boom‐bust dynamics observed during COTS outbreaks.
