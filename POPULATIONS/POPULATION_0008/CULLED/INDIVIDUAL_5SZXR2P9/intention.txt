Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
1. The model currently captures outbreak dynamics with a constant conversion efficiency (modulated by predator interference) but does not consider that COTS predation efficiency is likely limited by available coral resources.
2. In nature, low coral cover may reduce the efficiency of converting predation into starfish growth, while at high coral cover, this efficiency saturates.
3. To better reflect the ecological dynamics of COTS outbreaks, we add a resource limitation mechanism by modulating efficiency with total coral cover using a new half-saturation parameter (K_coral).
4. This modification enhances the model's ability to capture boom-bust cycles by linking predation efficiency to prey availability, aligning with the system dynamics outlined in the project context.
