Below is the plan for our ecological improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

Assessment & Reasoning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

 1 The current model uses predator interference via a density‐dependent decay term on efficiency (cots_efficiency_decay) but assumes a constant conversion efficiency regardless of coral availability.                                                                                                                                                                                
 2 Ecologically, predation efficiency should also be limited by prey (coral) availability. When coral cover is low, conversion efficiency should be reduced because starfish have fewer resources, and when coral cover is high, efficiency should saturate.                                                                                                                           
 3 Thus, we add a resource limitation mechanism by modulating efficiency with the total coral cover via a new half-saturation parameter (K_coral). This change avoids using current time step _dat values and only relies on previous predictions.

 1. The model currently captures outbreak dynamics with a constant conversion efficiency (modulated by predator interference) but does not consider that COTS predation efficiency is likely limited by available coral resources.                                                                                                                                                     
 2. In nature, low coral cover may reduce the efficiency of converting predation into starfish growth, while at high coral cover, this efficiency saturates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 3. To better reflect the ecological dynamics of COTS outbreaks, we add a resource limitation mechanism by modulating efficiency with total coral cover using a new half-saturation parameter (K_coral).                                                                                                                                                                               
 4. This modification enhances the model's ability to capture boom-bust cycles by linking predation efficiency to prey availability, aligning with the system dynamics outlined in the project context.
