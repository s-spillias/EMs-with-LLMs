Below is the proposed refactoring that implements a nonlinear resource‐limitation mechanism by introducing a new parameter (log_coral_feedback_exponent) that controls the nonlinear scaling (via a power function) of the predicted coral cover in modulating COTS predation efficiency. This change is ecologically justified because it better captures how small differences in    
coral availability can disproportionately affect outbreak dynamics (i.e. when coral is moderately abundant, even subtle differences may lead to large changes in predation impact), and it preserves the use of only previous time‐step values in forecasting.

 The current model represents outbreak dynamics using linear predation feedback modulated by coral cover. However, ecological observations suggest that the influence of coral availability on COTS outbreak dynamics may be highly nonlinear. Small changes in coral cover could trigger disproportionately large effects on predation efficiency. To better capture this             
 resource‐limitation and feedback mechanism, we are introducing a nonlinear coral feedback exponent. This parameter – implemented as log_coral_feedback_exponent and transformed to coral_feedback_exponent in the model – allows the predation efficiency to respond in a higher‐order (nonlinear) manner to coral cover. A value of zero (i.e. an exponent of 1) will recover the    
 original linear behavior, while positive values amplify the sensitivity, leading to more abrupt transitions. This change is expected to improve the timing, magnitude, and duration predictions of the outbreak cycles.

After applying these edits, you can compile the model as usual. To test the improvements, consider running your simulation and comparing the residuals to assess how the nonlinear feedback improves the model’s fit for outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.                                                                                                                     

Below is a suggested shell command to run the model simulation (adjust the command as per your build system):
