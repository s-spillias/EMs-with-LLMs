Assessment and Revision:
The current model represents outbreak dynamics using linear predation feedback modulated by coral cover. However, ecological observations suggest that the influence of coral availability on COTS outbreak dynamics may be highly nonlinear. Small changes in coral cover could trigger disproportionately large effects on predation efficiency. To better capture this resource‐limitation and feedback mechanism, we are introducing a nonlinear coral feedback exponent. This parameter – implemented as log_coral_feedback_exponent and transformed to coral_feedback_exponent in the model – allows the predation efficiency to respond in a higher‐order (nonlinear) manner to coral cover. A value of zero (i.e. an exponent of 1) will recover the original linear behavior, while positive values amplify the sensitivity, leading to more abrupt transitions. This change is expected to improve the timing, magnitude, and duration predictions of the outbreak cycles.
