Assessment:
The current model estimates COTS outbreak dynamics using a simple threshold mechanism that only considers whether coral cover is above or below a fixed value, resulting in a binary (sign) response. This does not adequately capture the resource limitation in predation of coral by COTS.
Improvement:
Introduce a saturating (Holling type II) functional response in the predation term. Specifically, modify the term so that the growth contribution from coral availability follows:
  (attack_rate * coral) / (K + coral)
This better reflects that an increase in coral cover does not indefinitely boost COTS growth since predation efficiency saturates. Two new parameters (K_fast and K_slow) are added to represent the half-saturation constants for fast- and slow-growing coral, respectively.
