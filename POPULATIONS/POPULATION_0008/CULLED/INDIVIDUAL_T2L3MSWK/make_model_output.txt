Below are the proposed changes. We are introducing a saturating (Holling type II) functional response for the conversion of coral cover into COTS growth. This change provides a more balanced resource‐limitation mechanism by accounting for reduced additional benefit when coral cover gets very high. In our assessment we noted that while the current model uses a simple       
threshold (via a sign function) to modulate predation effects, a saturating response is more ecologically realistic. This approach (1) prevents the conversion term from increasing indefinitely with coral cover and (2) better captures the dynamics of outbreak and bust phases in COTS populations. Consequently, we add two new parameters (K_fast and K_slow) with clear         
ecological justification in parameters.json, update the parameter section in model.cpp, remove the older “smooth threshold” resource signals, and modify the COTS update equation accordingly.

 The current model estimates COTS outbreak dynamics using a simple threshold mechanism that only considers whether coral cover is above or below a fixed value, resulting in a binary (sign) response. This does not adequately capture the resource limitation in predation of coral by COTS.

 Introduce a saturating (Holling type II) functional response in the predation term. Specifically, modify the term so that the growth contribution from coral availability follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                    
   (attack_rate * coral) / (K + coral)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 This better reflects that an increase in coral cover does not indefinitely boost COTS growth since predation efficiency saturates. Two new parameters (K_fast and K_slow) are added to represent the half-saturation constants for fast- and slow-growing coral, respectively.
