Assessment & Improvement:
The current model captures the boom‐bust dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish outbreaks; however, the efficiency converting predation effects to COTS growth is static. In reality, this efficiency should be modulated by coral availability – when coral is abundant, starfish may convert predation more effectively, while under scarcity efficiency decreases. To capture this dynamic, we now introduce a variable efficiency term that is a saturating function of the total coral cover. We add a new parameter, "half_saturation_coral", that defines the coral cover at which the effective efficiency is half of its maximum. This added complexity is ecologically justified as it better represents resource‐limited predation and prey switching behaviors in coral reef systems.
