Assessment of current model and justification for changes

1) Fit to data
- A residuals file was referenced but not provided in this context, so a quantitative evaluation of fit (timing, peak magnitude, and duration of outbreaks) cannot be completed here. Please supply residuals so we can identify whether misfit concentrates in the timing of outbreak onset, peak amplitudes, duration, or the post-peak decay phase.
- Structurally, the model can generate boom-bust cycles via interplay among food limitation (coral cover), temperature gating of reproduction, carrying capacity tied to coral, immigration, and an Allee effect. However, the current Allee specification may be too gradual to reproduce abrupt outbreak initiation commonly observed in broadcast spawners like COTS.

2) Relevance to the project context
- The model includes selective predation on fast (Acropora) and slow (Faviidae + Porites) coral, bleaching impacts on corals, a flexible (Type II/III) multi-prey functional response, and COTS demography with food- and temperature-dependent reproduction, a one-year memory (lag_recruit), and immigration. These are all consistent with outbreak ecology.
- Outbreaks of COTS are often episodic and exhibit threshold-like behavior: below a density threshold, mate limitation suppresses reproduction; above it, fertilization success and aggregation drive rapid population growth. The current Allee formulation A(C) = C/(A50 + C) is monotone but shallow, potentially underestimating this threshold effect.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Mate limitation and aggregation: The Allee effect is present but likely oversimplified (linear Hill exponent of 1). Empirical and theoretical work for broadcast spawners supports a steeper, non-linear fertilization vs density curve.
- Multi-year developmental delays and nutrient-pulse-mediated larval survival are also important but would require additional states or external drivers. To keep complexity manageable and avoid data leakage, the first, most impactful refinement is to strengthen the nonlinearity of the existing Allee component.

Chosen single ecological improvement

Introduce a Hill-type Allee effect by adding a shape exponent parameter nu_Allee >= 1:
A(C) = C^nu_Allee / (A50^nu_Allee + C^nu_Allee)

Rationale:
- Ecological: Broadcast spawning and aggregation behavior imply strongly non-linear fertilization success with adult density. A steeper Allee effect provides a clearer reproductive threshold, enabling more realistic episodic outbreaks (rapid onset once a threshold is crossed) while preventing spurious growth at low density.
- Mathematical: This is a minimal change that generalizes the existing form and preserves it when nu_Allee = 1. It adds only one parameter and minimal computational overhead, yet can materially improve outbreak timing and magnitude.
- Identifiability/estimation: With time series that include multiple booms and busts, nu_Allee should be estimable within reasonable bounds. If data are weak, bounds can be tightened or nu_Allee fixed to a literature-informed value.

Implementation details
- Added new parameter nu_Allee (dimensionless) with suggested bounds [1, 6]; initial value 2.0.
- In model.cpp, replaced the Allee term with a Hill function:
  Allee_m = C_prev^nu_Allee / (A50^nu_Allee + C_prev^nu_Allee)
- Added a smooth penalty to keep nu_Allee within its plausible range (consistent with the existing soft-bound approach).
- All prediction calculations continue to depend only on previous time step states (no data leakage). Initial state uses t=0 observations as before.

Notes and next steps when residuals are available
- If residuals show:
  - Outbreak peaks are delayed or under-amplified: expect nu_Allee > 1 to improve timing and peak magnitude.
  - Outbreaks persist too long: consider moderate increases to mC_base or sharper coral-feedback on Kc after coral depletion; or introduce a slightly higher q_func if predation saturation is too weak.
  - Multiple-year delays are seen: consider extending the recruitment memory beyond 1 year or introducing an explicit juvenile state in a future iteration.

Parameter review
- Provided parameters mainly list “initial estimate” sources; updated_from_literature is false for all entries, so no conflicting literature-driven updates are indicated here.
- The added nu_Allee parameter is grounded in broadcast spawning theory and is intended to replace the oversimplified (nu=1) Allee form with a more realistic steepness control.

Data request
- Please provide the residuals file referenced in the instructions so we can validate whether this change addresses the most prominent lack-of-fit patterns and tune bounds/priors accordingly.
