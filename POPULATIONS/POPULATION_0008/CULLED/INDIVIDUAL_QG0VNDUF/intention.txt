Assessment:
- The current model captures the basic COTS and coral interactions using logistic-style COTS growth and saturating predation.
- However, the quadratic representation of SST effects may oversimplify the non-linear, asymmetric impacts of extreme temperature events.
- In particular, the rapid escalation during extreme SST deviations may not be fully captured.

Improvement:
- Introduce an additional cubic term in the SST modifier, controlled by a new parameter `sst_cubic_coef`, to account for higher-order, asymmetric effects of extreme SST deviations.
- This adjustment is ecologically justified as extreme SST events can disproportionately affect both COTS physiology and coral health, influencing the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events.
