The model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. 
It captures boom‐bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase due to a combination of favorable environmental conditions (e.g., increased sea surface temperature and larval immigration) 
and then decline due to density‐dependent mortality and resource limitation. The model incorporates the selective predation effects of COTS on fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites coral species, 
using saturating functional responses and threshold-based resource limitations. Feedback loops between coral recovery and COTS dynamics are modeled, ensuring that only past population values drive future predictions, thereby avoiding data leakage.
