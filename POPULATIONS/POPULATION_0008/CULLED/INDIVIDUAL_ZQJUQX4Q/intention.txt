Assessment and Improvement:
----------------------------------
After evaluating the model’s fit to the data and the residuals, we note that while the current model captures outbreak dynamics through logistic COTS growth modulated by coral predation, it may oversimplify the ecological feedbacks. In particular, when coral cover is abundant, there could be a non‐linear enhancement in the efficiency with which predation conversion occurs (e.g., via improved larval survival or facilitation mechanisms).
To better capture these dynamics, we introduce a new parameter `beta_efficiency` that governs a quadratic (polynomial) enhancement in the effective efficiency calculation. This addition allows the model to represent threshold-like dynamics where high coral cover leads to disproportionately higher efficiency, which in turn can help trigger the rapid rise seen in outbreak events.
This improvement is ecologically justified as it represents additional complexity in the feedback mechanisms driving the episodic outbreaks of COTS.
