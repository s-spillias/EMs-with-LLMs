Assessment of current model

Fit to data (based on available information)
- Quantitative residual analysis could not be performed because the residuals file was not provided. Please share it to evaluate bias, autocorrelation, phase error (timing of peaks), and amplitude mismatch (outbreak magnitude).
- Qualitative expectations:
  - If residuals for COTS show positive autocorrelation and phase lag (peaks predicted too early/late), it suggests insufficient recruitment delay memory.
  - If residuals for coral show systematic underestimation during recovery after outbreaks, growth suppression or space limitation may be too strong, or predation too persistent.
  - If logit residuals for coral cluster near boundaries, the logit-normal with stability clips is appropriate but could signal missing covariates (e.g., storm damage, diseases).

Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths:
  - Captures COTS–coral predator-prey coupling with multi-prey functional response (Type II/III via exponent q).
  - Includes Allee effect on COTS reproduction, outbreak immigration driver, and temperature-modulated reproductive performance.
  - Ties COTS carrying capacity to coral availability, supporting boom-bust cycles as prey is depleted.
  - Uses hazard-based predation removal preventing overconsumption, improving realism at low coral cover.
- Potential shortcomings relative to episodic outbreaks:
  - Recruitment delay is modeled with only a 1-year lag. Empirical evidence suggests juveniles are cryptic for 1–3 years, and outbreaks often reflect multi-cohort accumulation. A single lag can mis-time outbreak onset and underestimate duration.
  - No explicit runoff/nutrient driver for larval survival; this is a known trigger but not available as data here. Immigration is included but may not fully substitute local larval survival pulses.
  - Single broad Gaussian thermal performance may miss asymmetry; however, this is likely adequate unless residuals show temperature-related skew.

Ecological processes possibly missing or oversimplified
- Stage/age structure and cryptic juveniles (1–3 years) are not explicitly represented; approximated via a single lag.
- No explicit nutrient/runoff or plankton productivity driver for larval survival (data-limited).
- Predator control/removal or targeted culling is not modeled (could be added if data exist).
- Constant background mortality for COTS; density- or environment-dependent mortality is not modeled.

Parameter review
- Values fall within plausible ranges and have soft penalties aligning with parameters.json bounds.
- lag_recruit = 0.8 indicates strong reliance on previous year conditions for recruitment, consistent with delayed maturation but potentially over-concentrated at 1 year.
- mC_base (≈1.28 yr^-1) and rC_max (3 yr^-1) allow for boom-bust given sufficient food and immigration coupling.
- T_bleach and heat sensitivities are plausible; bleaching effects suppress coral growth and increase mortality appropriately.

Chosen improvement: two-year recruitment memory (delayed density dependence)
- Rationale: COTS juveniles typically require 1–3 years to mature; outbreaks often build through multiple strong cohorts. Extending the recruitment driver to incorporate a 2-year lag helps capture timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks while keeping the model parsimonious and data-leakage safe.
- Mathematical implementation:
  - Compute food-temperature index f_t = I_sat_t × T_perf_t, where I_sat_t is the saturating per-predator intake and T_perf_t is thermal performance (already present).
  - Build a normalized mixture of current and lagged indices:
      w0, w1, w2 ≥ 0 and w0 + w1 + w2 = 1
      w0 ∝ max(ε, 1 − lag_recruit − lag_recruit2)
      w1 ∝ max(ε, lag_recruit)
      w2 ∝ max(ε, lag_recruit2)
      food_temp_mix = w0 f_t + w1 f_{t−1} + w2 f_{t−2}
  - Replace the previous two-term blend with this three-term mixture.
  - Seed the 2-year lag at t=0 (uses predicted state from t=0) to avoid data leakage; at t=1 the 2-year term equals the 1-year term.
- Expected effects:
  - Reduces phase error (improves timing) when outbreaks lag favorable conditions by >1 year.
  - Allows longer elevated recruitment, supporting sustained outbreak plateau before bust.
  - Retains identifiability via soft normalization and bounded parameters.

Future directions (if residuals indicate)
- If strong nutrient/runoff signals are evident, add an external larval survival driver.
- If outbreaks terminate too slowly, consider density-dependent COTS mortality or predator aggregation.
- If temperature effects are asymmetric, consider skewed thermal performance.

Please provide the residuals file to complete the quantitative fit assessment and to refine weights or consider further structural changes.
