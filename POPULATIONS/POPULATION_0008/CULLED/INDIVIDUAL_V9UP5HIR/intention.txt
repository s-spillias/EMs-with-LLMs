1. This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. COTS populations undergo a characteristic boom-bust cycle whereby their numbers rapidly surge to outbreak levels and then decline.
3. The model captures resource limitations through saturating functions and threshold effects, and considers indirect feedback loops between coral cover and COTS dynamics.
4. Coral communities are split into fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing groups (Faviidae spp. and Porities spp.), with COTS selectively preying on these groups.
5. Environmental drivers (e.g., sea-surface temperature and larval immigration rates) modulate the timing and magnitude of outbreak events.
6. The model avoids data leakage by using only past state values to predict future states, ensuring robust forecasts of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
