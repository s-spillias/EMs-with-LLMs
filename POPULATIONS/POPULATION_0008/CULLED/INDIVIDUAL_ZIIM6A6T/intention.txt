Assessment:
The current model successfully captures key elements such as density‐dependence and environmental modifications via SST deviations on COTS outbreaks. However, it uses a constant conversion efficiency for predation effects, which oversimplifies the ecological reality that reduced coral cover limits food availability for Crown of Thorns starfish.
To address this, we have introduced a resource limitation mechanism that scales the efficiency based on the combined availability of fast- and slow-growing coral (normalized by 200). This modification reflects that when coral cover is depleted, the effective conversion of coral predation into starfish growth is reduced, helping to more accurately capture the boom–bust dynamics observed in outbreak events.
