After evaluating the model and its residuals, there is evidence of slight systematic bias.
The current formulation does not capture a key ecological feedback: as coral (both fast- and slow-growing) is heavily predated upon, the effective predation pressure on the remaining coral should decrease.
To address this, we introduce a variable efficiency term that scales the starfish's effective predation efficiency by the available coral cover.
This adjustment (adding a coral scaling factor) better represents the resource limitation mechanism in the ecosystem and should improve the modelâ€™s ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events.
