Assessment & Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
The current model uses a simple linear modifier for the effect of SST on the COTS growth rate. However, temperature responses in coral reef ecosystems are often non‐linear, with threshold effects that can suddenly trigger outbreaks. In our improvement, we replace the linear modifier with a quadratic function that can capture these non-linear responses. Two new parameters, 
sst_lin and sst_quad, are added. The linear term helps preserve a baseline effect while the quadratic term captures threshold or tipping behaviors. This should provide a more realistic simulation of when and how environmental temperature deviations trigger COTS outbreaks.                                                                                                       

We will make the following changes:

 The current model applies a linear modifier for the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) growth. However, ecological evidence suggests that SST impacts are often nonlinear, with threshold behaviors that may trigger abrupt outbreak events.

 We introduce a quadratic component to the SST modifier. This addition, with new parameters "sst_lin" and "sst_quad", allows the model to capture both baseline (linear) effects and additional nonlinear (quadratic) responses to temperature deviations from the ideal 26°C. This enhancement supports better predictions of the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks   
 while avoiding data leakage by using only previous time step SST values.
