Assessment:
The current model applies a linear modifier for the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) growth. However, ecological evidence suggests that SST impacts are often nonlinear, with threshold behaviors that may trigger abrupt outbreak events.

Improvement:
We introduce a quadratic component to the SST modifier. This addition, with new parameters "sst_lin" and "sst_quad", allows the model to capture both baseline (linear) effects and additional nonlinear (quadratic) responses to temperature deviations from the ideal 26Â°C. This enhancement supports better predictions of the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks while avoiding data leakage by using only previous time step SST values.
