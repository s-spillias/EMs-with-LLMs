Assessment and fixes:
- Brought model.cpp further in line with TMB conventions and eliminated triggers for data leakage/validation penalties.
- Addressed earlier constant-prediction issue by:
  1) Switching coral crowding from a high-power free-space term to a logistic-style crowding modifier: growth ∝ (1 - (F+S)/K_space)^beta_space. This avoids near-zero growth when coral is close to K_space and allows variability driven by environmental modifiers and predation.
  2) Incorporating an exogenous immigration driver for COTS (cotsimm_dat) scaled by gamma_imm. This supports episodic influxes consistent with larval supply pulses and prevents trivial extinction dynamics that produced constant coral predictions.

- Maintained core ecological structure:
  - Two coral functional groups (fast Acropora and slow Faviidae/Porites) limited by space (K_space) and impacted by heat stress via growth suppression (heat_sens_F/S) and bleaching mortality (m_bleach_max) driven by a logistic function of SST relative to T_bleach with slope bleach_slope.
  - COTS population dynamics include resource-dependent reproduction (thermal performance around Topt, Allee effect A50, saturating food-efficiency epsilon_food with half-saturation K_food), resource-dependent carrying capacity Kc = Kc0 + kCF*F + kCS*S, and starvation mortality mC_starv_max scaling with free-space fraction.

- Predictions and units:
  - fast_pred and slow_pred are now reported in percent (0–100) to match input data units and downstream plotting.
  - Likelihood for coral converts observed percent to proportions before applying a logit-normal error model; predicted means for coral use the internal state proportions (F, S). This avoids unit mismatches and data leakage.

- Exogenous driver:
  - Added cotsimm_dat as an exogenous input. Immigration is added to the COTS update at each step: C_{t+1} = C_t + births - deaths + gamma_imm * cotsimm_dat_t.

- Data leakage safeguards: Observed responses (cots_dat, fast_dat, slow_dat) are used only in the likelihood. Process equations use only previous-step predicted states and exogenous drivers (sst_dat, cotsimm_dat), preventing leakage.

Parameter bounds:
- Bound penalties unchanged and remain aligned with parameters.json, including literature-updated ranges for T_bleach [29.0, 34.5] and mC_base [0.0013, 2.56]. The new use of gamma_imm is already bounded [0, 10].

Notes:
- These changes should eliminate the NA objective (from constant predictions) and produce more realistic variability and boom-bust dynamics by allowing immigration-driven booms and resource/space feedbacks to drive busts.
- If residual diagnostics suggest alternative crowding exponents or functional response forms (e.g., varying q_func), these can be tuned within current structure without introducing leakage.
