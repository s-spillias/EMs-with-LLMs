Assessment:
1. The current model adequately captures outbreak dynamics but uses a fixed conversion efficiency (modulated only by predator density).
2. Ecologically, prey (coral) availability should also influence the efficiency of converting predation into growthâ€”low coral reduces efficiency while moderate levels enhance it until predator interference dominates.
3. To reflect these dynamics, we introduce a variable efficiency term using a saturating (exponential) function of total coral cover (fast + slow), which is computed solely from previous time step values.
