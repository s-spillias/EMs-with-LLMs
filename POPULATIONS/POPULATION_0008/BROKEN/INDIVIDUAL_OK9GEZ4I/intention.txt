Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures the burst-and-decline dynamics of COTS outbreaks, but it lacks an explicit resource limitation mechanism linking coral availability to COTS growth. In the current formulation, the intrinsic growth of COTS is independent of the prey (coral) density, which may lead to unrealistic outbreak persistence.
Improvement:
Incorporate a coral-dependent resource limitation in the COTS growth equation by scaling the growth term with the available coral cover (the sum of fast and slow coral predictions). This feedback mechanism captures the ecological observation that outbreaks are fueled when prey (coral) are abundant and self-limit as coral resources decline.
