Assessment:
-----------
The current model uses a linear SST effect (i.e. sst_effect*(sst_dat - 26)) for triggering COTS outbreak dynamics, which may be too simplistic given the complex environmental drivers of outbreaks. Analysis of the residuals indicates that the model underestimates the rapid onset of population explosions when SST exceeds typical background levels. 

Chosen Improvement:
-------------------
Introduce a non-linear (power-law) response to SST by incorporating an SST threshold parameter and an exponent. When SST is above this threshold, the outbreak trigger increases non-linearly. This approach better captures the sudden environmental shifts that drive epidemic COTS outbreaks, aligning with our project objectives to accurately model the timing, magnitude, and duration of these events.

New Parameters Added:
- sst_threshold: The minimum SST (Â°C) above which outbreak dynamics are triggered.
- sst_exponent: Controls the non-linear amplification of outbreak dynamics as SST increases beyond the threshold.

Ecological Rationale:
---------------------
Ecosystem responses to thermal stress are often non-linear, with abrupt transitions when critical thresholds are exceeded. By adding these parameters, the model now dynamically captures the intensified outbreak response driven by extreme SST values, while avoiding data leakage by only using past SST data.
