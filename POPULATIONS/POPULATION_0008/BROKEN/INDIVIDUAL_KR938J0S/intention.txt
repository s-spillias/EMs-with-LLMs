Assessment and Proposed Improvement:
--------------------------------------
The current model captures the basic boom‐bust dynamics and uses coral cover to modulate COTS outbreak magnitude via a linear effect. However, ecological evidence suggests that the efficiency of coral consumption by COTS saturates as coral abundance increases (a Michaelis–Menten type response). This improvement introduces resource limitation through saturating dynamics, better capturing the real-world nonlinear ecological interactions.
We add two new parameters:
 • beta_fast: Saturation parameter for the effect of fast-growing coral (Acropora) on COTS dynamics.
 • beta_slow: Saturation parameter for the effect of slow-growing coral (Faviidae and Porites) on COTS dynamics.
This change should improve the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks by incorporating indirect feedback mechanisms from coral availability.
