Assessment and Ecological Improvement:

1. The current model captures boom-bust dynamics but models coral predation as a linear function of COTS abundance,
   which may oversimplify the selective predation on coral communities.
2. To better represent ecological interactions, a saturating predation term (Michaelisâ€“Menten type) is introduced.
   This modification reflects that at high densities, COTS predation efficiency reaches a maximum.
3. Three new parameters are added:
   - p_fast: Maximum predation rate on fast-growing coral.
   - p_slow: Maximum predation rate on slow-growing coral.
   - cots_half_sat: Half-saturation constant that determines the density at which the predation effect is half its maximum.
4. These changes align with the project goal of accurately capturing outbreak timings, magnitudes, and the impact on coral communities.
