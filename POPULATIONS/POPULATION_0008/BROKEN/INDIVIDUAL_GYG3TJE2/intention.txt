My assessment indicates that while the current model captures the rapid outbreak and subsequent decline in COTS abundance, the linear coral recovery process likely oversimplifies the complex ecological dynamics. In natural reef ecosystems, recovery is expected to show diminishing returns as coral cover nears its maximum capacity (i.e. 100%). 

To address this, I have introduced a new parameter "r_exp" that exponentiates the proportional recovery gap. This non-linear formulation enables the recovery rate to decrease more steeply as coral cover increasesâ€”capturing resource limitation effects without data leakage (only previous time step values are used). This improvement will help the model better predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events.
