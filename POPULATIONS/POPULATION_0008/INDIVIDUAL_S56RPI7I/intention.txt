Assessment of the current model

Fit to data:
- A residuals file was referenced but not provided here, so I could not quantify fit, check autocorrelation, or identify systematic bias in prediction errors. Please share the residuals to refine this assessment.
- Structurally, the model is capable of generating outbreaks (via Type III functional response, immigration, and food/temperature-modulated COTS growth), but the post-peak crash mechanism is likely underpowered without direct mortality feedback from coral scarcity.

Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT:
- The model already includes:
  - Selective predation on fast vs slow coral using a multi-prey Holling disk response with q_func enabling Type III behavior.
  - Space-limited coral growth and temperature-induced bleaching effects that suppress coral growth and increase mortality.
  - COTS growth modulated by food (coral intake), temperature performance, Allee effects, carrying capacity linked to coral, and immigration.
- For reproducing characteristic boom-bust cycles, an explicit feedback where adult COTS mortality increases when coral cover is low is important. Currently, crash dynamics rely mainly on reduced growth (via Kc and food limitation) and constant baseline mortality, which can produce gradual rather than sharp declines.

Potentially missing or oversimplified processes:
- Starvation/condition-dependent adult mortality for COTS as prey becomes scarce (missing).
- Recruitment pulses driven by environmental factors (e.g., nutrient/runoff events) are not explicitly modeled and are proxied by a generic immigration input (present as external forcing but not mechanistically tied to environmental covariates here).
- Maturation delays (juvenile-to-adult time lags) are not explicitly represented.

Parameter review and consistency with literature:
- T_bleach and mC_base are marked updated_from_literature in parameters.json. The model previously used broad penalty ranges not aligned with these updates.
  - T_bleach: parameters.json bounds [29.0, 34.5] deg C with value 31.25. The code previously penalized [24.0, 32.0]. Updated in code to [29.0, 34.5].
  - mC_base: parameters.json bounds [0.0013, 2.56] with value ~1.28 yr^-1. The code previously used [0.0, 5.0]. Updated in code to [0.0013, 2.56].

Chosen improvement: Environmental modifier via prey-dependent (coral-dependent) starvation mortality for COTS
- Rationale:
  - Empirically, adult COTS survival declines when coral prey is scarce, contributing to rapid post-outbreak crashes.
  - The current model ties COTS reproduction and carrying capacity to coral, but survival remains largely baseline. This can delay or mute busts.
- Mathematical form:
  - Define total coral cover P_total = F_prev + S_prev (proportion 0–1).
  - Introduce an additional mortality term:
      mC_starv = mC_starv_max * K_starv / (K_starv + P_total)
    which:
      - approaches mC_starv_max as P_total → 0 (severe scarcity),
      - decreases monotonically as coral increases,
      - is simple, smooth, and AD-friendly.
  - Total adult mortality becomes mC_total = mC_base + mC_starv.
- Expected effects:
  - Sharper, more realistic declines after peaks when coral has been heavily consumed.
  - Better timing and duration of bust phases without destabilizing dynamics when coral is abundant (extra mortality is small then).
- Data usage and leakage:
  - The new term uses only predicted states from the previous time step (F_prev, S_prev) and thus respects the no data-leakage rule.

Notes for future refinement (pending residuals diagnostics):
- If residuals show lagged positive errors around peaks or prolonged declines, a juvenile stage or maturation delay could be added.
- If outbreaks align with known runoff/nutrient events, consider adding an environmental covariate to immigration or larval survival rather than a latent process.

Implementation summary:
- Added parameters mC_starv_max and K_starv with reasonable bounds.
- Subtracted mC_starv * C_prev from the COTS update.
- Updated parameter bound penalties for T_bleach and mC_base to match parameters.json literature bounds.
