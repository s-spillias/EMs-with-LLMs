PROJECT CONTEXT
Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) on the GBR, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions, while accounting for selective predation on corals (fast-growing Acropora and slower Faviidae/Porites). Key mechanisms include food- and temperature-modulated reproduction, Allee effects at low density, immigration pulses, and prey depletion leading to crash.

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL
Data fit
- The residuals file was referenced but not provided here, so a quantitative fit assessment (bias, autocorrelation, peak under/over-shoots) cannot be made at this time. Please provide the residuals so we can validate and potentially tune the proposed change.
- Qualitatively, the current structure tends to produce smoother COTS dynamics because adult COTS are updated via an additive logistic increment plus a constant mortality term. This can understate abrupt outbreak peaks and the sharpness of subsequent crashes, which are hallmark features of COTS dynamics.

Alignment with project context
- Strengths already present:
  - Selective predation on coral types with a flexible Type II/III functional response (q_func).
  - Temperature-driven bleaching that suppresses coral growth and adds mortality.
  - COTS reproduction is modulated by per-predator intake (food), thermal performance (Gaussian around Topt), and an Allee effect at low adult densities.
  - Immigration driver included.
  - Space limitation on coral with a cap (K_space) and shared crowding (beta_space).
- Potential limitations relative to the context:
  - Adult COTS regulation is additive logistic, which often yields gradual, not highly overcompensatory, dynamics. This may not capture the sharp outbreak peaks and busts.
  - No explicit time lag/stage structure (larval/juvenile vs adult), which can be important but would add considerable complexity.
  - Environmental modulation of COTS mortality is constant (mC_base), though reproduction is environment-modulated.

Processes potentially missing or oversimplified
- Overcompensatory density regulation in adult COTS (important for sharp boom-bust behavior).
- Stage structure and time lags (ecologically important but considerably more complex).
- Exogenous nutrient/flood pulses affecting larval survival (not available as a driver here).
- Density-dependent mortality/disease at high COTS density (could be another path, but redundant with overcompensation if implemented carefully).

PARAMETER REVIEW
- T_bleach was updated from literature (31.75°C). The bleaching function is a logistic centered at T_bleach with slope bleach_slope, which remains appropriate. Given many GBR sites seldom reach such high SSTs, bleaching may be occasional, which is consistent with the intended behavior.
- Most other parameters are initial estimates with plausible bounds. No scaling inconsistencies are introduced by the proposed structural change.
- No new parameters added; existing bounds remain in use for soft penalties.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT
Approach: Higher-order/non-linear density regulation for COTS adults via a Ricker-type update (overcompensatory growth).
Rationale:
- Ricker dynamics are widely used for outbreaking species because they allow sharp increases when conditions are favorable and rapid declines after peak due to overcompensation.
- The existing modifiers (food intake saturation, thermal performance, and Allee effect) remain intact and feed into rC. The change applies only to how rC is realized in population update.
- This adds no new parameters or data requirements and avoids data leakage (relies only on prior state and exogenous drivers).

MATHEMATICAL CHANGE
Previous (additive logistic + constant mortality):
- Kc = Kc0 + kCF*F_prev + kCS*S_prev
- deltaC = rC * C_prev * (1 - C_prev / Kc)
- C_next_raw = C_prev + deltaC - mC_base * C_prev + gamma_imm * IMM_t

New (Ricker/overcompensatory multiplicative update):
- Kc = Kc0 + kCF*F_prev + kCS*S_prev
- r_net = rC * (1 - C_prev / Kc) - mC_base
- C_next_raw = C_prev * exp(r_net) + gamma_imm * IMM_t

Implementation notes:
- Retains positivity via exp and the existing softplus applied to C_next_raw.
- Uses only previous-step states (C_prev, F_prev, S_prev) and exogenous inputs (SST_t, IMM_t), satisfying the “no data leakage” requirement.
- Preserves interpretation of rC as an effective per-capita growth rate after environmental and food modifiers and Allee effects.

EXPECTED EFFECT ON DYNAMICS
- Larger outbreak peaks when rC is high (favorable food/temperature, sufficient adults) and Kc is elevated by coral abundance.
- Sharper post-peak declines when C_prev overshoots Kc, improving the match to observed boom-bust cycles (pending residual validation).
- Immigration pulses continue to seed outbreaks but are expressed through an overcompensatory growth update, improving timing and magnitude of outbreaks when drivers align.

NEXT STEPS (optional upon residuals)
- Inspect residuals for peak timing and amplitude bias.
- If crashes remain too slow, consider modest density-dependent mortality (additional term) or time-lag/stage structure in a future iteration.
- If peaks overshoot unrealistically, adjust bounds or priors on rC_max, epsilon_food, or Kc scalars (kCF, kCS).

No changes to parameters.json are required for this iteration.
