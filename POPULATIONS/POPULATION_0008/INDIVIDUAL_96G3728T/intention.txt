Assessment:
The current model employs a linear SST-driven environmental modifier for COTS growth. However, residual analysis reveals that extreme deviations in sea surface temperature (SST) are associated with notable discrepancies between observed and predicted outbreaks. As COTS outbreaks tend to display sharp, episodic surges under extreme environmental conditions, a quadratic term in SST deviation is ecologically justified. 

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a quadratic term to the environmental modifier on growth rate to capture accelerated COTS growth during high anomaly events. This modification reflects the non-linear response of the COTS population to environmental stress.
