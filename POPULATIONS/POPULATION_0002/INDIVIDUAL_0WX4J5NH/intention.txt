ASSESSMENT AND PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT

Summary
- Data fit: A quantitative evaluation requires the residuals file, which was not provided in this context. Without it, I cannot numerically assess bias, autocorrelation, or heteroscedasticity in residuals. Please share the residuals to complete this analysis. Qualitatively, the model is structurally sound and includes observation models (lognormal/logit-normal) with SD floors to avoid numerical issues.
- Alignment with project context: The model targets boom–bust COTS dynamics using (i) temperature-modulated adult mortality, (ii) SST-anomaly-driven larval survival pulses, (iii) juvenile-adult stage structure with maturation delay, (iv) adaptive diet preference with saturating functional response, (v) density-dependent reproduction, and (vi) food limitation via coral cover. These are all key ingredients for outbreak timing and collapse.
- Potential oversimplifications:
  1) Coral bleaching is applied identically to fast and slow coral. Empirically, Acropora (fast) bleach/decline much more strongly than Faviidae/Porites (slow). Applying identical bleaching undercuts prey-composition realism during warm years and may weaken the negative feedback that triggers busts via food limitation.
  2) Juvenile processes use constant survival and maturation; in reality they can depend on environmental factors (nutrients, temperature, habitat). This is a viable future extension, but it adds state–environment coupling that is harder to identify without additional forcings.

Chosen single improvement: Coral-type-specific bleaching intensity
- Rationale: Warm years accelerate coral loss, especially for fast-growing Acropora. Faster loss of fast coral increases food limitation quickly for adults, raising mortality (through the existing food-dependent adult mortality term) and reducing fecundity, thereby sharpening the bust. This directly supports the project goal of capturing outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
- Minimal-complexity change: Split the maximum bleaching mortality magnitude into coral-type-specific parameters while retaining a shared SST threshold and smoothness (T_bleach, tau_bleach). This adds just two parameters and preserves identifiability better than introducing separate thresholds/slopes for each coral group at this stage.

Implementation details
- Parameters: Replace log_m_bleach with log_m_bleach_fast and log_m_bleach_slow (both with the same bounds as the original). Initial values are set to reflect higher susceptibility for fast coral (Acropora) than slow coral (Faviidae/Porites).
- Equations: The bleaching gate remains a logistic function of SST, but the applied magnitude differs by coral group:
  bleach_gate = inv_logit((sst - T_bleach)/tau_bleach)
  F_{t+1} ... - (m_bleach_fast * bleach_gate) * F_t
  S_{t+1} ... - (m_bleach_slow * bleach_gate) * S_t
- No use of current-time observations in process equations (unchanged). Only predictions and exogenous forcings drive the state updates.

What to look for in residuals after refit
- Fast coral residuals during warm years should shift toward less overprediction (previously too high if bleaching impact was under-estimated).
- Adult COTS residuals following warm anomalies should better capture the timing and sharpness of the bust due to faster food limitation.
- Diet-preference-related parameters should be better identified because prey composition responses to warming are more realistic.

Future (optional) extensions, if needed by residual diagnostics
- Temperature- or resource-dependent juvenile maturation/survival to sharpen outbreak timing after pulse years.
- Separate bleaching thresholds or transition widths by coral type if residuals indicate misfit during specific temperature ranges.
- Runoff/Chl-a-driven larval survival pulses to represent nutrient/runoff events, pending data availability.

Note on missing residuals
- To complete the requested “Evaluate how well the model fits the data” step rigorously (including bias and lag structure), please provide the residuals file. I will then finalize the assessment and, if necessary, adjust bounds/priors or functional forms based on the diagnostic patterns observed.
