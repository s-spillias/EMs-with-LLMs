Model Assessment and Improvements:

1. Current Issues:
- Fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics
- Overestimates coral coverage
- Missing temperature effects
- Oversimplified predation

2. Proposed Changes:
- Added temperature-dependent COTS reproduction using Gaussian response curve
- Implemented density-dependent predation rates
- Modified attack rates to depend on COTS density
- Adjusted coral carrying capacities to match observed ranges

3. Ecological Justification:
- COTS reproduction is known to be temperature-sensitive
- Higher COTS densities lead to more efficient coral predation
- Coral coverage limits aligned with field observations
