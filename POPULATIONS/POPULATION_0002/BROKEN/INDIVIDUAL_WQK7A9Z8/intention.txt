Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Model Evaluation:
- Base model captures general population dynamics but underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes
- Coral predation mechanics present but outbreak triggers need strengthening
- Temperature effects included but may not fully capture environmental influences

Key Improvement: Adding Allee Effect
Justification:
1. COTS show strong density-dependent reproduction success
2. Higher densities enable more successful fertilization
3. Group feeding behavior provides benefits at higher numbers
4. Predator saturation occurs above critical densities

This addition should better capture the characteristic rapid population explosions
while maintaining biological realism without excessive complexity.
