Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Model Assessment:
- Basic coral-COTS dynamics captured but outbreak magnitudes understated
- Temperature-dependent reproduction included but environmental responses simplified
- Missing key density-dependent reproductive mechanisms

Proposed Improvement:
Adding Allee effect to COTS population dynamics to better represent:
1. Density-dependent fertilization success during spawning
2. Reduced reproductive success at low population densities
3. More realistic threshold dynamics for outbreak initiation

This addition will help capture:
- More realistic outbreak triggers
- Sharper transitions between normal and outbreak states
- Population persistence patterns
