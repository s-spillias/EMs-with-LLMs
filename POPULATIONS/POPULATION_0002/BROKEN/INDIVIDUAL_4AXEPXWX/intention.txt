Model Assessment:
Current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and doesn't fully represent population explosion mechanisms.

Improvement: Adding Allee effect to COTS reproduction
Rationale:
- COTS are broadcast spawners where fertilization success increases with population density
- This creates positive feedback during population growth that drives outbreak dynamics
- Should better capture rapid population explosions while maintaining natural collapse mechanisms
