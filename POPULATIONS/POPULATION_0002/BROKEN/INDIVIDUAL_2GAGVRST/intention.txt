Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

1. Current Limitations:
- Underestimates magnitude of COTS outbreaks
- Doesn't capture enhanced predation during aggregations
- Misses extreme population crashes in fast-growing corals

2. Ecological Improvement:
Added Allee effect and density-dependent predation efficiency to better represent:
- Critical density threshold for outbreak initiation
- Enhanced feeding efficiency during aggregations
- More realistic boom-bust dynamics

3. Mathematical Implementation:
- Allee effect term: (cots_pred / A_thresh) for positive density dependence
- Modified predation terms with density-dependent efficiency
- New parameters: A_thresh (Allee threshold) and e_max (maximum feeding efficiency)
