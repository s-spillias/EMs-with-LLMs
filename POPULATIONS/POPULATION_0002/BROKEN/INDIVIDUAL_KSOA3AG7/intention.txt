Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and misses key behavioral transitions. The addition of an Allee effect will better represent the characteristic population explosions seen in COTS outbreaks.

Ecological Justification:
1. COTS show positive density dependence during population growth phases due to:
   - Enhanced fertilization success at higher densities
   - Group feeding benefits and coral defense overwhelm
   - Predator saturation effects
2. This mechanism helps explain the rapid transition from low numbers to outbreak levels
3. The Allee effect works alongside carrying capacity limits to create more realistic boom-bust cycles

Mathematical Implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter (A_cots)
- Modified growth term to include positive density dependence below threshold
- Maintained negative density dependence near carrying capacity
- Preserved temperature and resource availability effects
