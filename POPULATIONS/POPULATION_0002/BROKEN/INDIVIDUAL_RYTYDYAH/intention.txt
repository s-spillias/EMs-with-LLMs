Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

The current model captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and doesn't fully represent mechanisms that trigger rapid population increases. Key improvement needed: Add Allee effects to COTS population dynamics.

Ecological Justification:
- COTS reproduction requires successful external fertilization
- Fertilization rates increase with adult density (positive density dependence)
- This creates a threshold effect that can trigger sudden outbreaks
- High densities still lead to competition (negative density dependence)
- Combined effects help explain characteristic boom-bust cycles

Mathematical Implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter (A_cots)
- Modified COTS growth term to include density-dependent fertilization success
- Maintains existing carrying capacity effects
- Results in stronger positive feedback during population increases
