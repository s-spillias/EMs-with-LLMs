Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Limitations:
- Underpredicts magnitude of COTS outbreaks
- Misses characteristic boom-bust dynamics
- Oversimplified population growth mechanics

Improvement: Adding Allee Effect
- Implements positive density dependence at low COTS densities
- Represents enhanced fertilization success when populations reach critical density
- Maintains negative density dependence at high populations
- Better captures outbreak trigger mechanisms

Mathematical Implementation:
- Modified logistic growth with Allee threshold
- New parameter A_cots represents critical density for positive feedback
- Growth rate now depends on both low-density enhancement and high-density limitation
