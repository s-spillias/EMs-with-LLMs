Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Issues:
- Model fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics
- Coral predictions show unrealistic constant values
- Missing temperature and resource-dependent mechanisms

Proposed Improvements:
1. Add temperature-dependent COTS reproduction using a Gaussian response curve
2. Make COTS growth rate dependent on available coral resources
3. Implement more realistic predation dynamics

Ecological Justification:
- COTS reproduction is known to be temperature-sensitive
- Population growth should be limited by coral food availability
- These mechanisms are essential for generating realistic outbreak cycles
