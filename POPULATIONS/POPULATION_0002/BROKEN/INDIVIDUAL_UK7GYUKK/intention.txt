Model Assessment and Improvements:

1. Current Performance:
- Basic dynamics captured but outbreak magnitudes underestimated
- Temperature response may be too simplified
- Missing important density-dependent effects

2. Proposed Change: Addition of Allee Effect
- Implements strong Allee effect in COTS population dynamics
- Provides mechanism for sudden population explosions
- Better represents ecological reality of broadcast spawning
- Maintains negative density dependence at high populations

3. Ecological Justification:
- COTS are broadcast spawners requiring minimal population density for successful fertilization
- Creates more realistic threshold-like outbreak behavior
- Supported by literature on marine invertebrate reproduction
