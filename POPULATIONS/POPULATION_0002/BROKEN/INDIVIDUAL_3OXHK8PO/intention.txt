Model Assessment:
Current model underpredicts COTS outbreaks and fails to capture characteristic boom-bust dynamics. While it includes basic temperature effects and predator-prey interactions, it misses key mechanisms that drive outbreak behavior.

Improvement: Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics
Rationale: COTS require sufficient population density for successful fertilization during spawning. Below critical densities, reproduction is severely limited. This creates positive density dependence at low numbers, helping explain why populations can remain low for years before suddenly exploding into outbreaks when conditions align.

Mathematical implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter (A_cots)
- Modified COTS growth equation to include positive density dependence term (cots_pred/(cots_pred + A_cots))
- This creates stronger growth at higher densities while suppressing growth at very low densities
