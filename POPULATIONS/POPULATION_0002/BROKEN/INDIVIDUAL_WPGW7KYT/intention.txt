Model Assessment:
The current model underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes and fails to capture characteristic boom-bust cycles. While temperature effects are included, the model lacks critical density-dependent reproduction mechanisms.

Improvement:
Added Allee effect parameter (allee_threshold) to represent minimum COTS density needed for successful reproduction. This creates more realistic population dynamics by:
1. Suppressing growth at low densities
2. Enabling rapid population increase above critical thresholds
3. Better representing the bistable nature of COTS populations (low stable state vs outbreak state)
