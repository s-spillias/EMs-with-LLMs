Model Assessment:
- Current model fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics and shows unrealistic coral predictions
- Linear functional responses and simple logistic growth are insufficient

Proposed Improvement:
Adding Allee effects and temperature-dependent reproduction for COTS to better represent:
1. Population threshold effects that drive outbreak cycles
2. Temperature influence on reproduction success
3. More realistic boom-bust dynamics

This maintains model parsimony while incorporating key ecological mechanisms for outbreak dynamics.
