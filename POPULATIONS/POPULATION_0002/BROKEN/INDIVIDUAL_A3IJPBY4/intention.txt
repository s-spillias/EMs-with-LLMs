Model Assessment:
The current model fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics and their impact on coral populations. The predictions show excessive dampening of population fluctuations compared to historical data.

Improvement Implementation:
Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics to represent density-dependent reproduction success. This better captures the biological mechanism where COTS spawning success increases with local population density due to improved fertilization rates in dense populations.

The Allee effect is implemented using a sigmoid function that modifies the COTS growth rate based on population density. This creates a threshold-like response where population growth accelerates above certain densities, helping to trigger outbreak events.

Mathematical representation:
Allee_effect = density / (threshold + density)

This modification helps capture:
1. The sudden onset of outbreaks when populations reach critical densities
2. More realistic boom-bust cycles
3. Better timing and magnitude of population explosions
