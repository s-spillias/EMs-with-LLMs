Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

The current model underestimates COTS outbreak dynamics and coral response variability. Key limitations:
1. Linear density dependence in COTS growth doesn't capture population explosion triggers
2. Immediate coral recovery unrealistic after intense predation
3. Missing critical threshold effects in population dynamics

Improvement Implementation:
1. Added Allee effect parameter (A_cots) to create critical population threshold for outbreaks
2. Introduced coral recovery delay parameters (tau_fast, tau_slow) 
3. Modified COTS growth equation to include positive density dependence at low numbers
4. Added time-delayed coral recovery response

These changes better represent:
- Population outbreak triggers requiring minimal viable population
- Realistic delays in coral recovery after predation events
- More accurate boom-bust cycle dynamics
