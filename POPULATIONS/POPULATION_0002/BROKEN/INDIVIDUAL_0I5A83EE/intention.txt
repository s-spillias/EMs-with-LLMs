Model Assessment and Improvements:

1. Current Limitations:
- Underpredicts COTS outbreak magnitudes
- Oversmoothes population dynamics
- Misses timing of major outbreaks

2. Added Allee Effect:
- Implements density-dependent reproduction in COTS
- Creates threshold effect needed for outbreak dynamics
- Mathematically represented as: reproduction_rate * (P/A)^β * (1 - P/K)
  where P is population, A is Allee threshold, β is Allee exponent
- Better captures biological reality of broadcast spawning
