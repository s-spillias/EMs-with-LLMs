Model Assessment:
Current implementation underpredicts COTS outbreak magnitudes and misses explosive population dynamics. Coral predictions show overly dampened responses to COTS predation.

Improvement Strategy:
Added Allee effect parameter (A_cots) to capture critical population density threshold for COTS outbreaks. This creates positive density dependence at low populations and better represents:
1. Reproductive success increasing with adult density
2. Predator saturation effects
3. Synchronized spawning benefits

The Allee effect term modifies the COTS growth rate, creating a threshold-like response that better matches observed outbreak patterns.
