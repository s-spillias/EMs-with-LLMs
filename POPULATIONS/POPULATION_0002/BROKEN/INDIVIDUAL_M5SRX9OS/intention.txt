Model Assessment and Improvements:

1. Current Issues:
- Underpredicts COTS outbreak magnitudes
- Oversmoothes population dynamics
- Misses outbreak timing
- Lacks key density-dependent mechanisms

2. Proposed Change: Add Allee Effect
- Implements strong Allee effect in COTS population dynamics
- Adds critical population threshold below which growth is suppressed
- Creates bistability that better matches boom-bust dynamics
- More realistically represents reproductive success depending on population density

3. Ecological Justification:
- COTS require proximity for successful fertilization
- Low densities result in reproductive failure
- High densities trigger mass spawning events
- Creates positive feedback that drives outbreak dynamics
