Model Assessment and Improvements:

1. Current Issues:
- Underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes
- Fails to capture sharp transitions between stable and outbreak states
- Oversmoothes population dynamics

2. Proposed Solution:
Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics to better represent:
- Critical density threshold for successful reproduction
- Non-linear increase in reproductive success with population density
- More realistic outbreak triggers

This modification better aligns with known COTS ecology where population growth
accelerates above certain density thresholds due to increased fertilization
success and predator saturation.
