Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Limitations:
- Underpredicts magnitude of COTS outbreaks
- Misses characteristic boom-bust dynamics
- Uses simple logistic growth which doesn't capture population threshold effects

Improvement: Adding Allee Effect
- Incorporates minimum population threshold for successful reproduction
- Better represents real COTS population dynamics where reproduction success increases with density
- Helps explain sudden population explosions once critical density is exceeded
- Mathematical implementation uses modified logistic growth with Allee threshold
