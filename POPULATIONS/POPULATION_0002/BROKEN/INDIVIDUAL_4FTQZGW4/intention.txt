Model Assessment:
Current implementation shows reasonable tracking of general population trends but fails to capture the explosive nature of COTS outbreaks and underestimates peak populations.

Improvement Strategy:
Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics to better represent:
1. Difficulty in population growth at low densities due to mate-finding limitations
2. Rapid population growth above critical threshold densities
3. More realistic boom-bust cycle dynamics

This modification better aligns with known COTS outbreak characteristics while maintaining model parsimony.
