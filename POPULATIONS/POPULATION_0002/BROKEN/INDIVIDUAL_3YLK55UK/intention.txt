Model Assessment and Improvements:

1. Current model limitations:
- Underpredicts COTS outbreak magnitudes
- Misses explosive nature of population growth
- Oversimplified population growth dynamics

2. Added Allee effect mechanism:
- Introduces critical population threshold for outbreak initiation
- Better represents collective reproductive success at higher densities
- Maintains suppression at low densities matching ecological observations
- More realistically captures boom-bust dynamics characteristic of COTS

3. Implementation:
- Modified COTS growth equation to include Allee term
- Added Allee threshold parameter (A_cots)
- Maintains temperature and resource dependencies
