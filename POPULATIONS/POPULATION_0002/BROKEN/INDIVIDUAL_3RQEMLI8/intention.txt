Model Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

The current model underestimates both the magnitude of COTS outbreaks and their impact on coral populations, particularly fast-growing corals. While it includes basic temperature effects and resource dependency, it misses key nonlinear population processes that drive outbreak dynamics.

Proposed Improvements:

1. Added Allee effect parameter (allee_threshold) to capture enhanced reproductive success during outbreaks when COTS populations exceed critical densities. This reflects:
   - Increased fertilization success at higher densities
   - Group feeding advantages
   - Reduced per-capita predation risk

2. Added density-dependent predation rates through predation_scaling parameter to represent:
   - More efficient coral consumption during outbreaks
   - Group feeding behavior
   - Reduced search times at higher COTS densities

These additions better capture the explosive nature of outbreaks while maintaining mechanistic interpretability. The modifications should improve prediction of both outbreak magnitude and coral impact patterns.
