Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Issues:
- Model fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics
- Predictions show unrealistic stability
- Temperature effects not implemented
- Missing key population mechanisms

Proposed Improvement:
Adding Allee effect and temperature-dependent reproduction for COTS population dynamics to better capture outbreak behavior. This combines:
1. Positive density dependence at low populations (Allee effect)
2. Temperature-dependent reproductive success
3. Modified carrying capacity effects

These mechanisms are essential for modeling the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks, as they create the potential for sudden population explosions when conditions are favorable.
