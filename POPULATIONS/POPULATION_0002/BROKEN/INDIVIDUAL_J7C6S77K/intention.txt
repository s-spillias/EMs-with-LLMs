Model Assessment:
- Current model fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics and overestimates coral coverage
- Simple logistic growth inadequate for complex population interactions
- Missing key ecological mechanisms for outbreak triggers

Improvement Strategy:
Added Allee effects and density-dependent predation to better represent:
1. COTS population dynamics with reproductive threshold effects
2. Increased predation pressure during outbreaks
3. More realistic coral mortality during high COTS density periods

This improves biological realism by incorporating:
- Minimum population threshold for successful reproduction
- Enhanced predation impact during outbreaks
- More accurate representation of coral mortality patterns
