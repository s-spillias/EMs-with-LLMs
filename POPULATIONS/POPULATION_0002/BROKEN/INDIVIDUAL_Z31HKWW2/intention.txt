Model Assessment and Improvements:

1. Current model limitations:
- Fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics
- Predicts unrealistic constant coral coverage
- Missing temperature effects on population dynamics
- Oversimplified predator-prey interactions

2. Implemented improvements:
- Added temperature-dependent COTS reproduction using Gaussian response curve
- Modified predation terms to use Holling Type III functional response
- This captures:
  * Temperature influence on COTS population growth
  * More realistic predator-prey dynamics with prey switching behavior
  * Better representation of outbreak triggers and coral recovery
