Model Assessment:
The current model underestimates COTS outbreak magnitudes and fails to capture the characteristic sharp population increases. The simple logistic growth model produces too gradual of changes compared to historical data.

Improvement Strategy:
Adding an Allee effect to the COTS population dynamics to better represent:
1. Difficulty in population growth at very low densities (due to mate-finding limitations)
2. Rapid population growth once critical density is reached
3. Ultimate limitation by carrying capacity

This creates a more realistic representation of outbreak triggers and better matches the observed boom-bust dynamics.
