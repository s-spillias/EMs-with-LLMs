Model Assessment and Improvements:

The current model underestimates both the magnitude of COTS outbreaks and the severity of their impacts on coral populations. While it captures general trends, it fails to reproduce the explosive nature of outbreaks seen in historical data.

Key Improvement: Added Allee Effect
- Implemented a strong Allee effect in COTS population dynamics
- Added Allee threshold parameter (A_cots) representing minimum viable population
- Modified growth equation to include density-dependent reproduction success
- This better represents:
  1. Difficulty in population establishment at low densities
  2. Rapid population growth once critical density is reached
  3. Natural limitation at high densities

Ecological Justification:
COTS show clear Allee effects in nature due to:
- Broadcast spawning requiring minimum density for successful fertilization
- Group feeding behaviors that enhance predation efficiency
- Increased predation pressure at low densities
