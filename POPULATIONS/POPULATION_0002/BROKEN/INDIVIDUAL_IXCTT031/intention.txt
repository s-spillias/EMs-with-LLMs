Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Model Limitations:
- Underpredicts magnitude of COTS outbreaks
- Misses key population boom acceleration
- Oversimplified reproduction dynamics

Improvement: Adding Allee Effects
- Implements density-dependent reproduction efficiency
- COTS reproduction rate increases at moderate densities (mate-finding success)
- Decreases at high densities (resource competition)
- Better captures characteristic outbreak dynamics
- Maintains model parsimony while adding ecological realism
