Model Assessment:
- Current model underpredicts COTS outbreak magnitudes and misses timing
- Coral predictions lack realistic recovery patterns
- Temperature effects are oversimplified

Improvement: Added Allee effect to COTS population dynamics
Rationale: COTS show strong positive density dependence during outbreak initiation due to:
- Enhanced fertilization success at higher densities
- Predator saturation effects
- Group feeding benefits

This modification should better capture the characteristic rapid outbreak development
while maintaining biological realism.
