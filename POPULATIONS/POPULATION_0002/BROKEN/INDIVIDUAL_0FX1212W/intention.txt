Model Assessment:
The current model fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics and their impacts on coral populations. The predictions show unrealistic stability compared to historical data.

Proposed Improvement:
Adding Allee effects and temperature-dependent reproduction to better model COTS population dynamics:
1. Allee effect term to capture reduced reproduction at low densities
2. Temperature-dependent reproduction rate using Gaussian response curve
3. Modified growth equation combining both effects

This will help capture:
- Difficulty in establishing outbreaks at low densities
- Temperature-driven population explosions
- More realistic boom-bust cycles
