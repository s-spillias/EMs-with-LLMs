Model Assessment and Improvements:

1. Current model limitations:
- Underestimates magnitude of COTS outbreak peaks
- Oversmoothes coral cover dynamics
- Lacks mechanisms for explosive population growth

2. Added Allee effect mechanism:
- Introduces critical population threshold for COTS reproduction
- Better captures biological reality of broadcast spawning
- Creates more realistic boom-bust dynamics through density-dependent reproduction success
- Helps explain why populations can persist at low levels before rapid outbreaks
