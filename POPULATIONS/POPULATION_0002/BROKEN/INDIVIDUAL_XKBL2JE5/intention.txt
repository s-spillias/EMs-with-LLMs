Model Assessment:
Current implementation captures basic COTS-coral dynamics but underestimates outbreak magnitudes and recovery patterns. Temperature effects and predation preferences are included but may oversimplify key mechanisms.

Improvement: Added Allee effect in COTS reproduction
Rationale: COTS show positive density dependence during spawning events due to fertilization success increasing with adult density. This mechanism helps explain rapid outbreak development while maintaining population regulation at high densities through resource limitation.

Mathematical implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter (A_cots)
- Modified growth term to include density-dependent fertilization success
- Maintains original carrying capacity regulation
