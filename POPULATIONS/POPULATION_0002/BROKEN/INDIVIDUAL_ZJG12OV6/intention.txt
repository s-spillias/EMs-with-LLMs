Model Assessment:
The current model fails to capture COTS outbreak dynamics and shows unrealistic constant predictions for coral coverage. Key limitations include oversimplified COTS population growth and predation mechanisms.

Proposed Improvements:
1. Add temperature-dependent COTS reproduction using a Gaussian response curve around T_opt
2. Implement density-dependent predation rates that increase with COTS density
3. Modified attack rates to better represent predator functional response

Ecological Justification:
- COTS reproduction is known to be temperature-sensitive, affecting outbreak timing
- Higher COTS densities lead to more efficient coral predation through aggregation
- These mechanisms are essential for capturing boom-bust dynamics
