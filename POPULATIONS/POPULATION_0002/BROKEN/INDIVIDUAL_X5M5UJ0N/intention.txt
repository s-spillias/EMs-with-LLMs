Model Assessment and Improvement Plan

Current Model Limitations:
1. Underestimates magnitude of COTS outbreaks
2. Misses sharp population transitions
3. Oversimplifies outbreak triggering mechanisms

Improvement: Adding Allee Effect
- Implements positive density dependence in COTS reproduction
- Critical population threshold needed for successful spawning
- Better captures explosive nature of outbreaks
- Ecological basis: COTS require proximity for successful fertilization

Mathematical Implementation:
- Added Allee threshold parameter (A_cots)
- Modified COTS growth term with Allee function
- Maintains other key dynamics while improving outbreak triggers
