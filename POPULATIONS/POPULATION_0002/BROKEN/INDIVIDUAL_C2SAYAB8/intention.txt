Model Assessment:
The current model oversimplifies COTS population dynamics by using basic logistic growth, resulting in unrealistic stable predictions that miss observed outbreak patterns.

Proposed Improvement:
Adding temperature-dependent reproduction and an Allee effect to better capture COTS outbreak dynamics:
1. Temperature effect: Reproduction peaks at optimal temperature (T_opt) and declines at higher/lower temperatures
2. Allee effect: Population growth is reduced at low densities due to mate-finding limitations
3. Combined effect creates conditions where outbreaks can be triggered when both temperature and density are favorable

These mechanisms are ecologically justified as:
- COTS reproduction is known to be temperature-sensitive
- Fertilization success depends on adult density due to broadcast spawning
- The combination can create positive feedback leading to rapid population growth under favorable conditions
