ASSESSMENT

Fit to data
- Residuals file was not provided in the current context, so I cannot compute or visualize fit diagnostics directly. Please share the residuals to confirm these patterns.
- Based on structure alone, the model is likely to capture broad boom-bust patterns thanks to:
  - Stage structure with a juvenile pool and minimum one-year lag (stored recruitment),
  - Food-limited maturation and adult survival,
  - Predation on two coral groups with saturating functional response,
  - Thermal modifiers on larval survival and coral growth.
- Potential misfits commonly seen in similar systems (to check in residuals):
  1) Outbreak peak timing slightly early/late, due to abrupt (instantaneous) bleaching mortality tied only to current SST.
  2) Underestimation of coral losses following extreme heat events, because true bleaching depends on cumulative heat stress, not instantaneous temperature alone.
  3) Over-smoothing of outbreak magnitudes when larval survival pulses are driven by nutrient/river-discharge events not represented by available forcings.

Alignment with project context
- The model already emphasizes outbreak dynamics with juvenile storage and Allee effects, consistent with observed boom-bust cycles on the GBR.
- Selective predation on fast vs slow corals is represented via preference and separate saturation terms.
- Environmental controls on larvae (temperature) and corals (temperature, bleaching) are included, but bleaching lacked memory, which is key to reproducing the magnitude and duration of coral loss that drives the bust phase.

Missing or oversimplified processes
- Bleaching mortality was instantaneous with respect to SST. Ecologically, bleaching risk is governed by cumulative thermal stress (e.g., degree heating weeks), with persistence across seasons.
- Larval survival is strongly influenced by nutrient/phytoplankton pulses (river discharge, water quality). Without an external nutrient proxy, the model may attribute outbreak peaks to other drivers, potentially biasing parameters.
- Disturbances such as cyclones or crown-of-thorns control efforts are not explicitly modeled.
- Predator control or disease on COTS are not represented.

PARAMETER REVIEW
- Many parameters are literature-based and bounded via soft penalties. No items flagged as newly updated from literature in the provided file; placeholders (initial estimates) remain for: K_pred_*, K_food, k_imm, mJ, mu_JA_max, K_tot, min_sd, q_pred, etc.
- The previous bleaching parameters:
  - T_bleach (29.5°C) is a reasonable threshold for initiation of stress.
  - log_tau_bleach defines a scale; under the old instantaneous formulation it was a temperature “width.” Under the revised cumulative-stress mapping, it becomes the scale linking accumulated stress to mortality.
- Given the project emphasis on timing/magnitude of outbreaks, representing cumulative bleaching is more impactful than introducing additional larval drivers without data support.

CHOSEN IMPROVEMENT: Cumulative thermal-stress bleaching (memory)
Ecological rationale:
- Coral bleaching and mortality correlate with cumulative exposure above a thermal threshold, with persistence across months. This shapes the magnitude/duration of coral loss post-heatwaves.
- Stronger/persistent coral loss leads to food scarcity for COTS, increasing adult mortality and reducing maturation, sharpening and appropriately timing the bust phase after peaks.

Mathematical formulation (annual time step):
- Cumulative thermal stress (state):
  HS_t = p_mem * HS_{t-1} + max(0, SST_t - T_bleach)
  where 0 < p_mem < 1 controls memory (persistence) of stress.
- Bleaching mortality gate:
  bleach_gate_t = invlogit(HS_t / tau_bleach)
  M_bleach_t = m_bleach * bleach_gate_t
- These replace the instantaneous invlogit((SST_t - T_bleach)/tau_bleach).

Implementation notes:
- Uses only exogenous forcing (SST), avoiding any data leakage from response variables.
- Adds one parameter (logit_p_bleach_mem) to control memory. T_bleach remains the threshold for accumulation; tau_bleach scales the conversion of cumulative stress to mortality.
- Diagnostic output includes heat_stress(t) to facilitate checking correspondence with known heatwave periods.

EXPECTED EFFECT ON FIT/RESIDUALS
- Coral residuals during/after heatwave years should improve (less underprediction of cover loss, better duration of depressed cover).
- COTS residuals around bust transitions should improve due to more realistic food scarcity and elevated adult mortality following coral loss.
- If residuals still show systematic misspecification at outbreak peaks, consider adding an external nutrient proxy for larval survival (e.g., river discharge or chlorophyll-a) in a subsequent iteration.

PARAMETER ADDITIONS/CHANGES
- Added: logit_p_bleach_mem (new). Suggested bounds on logit scale: [-5, 5], which maps to p_mem roughly [0.007, 0.993]. Soft penalty encourages p_mem ~ 0.2–0.98 as plausible for annual memory.
- Clarified descriptions of T_bleach and log_tau_bleach to align with cumulative-stress interpretation.

REQUEST
- Please provide the residuals file and any available nutrient/river discharge or chlorophyll-a time series. That would enable testing a larval survival modifier and further refine outbreak timing/magnitude if needed.
