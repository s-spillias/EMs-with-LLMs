Assessment summary and proposed ecological improvement

Data fit (based on available information):
- I do not have the residuals file or any numeric diagnostics, so I cannot quantify fit quality. Structurally, the model is coherent and avoids data leakage by using previous time step states for process updates.
- Likelihood choices are reasonable: lognormal for COTS densities and Gaussian for coral percent cover, with soft penalties to discourage biologically implausible coral bounds instead of hard truncation.

Addressing the PROJECT CONTEXT (episodic COTS outbreaks):
- Strengths already present:
  - Nonlinear density feedbacks for COTS (Ricker-like core with Allee effect) can generate boom-bust cycles.
  - Type-III functional response captures saturation and refuge at low COTS density; selective predation differentiates fast vs slow corals.
  - Resource limitation via food availability saturating function modulates both per-capita growth and carrying capacity.
  - Temperature affects COTS through a Gaussian thermal performance curve (TPC) modulating adult per-capita growth.
  - One-year juvenile lag introduces a realistic recruitment delay.

- Gaps for episodicity:
  - Empirical work suggests outbreak initiation is strongly tied to environmental conditions that enhance early life stage survival (e.g., temperature-influenced fertilization and larval survival, and nutrient pulses). Currently, environmental modulation is applied to adult per-capita growth but not to the larval/settlement pathway. Without an environmental trigger on settlement, the timing and magnitude of recruitment pulses may be muted, making it harder to reproduce sharp outbreak onsets.

Potentially missing or oversimplified processes:
- Early-life environmental control (larval survival/fertilization success): not explicitly modeled. This is a key driver of episodic recruitment pulses.
- Multi-year larval “bank” or longer maturation delays: a single one-year lag may understate persistence of outbreak cohorts.
- Predator control on COTS: not present; could be relevant but requires additional data.
- Disturbance pulses (e.g., cyclones, flood plumes): not included; these can shape coral cover and larval food but require covariates.

Parameter review highlights:
- m_C is effectively fixed at 2.56 year^-1 (lower_bound ≈ upper_bound). This can enforce strong bust phases; it may be correct from literature but reduces flexibility. If residuals show persistent bias in COTS decline rates, consider relaxing bounds slightly.
- Topt_C is tightly bounded [28.0, 29.0], which is reasonable for adult processes. However, larvae often have a different (and sometimes narrower) optimal thermal window than adults.
- Several parameters are marked as initial estimates (k_bleach, H_half, K_C, starvation_scale, K_food). These should be checked against residual diagnostics for identifiability and sensitivity.

Chosen ecological improvement: Environmental modifier on larval/settlement pathway (Temperature-dependent larval performance)
Rationale:
- Outbreaks are frequently triggered by pulses in early life-stage survival. Adding a temperature-dependent larval performance multiplier to settlement and early survival will enhance the model’s ability to generate episodic recruitment pulses aligned with favorable thermal conditions.
- This targets the key outbreak trigger mechanism with minimal added complexity and avoids data leakage (uses previous-year SST).
- It is complementary to the existing adult TPC (r_C), acknowledging that larvae and adults can have different thermal optima and breadths.

Mathematical implementation:
- Add two new parameters:
  - Topt_L (°C): Optimal temperature for larval performance (fertilization, larval survival).
  - sigma_T_L (°C): Breadth (standard deviation) of larval thermal performance.
- Define larval thermal performance at time t using previous-year SST:
  larv_tpc_t = exp(-0.5 * ((SST_{t-1} - Topt_L) / sigma_T_L)^2)
- Apply this multiplicatively to the new juvenile cohort formed at time t:
  J_new,t = larv_tpc_t * (gamma_A * pred_A,t + gamma_S * pred_S,t + imm_surv * cotsimm_dat(t-1))
- All other dynamics remain unchanged. This single-stage modifier focuses the environmental effect where it most directly drives outbreak pulses.

Expected effect:
- Years with temperatures near Topt_L will produce amplified settlement pulses, sharpening outbreak onsets and influencing magnitude/duration through the existing feedbacks (resource limitation, predation saturation, Allee effect, and adult mortality).
- Years far from Topt_L will dampen settlement, suppressing outbreak initiation.

Notes and cautions:
- With m_C tightly fixed high, recruitment pulses may need to be stronger to overcome adult mortality; if residuals show underestimation of outbreak peaks, consider revisiting the rigidity of m_C bounds.
- If residuals indicate mismatches in timing, the larval TPC parameters (Topt_L, sigma_T_L) offer interpretable tuning knobs.

No data leakage is introduced: larv_tpc uses SST from t-1.
