Assessment of current model and rationale for improvement

Fit and residuals:
- The residuals file was not provided in this context, so I could not directly quantify fit quality or inspect temporal patterns of misfit (e.g., around outbreak onsets and peaks). Please share the residuals to confirm these diagnostics.
- Based on typical COTS model behavior, a common issue is under-prediction of the speed and magnitude of outbreak onset and occasional mistiming of peak abundance. This often arises when recruitment/settlement responds too smoothly to food availability (Michaelis–Menten form), blunting threshold dynamics necessary for boom-bust cycles.

Alignment with project context:
- The current model contains many key mechanisms relevant to episodic outbreaks:
  - Predation on both fast (Acropora) and slow corals with saturating functional responses and shape exponent (q_pred).
  - Temperature modifiers for coral growth and larval survival, and bleaching mortality.
  - Adult reproduction with density dependence (Ricker), an adult Allee-like gate, and immigration forcing.
  - Food limitation via a saturating term using preferred coral composition.
  - Food-dependent adult survival.
- These are consistent with the need to capture selective coral predation and boom-bust cycles. However, the food limitation is strictly q = 1 (Michaelis–Menten), which can be too gradual to generate sharp, episodic recruitment pulses.

Potentially missing or oversimplified processes:
- Nonlinear recruitment response to habitat/food availability: Empirical evidence suggests that larval settlement and early survival respond in a more threshold-like fashion to Acropora cover and structural microhabitats. A Hill-type saturation with exponent q_food > 1 provides a parsimonious and ecologically grounded way to represent this.
- Multi-year maturation delays and nutrient-driven larval survival pulses may further improve realism, but they add state complexity or require additional covariates not currently available in the data interface provided here.

Chosen single improvement:
- Introduce a Hill exponent (q_food) in the food limitation used in both reproduction and adult food-dependent mortality. This is a higher-order, non-linear response and a resource limitation mechanism that:
  - Creates switch-like recruitment amplification once coral cover crosses a threshold, aiding the timing and magnitude of outbreak initiation.
  - Retains negative feedback: as COTS deplete coral, Food rapidly declines, suppressing recruitment and increasing adult mortality, promoting bust dynamics.
  - Adds only one parameter, minimizing complexity inflation and avoiding new data dependencies.

Details of change:
- Replace Food = Food_num / (K_food + Food_num) with Food = (Food_num^q_food) / (K_food^q_food + Food_num^q_food), where Food_num = pref_fast * F_t + (1 - pref_fast) * S_t (both in % cover).
- Use this Food consistently in:
  - L_t = phi * C_t * Food * EnvLarv * exp(-beta*C_t) * A_gate + k_imm * Imm_t
  - mA_eff = mA + mA_food * (1 - Food)
- New parameter:
  - log_q_food (import_type: PARAMETER), with q_food = exp(log_q_food). Bounds suggest q_food in [1, 5] (log bounds [0, ln 5]), reflecting a range from Michaelis–Menten to strongly threshold-like responses. This is biologically plausible given settlement and foraging saturation behaviors.

Notes on parameter review:
- Most parameters remain consistent with literature-based priors given in the file. Topt_larv bounds were updated from literature; this does not itself require a structural change, but the added q_food parameter complements these environmental effects by controlling habitat/food nonlinearity.
- q_pred is centered at ln(2) (Type III), which is reasonable and retained.

Next steps:
- Please provide the residuals file so we can verify whether misfits cluster during outbreak onsets/peaks and assess whether the new q_food improves timing and magnitude. If misfit persists, consider (a) a 2-step maturation delay compartment or (b) an external pulsed covariate for larval survival (e.g., nutrient/flood indices) as follow-on improvements.
