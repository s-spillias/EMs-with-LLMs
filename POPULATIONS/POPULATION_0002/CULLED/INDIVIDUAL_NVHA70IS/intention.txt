PROJECT CONTEXT
Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, aiming to capture timing, magnitude, and duration of boom-bust cycles while accounting for selective predation on corals.

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT MODEL
1) Fit to data
- A residuals file was requested for review but was not provided in this chat. Without it, I cannot quantify fit quality or diagnose time/scale-specific biases. Please share residuals to refine diagnostics.
- Based on the current structure, typical challenges for COTS outbreak systems include:
  - Underprediction of outbreak peaks (insufficient nonlinear amplification of recruitment/growth).
  - Overprediction of low-density persistence (outbreak crashes not steep enough).
  - Phase/timing errors when outbreak triggering is too gradual relative to ecological thresholds.

2) Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths:
  - Includes Type-III functional response for coral predation, Allee effect for COTS, thermal performance for reproduction (TPC), resource dependence via coral cover, and immigration.
  - Soft constraints avoid hard truncation and support smooth optimization.
  - Observation models are reasonable (lognormal for COTS, Gaussian for corals).
- Gaps relative to episodic outbreaks:
  - Resource limitation is modeled with a simple Michaelis-Menten type saturating function. This often smooths responses and can fail to create the sharp transitions typical of outbreaks.
  - No explicit pulse drivers (e.g., nutrient/runoff-induced larval survival surges). Absent exogenous pulses, stronger endogenous nonlinearity in resource-recruitment efficiency is often needed to reproduce boom-bust dynamics.
  - COTS adult mortality (m_C) is high and tightly constrained (fixed to ≈2.56), implying outbreak peaks require strong, threshold-like recruitment/growth episodes to overcome mortality.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Threshold/nonlinear recruitment efficiency with respect to resource availability (dominant food: fast-growing Acropora) is oversimplified as a first-order saturation. Empirically, larval survival and successful recruitment can respond superlinearly to food (and environmental conditions), producing episodic recruitment.
- External nutrient/runoff pulses are not represented (data not available in this context).
- Predation on COTS by natural enemies is not modeled (data typically sparse).

PARAMETER REVIEW
- m_C is updated from literature and tightly bounded around 2.56 year^-1. This is biologically plausible but requires sufficiently strong nonlinear positive feedbacks to generate outbreaks.
- Other parameters remain flexible; gamma_A, gamma_S, and r_C provide levers for recruitment and growth but, without a sharper resource-response, may not create the rapid onset/outbreak thresholds.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT
Introduce a Hill-type nonlinearity in resource-driven processes to provide a sharper, threshold-like response to coral-derived resource availability.

Rationale:
- COTS outbreaks often require nonlinearly high larval survival/recruitment when food availability crosses a threshold. A Hill function with exponent ν>1 steepens the transition from low to high efficiency, enabling rapid outbreak onset when coral cover (especially Acropora) is sufficiently high.
- This directly addresses the episodic nature of outbreaks without requiring additional environmental covariates (e.g., nutrients), which are not available here.
- Complexity added is minimal (one additional parameter) and ecologically interpretable.

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
- Replace the simple saturating resource function with a Hill saturation:
  Food_t = x^ν / (K^ν + x^ν), x = φ_A A_prop + φ_S S_prop
  where ν = food_hill_nu ≥ 1.
- Apply this Hill function to:
  - food_avail, which modulates COTS per-capita growth and starvation mortality
  - K_eff, the effective carrying capacity
- Add new parameter: food_hill_nu (dimensionless Hill exponent; bounds [1, 5]; initial 3.0).

EXPECTED EFFECTS
- When coral-derived resources are scarce, recruitment/growth remains low (strong suppression).
- As coral cover crosses the Hill threshold, efficiency increases rapidly, enabling surge growth and outbreak peaks despite high adult mortality.
- As coral cover declines post-outbreak (due to predation/bleaching), food availability drops below the threshold, hastening crash—supporting realistic boom-bust cycles.

DATA CAUTION
- No current time-step observations are used in prediction updates; all drivers are taken from the previous time step to avoid data leakage (unchanged).
