Assessment, ecological review, and numerical stability fix

Numerical issue observed
- The wrapper reported objective_value = NaN during post-fit evaluation because predicted series (cots_pred, fast_pred, slow_pred) were not present in the model report object. Although the model used ADREPORT, the wrapper appears to read only REPORT outputs. This resulted in missing predictions, yielding NA MSEs and a NaN objective.
- Fix: Added REPORT(cots_pred), REPORT(fast_pred), REPORT(slow_pred) to ensure predictions are available for downstream evaluation. Kept ADREPORT as well for uncertainty workflows. No ecological dynamics were altered.

Ecological relationships review
1) Process rates biological reasonableness
- Coral regrowth: r_A ≈ 0.5 yr^-1 and r_S ≈ 0.2 yr^-1 are consistent with fast vs. slow coral recovery rates.
- Coral mortality: m_A, m_S are low background rates; bleaching mortality scales with soft thermal stress via b_A, b_S and soft threshold (T_bleach, k_bleach).
- COTS mortality: m_C near literature (~2.56 yr^-1) with potential starvation add-on via starvation_scale*(1 - food_avail), which rises when coral cover is depleted.
- COTS reproduction: r_C modulated by Gaussian thermal performance (Topt_C, sigma_T_C) and a smooth Allee effect (Alee_C), which are plausible for broadcast-spawning echinoderms.

2) Interaction strengths scaling
- Predation/consumption: Total per-area consumption cons_rate = f_max * H(C) * C with H a Type-III response (0..1). Units are coherent: f_max (proportion per indiv per yr) × C (indiv per m²) → proportion per yr. Prey allocation uses preference weights (c_attack_*) with prey-switching exponent eta_switch; removal from each coral saturates to available cover via 1 - exp(-x/availability). This constrains total feeding and avoids overconsumption.
- Food-mediated recruitment: gamma_A and gamma_S convert realized consumption (proportion area per year) into recruits (indiv m^-2 yr^-1), preserving stronger contribution from Acropora (gamma_A > gamma_S).
- Carrying capacity: K_eff = K_C * saturating01(phi_A*A + phi_S*S, K_food), linking density dependence to food. This appropriately reduces growth potential as coral declines.

3) Mechanism necessity
- Retained mechanisms are targeted: logistic coral regrowth with shared space limit (K_tot), thermal bleaching, density- and temperature-modulated COTS growth with Allee effect, starvation mortality, and multi-prey saturating consumption with prey switching. Each contributes to boom-bust dynamics and selective predation patterns required by the project context. No additional mechanisms are necessary at this time for numerical stability or identifiability.

4) Resource limitation effects
- Resource limitation acts through: (a) coral logistic regrowth bounded by K_tot (space), and (b) COTS capacity and starvation via food_avail, which saturates with weighted coral cover using K_food. This prevents runaway growth when prey are scarce and increases mortality post-outbreak, supporting realistic busts.

Notes on data usage
- The state transitions at time t use only predicted states and exogenous drivers from t-1 (no use of current-step observed variables), avoiding data leakage.

Summary of changes in this commit
- Added REPORT statements for predicted series to resolve NaN objective values caused by missing report outputs. No changes to ecological equations or parameters were made in this step since dynamics and scaling are appropriate for the project goals and numerical stability is adequate with the existing safeguards (eps floors, saturating functions).
