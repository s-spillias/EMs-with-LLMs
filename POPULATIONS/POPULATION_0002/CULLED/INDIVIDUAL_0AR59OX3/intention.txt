Assessment of current model and rationale for improvement

1) Fit to data (residuals)
- The instruction references a residuals file, but it was not provided here. Therefore, this assessment is based on process structure and parameterization only. If residuals indicate mis-timed outbreak peaks, overly sharp spikes, or too-rapid post-peak crashes, such patterns are consistent with immediate conversion of reproduction/immigration directly into adults without a maturation delay.

2) Alignment with project context
- Strengths:
  - Boom-bust potential via a Ricker-like adult update with Allee effects and starvation mortality.
  - Selective predation on coral groups with a Type-III functional response (captures predator saturation).
  - Resource limitation through a Hill-type food availability function (enables outbreak thresholds).
  - Thermal performance (Gaussian) modulating reproduction, acknowledging environmental drivers.

- Gaps relative to episodic outbreaks on the GBR:
  - No explicit maturation delay from juvenile to adult stages. Empirically, COTS typically reach reproductive maturity over ~2–3 years. Lack of delay can cause recruitment to inflate adults in the same year, often misaligning the timing and duration of observed outbreaks.
  - Immigration currently adds directly to adults; in reality, settlers contribute to a subadult cohort before appearing in adult surveys.
  - This missing delay can produce too-peaky dynamics and timing offsets compared to observed boom-bust cycles.

3) Potentially oversimplified processes
- Recruitment pathway: All locally produced recruits (via coral consumption) and immigrants are added to the adult class immediately. This likely compresses outbreak rise time and shortens persistence.
- Adult mortality m_C is tightly constrained by literature (2.56 year^-1), leaving less flexibility to match outbreak duration. With a fixed high mortality, the lack of a juvenile pipeline may make it hard to sustain observed multi-year plateaus.

Chosen ecological improvement: Introduce a 1-year maturation delay via a juvenile pool
- Approach: Environmental modifiers and indirect feedback (pipeline delay).
- Justification:
  - Adds minimal complexity (one latent state and one parameter) while targeting timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
  - Reflects known life history: settlers/juveniles take time to contribute to the adult population counted in monitoring.
  - Provides a “memory” that sustains adult densities across years following a strong recruitment pulse, better capturing the multi-year outbreak phase without violating the no data leakage constraint.

Mathematical changes
- New state: juvenile pool J_t (indiv m^-2). Recruits produced from local food-driven predation and larval immigration enter J_t in year t and mature to adults in year t+1.
- New parameter: juv_surv (dimensionless), the fraction of juveniles maturing/surviving to adults each year.
- Immigration interpretation: imm_surv now maps larval immigration to the juvenile pool (not directly to adults).

Updated equations (annual time step; all drivers evaluated at t-1):
- Juvenile inflow:
  J_new,t = softplus( gamma_A * pred_A,t + gamma_S * pred_S,t + imm_surv * IMM_{t-1} )
- Adults with 1-year maturation delay:
  C_t = softplus( C_{t-1} * exp( rC_allee,t * TPC_t * Food_t * (1 - C_{t-1}/K_eff,t)
                                 - m_C*(1 + starvation_scale*(1 - Food_t)) )
                  + juv_surv * J_{t-1} )
  J_t = J_new,t
- All other components (coral dynamics, H, Food, TPC) unchanged and continue to use t-1 states only.

Expected effects on dynamics
- Timing: Outbreak peaks are delayed by at least one year relative to recruitment drivers, improving alignment with observations.
- Magnitude: The juvenile pipeline buffers adult numbers, sustaining higher densities for longer when recruitment pulses are large.
- Duration: Multi-year outbreak plateaus become more plausible even with relatively high adult mortality m_C.

Parameter updates and bounds
- Added juv_surv (value=0.3, bounds [0,1]): Ecologically plausible as an annual maturation/survival fraction; to be estimated.
- Reinterpreted imm_surv description to reflect survival into the juvenile pool. Numerical bounds unchanged ([0,1]); existing value (0.5) remains plausible.

Notes and next steps
- Once residuals are available, check for:
  - Reduction in phase/timing error of peaks.
  - Improved persistence in adult densities post-peak.
  - Any over-smoothing of outbreak onset; if present, consider allowing juv_surv to vary with temperature/food or including a 2-year split cohort (J1->J2->adult) as a follow-on step.
- No data leakage is introduced: all state updates use only t-1 information; the juvenile pool is entirely predicted.
