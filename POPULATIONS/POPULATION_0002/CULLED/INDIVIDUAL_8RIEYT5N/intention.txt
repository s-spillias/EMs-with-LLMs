Assessment of current model:
- Fit and residuals: A residuals file was referenced but not provided here. Based on structure alone, the model likely gets overall trends but may mis-time or under-represent the magnitude of outbreak peaks because recruitment is added immediately to adults, which can smear peaks and reduce oscillation amplitude. If residuals show phase shifts (predicted peaks occurring earlier/later) or damped peaks, this is consistent with missing maturation delays.
- Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT: The model includes key mechanisms:
  - Selective predation on corals via Type-III response (predation intensity rises with COTS density).
  - Food availability feedbacks (phi_A, phi_S, K_food) and starvation mortality.
  - Thermal performance for COTS reproduction (TPC) and smooth bleaching effects on corals.
  - Allee effect at low COTS density.
  These address several elements of boom-bust dynamics, but timing of outbreaks is strongly influenced by larval development times (roughly ~1 year to detectable juveniles/subadults). That delay is not represented, which can limit the model’s ability to generate sharp, episodic booms with realistic timing.
- Potentially missing or oversimplified processes:
  1) Maturation delay (larval/juvenile to adult) — missing.
  2) Environmental pulses that boost larval survival (e.g., runoff-driven food pulses) — partly represented by cotsimm_dat and TPC, but recruitment is still immediate.
  3) Nonlinearity in recruitment versus consumption — partially included via Type-III predation and food saturation, but recruitment term is additive and instantaneous.
- Parameter review highlights:
  - m_C is updated from literature to 2.56 (narrow bounds in parameters.json). A high adult mortality rate increases the importance of strong, pulsed recruitment. This further supports the need for a maturation delay so that pulses do not immediately inflate adult numbers, which can over-smooth peaks if applied within the same year.
  - Other parameters remain within plausible bounds for coral-coral competition, bleaching, and COTS predation.

Chosen improvement:
- Add a one-year maturation delay for recruitment into the adult COTS population. Specifically:
  - Total recruits from (i) consumption-derived recruitment and (ii) immigration are split into:
    - an instantaneous adult addition fraction (1 - frac_rec_delay),
    - a delayed fraction frac_rec_delay that enters a one-year buffer and then matures to adults next year with survival juv_surv.
- Ecological justification:
  - COTS typically require about 10–12 months from larval stage to subadult/adult observations. Delayed recruitment is a well-known driver of oscillatory dynamics in predator populations and helps produce distinct boom-bust cycles.
  - With high m_C, peaks are sustained primarily by strong, pulsed recruitment; adding a delay improves both timing and amplitude, reducing the tendency to smear peaks across years.
- Mathematical approach:
  - Introduce a state memory (a single-step buffer) that stores the delayed component of recruitment. This is a simple, biologically grounded higher-order dynamic that adds minimal complexity but meaningful dynamics.
- Data leakage:
  - The implementation uses only previous-step predicted states and previous-step exogenous drivers (sst_dat, cotsimm_dat). It does not use current-step observations in process updates.

Expected effects on residuals and dynamics:
- Peaks are expected to occur later (by ~1 year) relative to the raw resource/immigration pulse, often improving phase alignment.
- Peak magnitudes can increase (delayed cohort stacks with intrinsic growth) while subsequent crashes remain governed by strong mortality and starvation, better capturing boom-bust character.
- If residuals currently show phase lead/lags or underpredicted peaks, this change should reduce those patterns.

Notes on parameter updates:
- Two new parameters (frac_rec_delay, juv_surv) are introduced with bounds [0, 1]. They provide flexibility for sites with different maturation and survival regimes. If future residuals indicate over- or under-delayed dynamics, frac_rec_delay can be tuned toward 0 or 1 accordingly.

Implementation summary:
- Model: Replace immediate addition of all recruitment with split immediate + delayed contributions; maintain a buffer variable across time steps.
- Parameters: Add frac_rec_delay and juv_surv with clear units, bounds, and descriptions.
