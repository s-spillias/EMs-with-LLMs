Assessment and rationale for structural improvement

1) Model fit to data and residuals
- Residuals file was not provided in this context, so a quantitative residual analysis could not be performed here. Qualitatively, the current single-stage adult model can reproduce gradual trends driven by food (coral cover), SST effects on larvae, and an Allee gate, but it lacks a mechanism to store reproductive output across multiple years and then release it under favorable conditions. This often results in smoother adult trajectories and can under-represent abrupt outbreak onsets and the multi-year persistence typical of COTS boom-bust cycles.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- Episodic outbreaks of COTS on the GBR are frequently attributed to spikes in larval survival and favorable conditions that translate into strong recruitment cohorts, followed by severe coral depletion, food limitation, and subsequent population collapse.
- The prior structure used same-year larval production contributing directly to next-year adults with a single fractional maturation. This provides a one-year lag but lacks a state buffer that can amplify outbreak dynamics.

3) Missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Absence of an explicit juvenile pool. Juveniles can persist for multiple years, providing a reservoir that matures into adults when food is abundant. This stage memory is an important trigger for sharp outbreak onsets and variable duration.
- Maturation not modulated by food availability. Adult diet is coral; where coral is abundant, maturation into the conspicuous, coral-feeding adult stage is more likely to succeed.

Chosen improvement (one meaningful change)
- Add an explicit juvenile stage with food-modulated maturation:
  J_{t+1} = sJ * J_t + L_t
  C_{t+1} = sA_t * C_t + mu_eff(Food_t) * J_t
  where mu_eff(Food_t) = invlogit(logit_mu_adult + gamma_mu_food * (Food_t - 0.5)).
- Ecological justification:
  - Juvenile persistence introduces a memory that can accumulate recruits across years.
  - Maturation that increases with Food (coral availability) allows “pulse release” into the adult population when coral cover has recovered, generating realistic outbreak timing and magnitude.
  - Adults still experience food-dependent survival; once coral cover is reduced by predation, Food drops, adult mortality rises, and the outbreak collapses, reproducing the characteristic boom-bust cycle.

Parameter updates and bounds
- log_mJ (juvenile mortality): new parameter. Plausible range 0.05–3.0 year^-1 (log bounds [-4.6, 1.1]). Controls persistence of juvenile pool.
- gamma_mu_food (food-to-maturation slope on logit scale): new parameter. Range [-10, 10]. Governs how strongly Food increases the probability of juvenile maturation to adults. gamma_mu_food = 0 recovers the original constant maturation fraction.
- log_J0 (initial juveniles at t=0): new parameter. Allows the fit to initialize an appropriate juvenile reservoir; plausible range corresponds to ~[0, 5] indiv m^-2 on the natural scale.

Interactions with existing parameters and literature updates
- The existing SST effects on larval survival (Topt_larv, Tsd_larv) remain intact and continue to modulate L_t. This is consistent with literature showing thermal sensitivity of larval performance. The addition of J introduces multi-year carryover without contradicting the thermal performance assumptions.
- No changes to the coral equations or predation functional response were needed to implement this improvement. The existing Hill-type saturation with exponent q_pred and smooth caps already avoid pathological over-removal when coral is scarce.
- The earlier update narrowing Topt_larv bounds is compatible with this structure; it refines where larval performance peaks but does not alter the need for juvenile buffering to capture episodic outbreaks.

Implementation notes
- The new state variable juv_pred is initialized from a parameter J0 and updated forward using only previous-step predictions (no use of current observations), preserving strict separation between data and state dynamics.
- The observation model is unchanged.
- Soft parameter penalties were added to keep new parameters within biologically plausible ranges, avoiding hard constraints.

Expected effect on dynamics and fit
- The model can now accumulate a juvenile reservoir during favorable larval years and then convert it to adults when coral food is abundant, enabling sharper outbreak onsets and more realistic boom-bust timing and duration.
- If residuals indicate systematic early under-prediction of outbreak peaks or overly smooth adult trajectories, this change should improve fit with limited additional complexity while maintaining ecological realism.

Next steps for evaluation
- After fitting, inspect posterior gamma_mu_food and log_mJ. Large positive gamma_mu_food and moderate-to-low mJ would indicate support for food-triggered maturation from a persistent juvenile pool.
- Examine predicted juv_pred: periods of accumulation preceding outbreaks would validate the intended mechanism.
