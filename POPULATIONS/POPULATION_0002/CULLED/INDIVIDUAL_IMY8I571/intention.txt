Assessment, model fit, and chosen improvement (revised after runtime issue):

1) Model fit to data
- Residuals file was not provided here; a quantitative residual inspection wasn’t possible. The model structure (stage-structured COTS with density dependence and selective predation on corals) can generate oscillations but may still smooth over abrupt recruitment surges that characterize episodic outbreaks.

2) Alignment with project context (episodic GBR outbreaks)
- Strengths: selective predation on fast vs. slow corals, thermal performance for coral growth and larvae, bleaching mortality, juvenile pool enabling lags, food-dependent maturation and adult survival, flexible Type-II/III predation.
- Gap noted previously: exogenous flood-driven nutrient pulses likely boost larval survival and trigger outbreaks.

3) Runtime constraint encountered
- The prior iteration added an exogenous nutrient_dat DATA_VECTOR and related parameters. The current pipeline does not provide nutrient_dat, causing a runtime failure during model setup.
- To restore functionality without changing the data interface, the explicit nutrient driver was removed for now. This avoids data-read failures and keeps the model operational.

4) Chosen ecological improvement (updated to avoid external data dependency)
- Implemented a nonlinear food limitation in reproduction: FoodRep_t = Food_t^(p_food), with p_food ≥ 1 recommended.
- Reproductive output becomes:
    L_t = phi * C_t * [Food_t^(p_food)] * EnvLarv_T(t) * exp(-beta * C_t) * A_gate_t + k_imm * cotsimm_dat(t)
- Ecological rationale: Outbreaks require not just food presence but high prey availability/quality; a superlinear response to food (p_food > 1) creates threshold-like recruitment surges once coral prey cover is sufficiently high, consistent with observed boom initiation. This adds only one parameter and preserves parsimony.
- Maturation and adult survival remain linearly food-modified to avoid over-amplifying feedbacks.

5) Parameter changes
- Added: log_p_food (controls p_food = exp(log_p_food)); suggested bounds correspond to p_food in [1, 5].
- Removed (temporarily): nutrient_dat, log_K_nutr, log_p_nutr due to missing exogenous nutrient input in the pipeline. When nutrient forcing becomes available, reinstating an explicit nutrient-driven larval modifier is recommended, potentially alongside (or replacing) the food nonlinearity if redundant.

6) Notes on ecological realism and identifiability
- The added nonlinearity can produce episodic recruitment while relying on existing state variables (no new data), maintaining compatibility with the current data pipeline.
- If future literature updates tighten fecundity scaling or density-dependence magnitudes, consider revisiting the functional form (e.g., double-sigmoid in food or combined temperature–nutrient envelope) to keep realism.
- Constraint: As required, the model never uses current time-step observed response variables in prediction; all dynamics use previous-step predictions and exogenous forcings.

7) Next steps (optional guidance)
- If/when nutrient/runoff or chlorophyll-a time series become available, replace or augment FoodRep with a nutrient-driven larval survival modifier to better capture flood-triggered outbreaks and their lags.
