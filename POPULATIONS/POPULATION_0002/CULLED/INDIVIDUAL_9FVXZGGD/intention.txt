Assessment and rationale

1) Fit to data:
- I did not receive the residuals file referenced in the task. Without residuals, I cannot quantify fit quality or identify temporal/structural biases. Please provide residuals to validate improvement impacts.
- Qualitatively, the original model can generate boom-bust cycles through food-limited fecundity, Allee gating, and adult survival feedbacks, but tends to synchronize adult peaks too closely to larval production because larvae directly become adults after one year via a fixed fraction.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT:
- The project focuses on episodic Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks with abrupt onset, large magnitude, and finite duration, driven by selective predation on Acropora and feedbacks with coral cover.
- A key ecological mechanism missing is an explicit juvenile reservoir: juveniles can persist for multiple years feeding on non-coral prey and transition to coral-feeding adults when coral becomes abundant. This reservoir allows sudden “release” into adulthood, improving outbreak timing and duration realism.

3) Oversimplifications and updated parameter implications:
- The parameter logit_mu_adult was originally interpreted as “fraction of larvae maturing to adults in 1 year.” This fixed one-year delay is restrictive and less consistent with evidence of multi-year juvenile stages and condition-dependent emergence.
- Rather than introduce external environmental drivers without data (e.g., nutrients/runoff), I incorporated the most relevant internal feedback: food-dependent juvenile maturation.
- I retained the existing food limitation in fecundity (Food) and adult survival, and added a maturation nonlinearity Food^{q_mature} to produce sharper outbreak triggers when coral (especially fast coral) is abundant.

Chosen improvement

Add a juvenile state with food-dependent maturation:
- New state J_t (juveniles, indiv/m^2).
- Larval production enters juveniles: L_t = phi * C_t * Food_t * EnvLarv_t * exp(-beta C_t) * A_gate_t + k_imm * cotsimm_dat(t).
- Juvenile dynamics: J_{t+1} = exp(-mJ) * J_t + L_t.
- Maturation: mu_J(Food_t) = mu_adult * Food_t^{q_mature}, with mu_adult in [0,1] the maximum annual maturation fraction and q_mature >= 1 controlling sensitivity to coral-derived food.
- Adult dynamics: C_{t+1} = sA_t * C_t + mu_J(Food_t) * J_t.
- This introduces at least a one-year developmental lag and allows cohort accumulation and rapid adult emergence when coral recovers, improving outbreak timing and persistence.

Ecological justification
- Juvenile bottlenecks and delayed emergence are well-documented in COTS and are critical to reproducing observed episodic dynamics.
- Using coral-derived Food for maturation ties emergence to prey availability and preference for Acropora, reinforcing selective predation feedbacks that drive outbreak magnitude and subsequent crashes.
- The added nonlinearity q_mature allows the data to calibrate how sharp the emergence trigger is without imposing hard thresholds.

Notes on unchanged structures
- I did not introduce differential bleaching between coral groups or additional environmental drivers to keep the change focused and interpretable.
- No current-time observations are used in prediction steps. Only previous-step predicted states and exogenous forcings contribute to updates.

Parameters added/modified
- log_mJ: juvenile mortality rate (year^-1). Soft bounds 0.05–3.0 year^-1.
- log_q_mature: food sensitivity exponent for maturation (dimensionless). Soft bounds 1–6 (via exp on log scale).
- log_J0: initial juvenile density at t=0 (indiv/m^2). Soft bounds 0–2 indiv/m^2.
- logit_mu_adult: reinterpreted as maximum annual juvenile-to-adult maturation fraction in [0,1] (previously: fraction of larvae maturing in one year).

Expected impacts
- More realistic outbreak timing (delayed adult peaks after larval pulses), greater capacity for episodic spikes, and improved collapse dynamics via food loss after selective coral predation.
- Once residuals are available, I recommend checking: (i) lag structure in adult peaks vs. larval immigration pulses, (ii) magnitude of peaks, and (iii) duration/persistence of elevated adult densities.

Request
- Please provide the residuals file so we can verify improved fit and tune q_mature and mJ accordingly.
