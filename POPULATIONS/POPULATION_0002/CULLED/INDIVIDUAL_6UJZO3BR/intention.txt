PROJECT ASSESSMENT AND MODEL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Summary
- The current model is a coupled coral–COTS system with:
  - Space-limited coral growth for fast (Acropora) and slow (Faviidae/Porites) corals.
  - Selective COTS predation with Type-III functional responses in coral prey.
  - Temperature-driven bleaching for corals via a smooth ramp.
  - Adult COTS survival modified by temperature and starvation (via coral-derived FoodSat).
  - COTS recruitment via a Ricker process with temperature and food multipliers, and external immigration.
  - Observation models: lognormal for COTS, logit-normal for coral proportions.
- This structure supports boom–bust cycles through:
  - Positive feedback: higher A drives higher recruitment until density dependence.
  - Negative feedback: coral depletion reduces FoodSat, increasing adult starvation and lowering recruitment.

1) Model fit evaluation
- Residuals file was referenced but not provided here. Without it, I cannot quantify fit or diagnose systematic biases (e.g., lagged peaks, outbreak magnitude, recovery rates).
- Please share the residuals file for targeted diagnostics (timing of peaks, amplitude, persistence, bias in low-density years).
- Qualitatively, the current structure often over-predicts recruitment at low adult densities and can initiate outbreaks too readily without a fertilization constraint.

2) Alignment with the project context
- Strengths:
  - Selective predation and differential coral responses are explicitly represented.
  - Temperature impacts on both bleaching and COTS vital rates are included.
  - Immigration allows for episodic seeding.
- Potential gaps relative to outbreak dynamics:
  - Broadcast spawning and fertilization success (Allee effect) is not represented; this is key to triggering outbreaks only when local adult densities exceed a threshold.
  - Larval ecology (nutrient-driven survival) is approximated indirectly by FoodSat; larvae feed on plankton rather than coral.
  - Stage structure (juvenile vs adult) is collapsed.
  - Predator control on juveniles is not modeled.
  - No explicit handling-time or predator interference in predation (though coral-side Type-III helps moderate removal at low coral cover).

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Depensatory recruitment at low adult density (fertilization success) is missing. This is critical for episodic outbreak initiation and preventing spurious growth from very low densities.
- Larval survival pulses driven by nutrients/river runoff are not included due to lack of a nutrient/Chl-a driver in the current data interface.
- Stage structure and predator interference could improve realism but add complexity and parameters.

4) Parameter review
- Topt_S was updated from literature (value 29.0 °C with tighter bounds 28–30 °C), which supports the survival-temperature relationship.
- Many parameters remain initial estimates (e.g., m_starv, a_food, a_temp, prefF raw logit), and may require re-estimation once structural changes are applied.
- The use of FoodSat to modify recruitment may be ecologically coarse: adult condition depends on coral, but larval food is planktonic. Keeping this multiplier is acceptable as a proxy for adult fecundity, but interpretation should be cautious.

Chosen improvement: Add an Allee (fertilization) effect to recruitment
- Rationale: COTS are broadcast spawners; fertilization success increases sharply with adult density. Below a threshold, recruitment is strongly suppressed, preventing outbreaks. Above it, recruitment increases rapidly, contributing to episodic booms. This mechanism is well-supported and directly addresses outbreak timing and threshold behavior without adding new data dependencies.
- Mathematical form:
    F_allee = A_prev^q / (A_prev^q + K_allee^q)
    Recruit = rA * A_prev * exp(-betaA * A_prev) * R_temp * R_food * F_allee
  where:
    - K_allee (ind m^-2) sets the density scale at which fertilization success reaches 50%.
    - q_allee (dimensionless, ≥1) controls steepness (higher -> more threshold-like).
- Expected effects:
  - Suppresses growth from very low adult densities, reducing spurious outbreak initiation.
  - Creates a clearer threshold for outbreak ignition, improving timing.
  - Interacts with immigration pulses: outbreaks become more episodic and realistic.
  - Supports faster collapse after coral depletion via existing starvation feedback.

Notes on alternative options considered
- Predator interference/handling time in predation: useful for coral dynamics but less directly linked to outbreak initiation.
- Nutrient-driven larval multipliers: ideal but requires an additional data driver.
- Stage-structured models: strong realism but heavier parameter burden and data requirements.

No data leakage
- The implementation uses only previous-step states (A_prev, F_prev, S_prev) and previous-step environment to compute transitions.

Next steps
- Refit with the added depensation and inspect residuals for outbreak timing, peak magnitude, and decay.
- If early-peak bias persists, consider temperature-dependent spawning timing or interference in predation.
- If late-peak bias persists, consider adding a mild adult interference term in predation or adjusting a_food interpretation/re-estimation.
