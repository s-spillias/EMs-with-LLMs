This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interactions with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
- Temperature-dependent reproduction and survival
- Density-dependent mortality
- Immigration of larvae from external sources
- Resource-dependent growth and reproduction

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
- Two distinct coral groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites)
- Different growth rates and carrying capacities
- Selective predation by COTS
- Temperature-dependent mortality

3. Key Mechanisms for COTS Outbreaks:
- Environmental triggers (temperature thresholds)
- Resource availability (coral cover)
- External larval supply
- Population feedback loops

The model uses coupled differential equations with Holling Type II functional responses for predation, temperature-modified vital rates, and smooth transition functions for biological thresholds. Observation error is modeled using log-normal distributions to handle multiple orders of magnitude in population changes.
