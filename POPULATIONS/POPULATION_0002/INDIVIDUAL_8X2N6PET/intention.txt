This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interactions with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS population growth through:
   - Temperature-dependent reproduction
   - Density-dependent survival
   - External larval immigration
   - Resource-dependent mortality

2. Coral dynamics for two functional groups:
   - Fast-growing Acropora species
   - Slow-growing massive corals (Faviidae and Porites)
   
3. Key mechanisms and feedbacks:
   - Selective COTS predation on different coral types
   - Temperature effects on COTS reproduction
   - Coral cover effects on COTS survival
   - Density-dependent COTS mortality
   
The model emphasizes accurate representation of outbreak triggers (temperature, immigration) and limiting factors (coral availability, density dependence) to capture the characteristic boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations.
