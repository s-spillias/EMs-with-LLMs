This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interactions with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
- Temperature-dependent reproduction and survival
- Density-dependent mortality
- Immigration of larvae from external sources
- Resource-dependent growth and survival

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
- Two coral functional groups (fast-growing Acropora, slow-growing massive corals)
- Different growth rates and susceptibility to COTS predation
- Recovery dynamics after disturbance

3. Key Mechanisms:
- Temperature effects on COTS reproduction and survival
- Selective predation preferences between coral types
- Coral cover thresholds affecting COTS survival
- External larval supply triggering outbreaks

The model uses Type II functional responses for COTS predation on corals and incorporates environmental forcing through sea surface temperature. Density dependence is implemented through smooth transitions rather than hard thresholds to ensure numerical stability.
