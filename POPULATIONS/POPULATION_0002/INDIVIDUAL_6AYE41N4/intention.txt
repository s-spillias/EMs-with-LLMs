This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their interactions with coral communities on the Great Barrier Reef. The model captures:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
- Temperature-dependent reproduction and survival
- Density-dependent mortality
- Immigration of larvae from external sources
- Resource-dependent growth and reproduction

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
- Two distinct coral groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites)
- Different growth rates and carrying capacities
- Selective predation by COTS with preference for fast-growing species
- Background mortality and environmental stress effects

3. Key Mechanisms for COTS Outbreaks:
- Temperature thresholds affecting reproduction
- External larval supply triggering outbreaks
- Coral abundance feedback on COTS survival
- Delayed density dependence in population regulation

The model uses differential equations with Holling Type II functional responses for predation, temperature-modified vital rates, and smooth transition functions for thresholds. Observation error is modeled using log-normal distributions to handle multiple orders of magnitude in population changes.
