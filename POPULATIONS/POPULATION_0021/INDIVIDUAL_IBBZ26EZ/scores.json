  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements a standard NPZ structure with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, Holling type-III grazing, assimilation of grazed biomass into zooplankton, and linear phytoplankton mortality. It differs from the TRUTH model in three main ways: (1) uptake in the candidate is single-factor Michaelis\u2013Menten (no explicit P-dependent light/inhibition factor present in TRUTH); (2) there is no explicit mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N) or k*P) in the candidate; (3) zooplankton mortality includes an additional quadratic term (density-dependent loss) in the candidate. Grazing, assimilation-to-Z, and the general mass\u2011balance recycling idea are present and map directly to the TRUTH formulations, though parameter names and exact partitioning differ.",
