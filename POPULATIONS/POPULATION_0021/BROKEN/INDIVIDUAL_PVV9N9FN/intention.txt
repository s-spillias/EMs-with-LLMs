This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine food web involving nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z) in a closed system, such as the oceanic mixed layer.

The model is based on the following interactions:
1. Phytoplankton growth is driven by the uptake of dissolved nutrients, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which means growth rate saturates at high nutrient concentrations.
2. Zooplankton graze on phytoplankton, with a Holling Type II functional response, where consumption rate saturates as phytoplankton become abundant.
3. A fraction of the grazed phytoplankton is assimilated by zooplankton for growth, while the rest is egested.
4. Both phytoplankton and zooplankton populations experience loss through a linear mortality term.
5. Dead organic matter from mortality and zooplankton egestion is remineralized back into the dissolved nutrient pool, closing the nutrient loop.

This structure creates a dynamic feedback system where predator-prey oscillations and nutrient cycling can be observed. The model is designed to be fitted to time-series data of N, P, and Z concentrations.
