  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake driving phytoplankton growth, Holling-type grazing transferring biomass to zooplankton, and mortality terms returning biomass to the nutrient pool. Uptake and growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH model's combined N- and self-shading/light limitation (N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) * P). Grazing is implemented as a Holling Type III P^2/(K_P^2+P^2)*Z which matches the TRUTH grazing functional form (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z) modulo parameter names. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient equation and omits an explicit mixing term in the phytoplankton equation that are present in TRUTH. The candidate adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term not present in TRUTH. Overall, several canonical processes are present but some are alternate formulations (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake) and one extra ecological process (quadratic zooplankton mortality) appears.",
