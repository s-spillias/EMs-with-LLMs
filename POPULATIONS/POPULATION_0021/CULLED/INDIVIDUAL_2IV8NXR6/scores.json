  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake feeding phytoplankton, grazing transferring carbon to zooplankton, and recycling back to nutrients) but uses different functional forms and omits physical mixing/entrainment terms that are present in the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limited growth (V_max\u00b7N/(K_N+N)\u00b7P) rather than the TRUTH product N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c P))*P. Grazing is Holling type II (I_max\u00b7P/(K_P+P)\u00b7Z) rather than the TRUTH sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Type III-like). Recycling is present via sloppy feeding, explicit zooplankton excretion, and a remineralization multiplier, but the mechanistic partitioning differs. The candidate adds explicit zooplankton excretion and density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality which are not in the TRUTH equations. The candidate also omits the mixing/entrainment terms (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P and any Z mixing) present in TRUTH. Numerically the candidate uses forward Euler integration (implementation detail) and a lognormal observation model.",
