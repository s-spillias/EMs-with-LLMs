This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton ecosystem, consisting of three key components: Nutrients (N), Phytoplankton (P), and Zooplankton (Z). The model follows a classic NPZ structure where nutrient availability limits phytoplankton growth, which in turn are grazed upon by zooplankton. Dead organic matter from both phytoplankton and zooplankton is remineralized, returning nutrients to the system. This framework captures the fundamental trophic interactions and nutrient cycling that govern plankton population dynamics in the oceanic mixed layer.
