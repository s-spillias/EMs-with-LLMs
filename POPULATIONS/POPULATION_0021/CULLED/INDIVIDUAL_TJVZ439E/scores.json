  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ structure (N uptake \u2192 P growth \u2192 Z growth with grazing and mortalities) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH model. Uptake is implemented as Michaelis\u2013Menten in N multiplied by a linear-in-P term (V_max * N/(K_n+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH two-factor form aP/(b + cP) * N/(e+N). Grazing is Holling type II (g_max * P/(K_p+P) * Z) rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) form. Recycling is present via sloppy_grazing and mortalities returned to N, but the candidate lacks the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0 - N) and k*P) and the TRUTH's separate loss terms (r, s, gamma partitioning). Zooplankton mortality and phytoplankton linear mortality are included; zooplankton growth uses assimilation efficiency explicitly. Overall the candidate matches the NPZ conceptual components but uses alternate standard functional forms (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling II grazing, linear mortality) and omits mixing/dilution and some TRUTH-specific partitioning parameters.",

The candidate omits the a/(b+cP) saturating-in-P factor and instead uses linear P, so it is an alternate Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake formulation."

TRUTH has beta*lambda_*P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z plus gamma*q*Z etc. The mechanism (recycling to N) is present but uses different functional forms/partitioning (Holling-II grazing and full zooplankton mortality to N rather than TRUTH's gamma fraction)."
