  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake-driven phytoplankton growth, Holling-type III grazing, assimilation of grazing to zooplankton, and linear mortality terms. It departs from the TRUTH formulation mainly in the uptake term (no explicit light/attenuation limiter a/(b+cP)), and by adding a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality. Nutrient recycling is present but realized via unassimilated grazing plus mortality fluxes rather than the exact beta/gamma partitioning in TRUTH. The candidate also omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss term present in TRUTH.",
