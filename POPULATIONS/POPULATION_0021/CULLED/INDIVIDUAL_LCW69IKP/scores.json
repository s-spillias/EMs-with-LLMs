  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake driving phytoplankton growth, Holling-III grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, and recycling via unassimilated grazing and mortality. Several terms match the TRUTH model family (Holling III grazing, Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, linear mortality), but the candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton and replaces some parameterizations (e.g., no explicit light/self-shading limitation). The candidate also includes an additional density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality term not present in the TRUTH model.",
