  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the standard NPZ roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling to nutrients, and mortality closures) but uses alternate functional forms in several places compared to the TRUTH model. Uptake/growth are implemented as simple Michaelis\u2013Menten (N-limited) rather than the TRUTH product of nutrient- and P-dependent terms (nutrient * light-like term). Grazing is Holling type II (saturating with exponent 1) vs the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (sigmoidal/Type III). Zooplankton mortality is quadratic (plus an explicit excretion loss) rather than the TRUTH's linear loss. Crucially, the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N) in TRUTH). The candidate also includes explicit \u2018\u2018sloppy feeding\u2019\u2019 and an explicit remineralization of mortality (lambda * (mu_P * P + mu_Z * Z^2)) that differ in form from the TRUTH recycling terms.",
