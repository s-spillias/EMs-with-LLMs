  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical ecological roles from the TRUTH model but with different mathematical choices. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a classical Michaelis\u2013Menten (Vmax * N/(K_N + N)) acting multiplicatively with P, rather than the TRUTH's combined N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) form (i.e. different nutrient and light limitation coupling). Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type III (sigmoidal) functional response on P, with an explicit assimilation efficiency feeding Z growth and (1 - beta) returned to N \u2014 so grazing + recycling are present but with different functional forms. Phytoplankton mortality is linear (matches TRUTH structurally), but the model omits an explicit mixing/entrainment term for N and P present in TRUTH. Zooplankton mortality in the candidate includes both linear and quadratic density-dependent terms (an addition relative to TRUTH which has only linear Z loss). Overall: most ecological processes are present but some are alternate formulations and one extra process (quadratic Z mortality) is introduced.",
