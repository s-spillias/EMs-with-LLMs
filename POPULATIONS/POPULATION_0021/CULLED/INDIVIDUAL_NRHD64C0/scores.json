  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N uptake -> P growth -> Z grazing -> Z mortality -> recycling) but uses simpler Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth (no explicit light/self-shading term) and adds explicit quadratic mortality for P and Z. Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type III (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) and assimilation is handled via an efficiency parameter (beta), so the grazing / zooplankton growth structure closely matches the TRUTH functional form. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N) in TRUTH) and instead treats all mortality fluxes as returning to nutrients (no fraction gamma for zooplankton mortality). Implementation choices (Euler integration, lognormal observation model) are numerical/observation-layer choices, not new ecological state variables.",

TRUTH used a combined N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c*P)) * P (nutrient + self-shading/light limitation).
