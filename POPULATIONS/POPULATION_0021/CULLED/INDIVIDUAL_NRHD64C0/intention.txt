Model Assessment:
The current model is a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) system. Its strengths include a Type III grazing function for zooplankton, which provides a prey refuge, and a quadratic mortality term for zooplankton, representing higher-order predation. The primary simplification is the phytoplankton mortality, which is purely linear (density-independent). This fails to capture self-limiting feedback mechanisms that often regulate phytoplankton blooms, such as viral lysis or accelerated sinking at high cell densities. The nutrient cycle is also simplified, with instantaneous remineralization of all waste and dead biomass.

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a quadratic mortality term for phytoplankton (m_P_sq * P^2).

Reasoning:
This improvement adds a critical ecological process of density-dependent mortality for phytoplankton. A linear mortality term alone is often insufficient to capture the dynamics of bloom collapse. By adding a quadratic term, the model can better simulate self-regulation within the phytoplankton population, where loss rates increase disproportionately at high densities. This is ecologically justified as it can represent processes like the spread of viral pathogens or increased aggregation and sinking during intense blooms. This change enhances the model's realism, improves its stability by preventing unbounded phytoplankton growth, and creates a more symmetrical representation of mortality pressures on both phytoplankton and zooplankton.
