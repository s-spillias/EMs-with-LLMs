  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, zooplankton grazing with assimilation efficiency, mortality, recycling, and deep-water mixing. Key differences from the TRUTH model: phytoplankton growth in the candidate uses a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (no explicit light/shading limitation term present in TRUTH), grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) Hill-type grazing in TRUTH, nutrient recycling is handled via explicit excretion + a single remineralization term rather than the TRUTH's partitioning, and phytoplankton physical mixing/entrainment loss is missing from the candidate (TRUTH had a -k*P term). Numerical integration in the candidate is explicit Euler (stepwise update) rather than solving ODEs continuously (implementation detail, not an ecological process). Overall, most canonical processes exist but some functional forms differ and phytoplankton mixing is omitted.",
