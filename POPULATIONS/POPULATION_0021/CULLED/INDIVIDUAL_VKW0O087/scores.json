  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with different functional forms than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake in the candidate is a classical Michaelis\u2013Menten N-dependence multiplied by P (V_max * N/(K_n+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH's compound form (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P))*P. Grazing in the candidate is Holling Type II (g_max * P/(K_p+P) * Z) vs the TRUTH's sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Holling III-style). Both models include recycling/excretion and linear mortalities, but the candidate returns sloppy feeding + both mortalities directly to nutrients (explicit sloppy_grazing and zooplankton_mortality added to dN_dt), whereas TRUTH has multiple named fractions (alpha, beta, gamma) with different placements. The candidate omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (no k*(N0-N) or (s+k)*P analogue). Numerically, the candidate uses forward Euler and enforces non-negativity and a lognormal observation model \u2014 these are numerical/observation model details, not new ecological processes.",
