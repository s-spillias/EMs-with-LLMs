  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Monod nutrient uptake, Holling type-III grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, and zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing. It differs from the TRUTH model in three main ways: (1) it omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P in TRUTH), (2) its nutrient-uptake lacks the additional P-dependent term a/(b + c P) present in TRUTH (so the candidate uses simpler Monod-growth), and (3) it includes an extra quadratic zooplankton mortality term (m_Z_sq * Z^2) not present in TRUTH. Overall most ecological roles are present but implemented with slightly different functional forms (Monod vs TRUTH's multiplicative P-dependence) and one extra density-dependent zooplankton mortality term is added.",
