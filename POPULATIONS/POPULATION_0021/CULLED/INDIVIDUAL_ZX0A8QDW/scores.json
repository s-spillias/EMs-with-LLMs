  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure with Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, a Type-III (sigmoidal) grazing functional response, assimilation of grazing to zooplankton, and explicit phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality terms. It departs from TRUTH primarily by omitting an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton, by using a simpler nutrient uptake (no light/biomass-dependent light limitation term), and by adding a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term. Several roles map directly to TRUTH (grazing functional form and assimilation-driven zooplankton growth; linear mortalities), while uptake and recycling are implemented in a commonly used alternate form.",
