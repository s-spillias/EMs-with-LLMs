  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological flows: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, phytoplankton grazing by zooplankton (Holling type III), recycling of unassimilated grazing and mortalities to nutrients, phytoplankton linear mortality, and zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing. Key differences vs TRUTH: uptake is a simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten form without the TRUTH model's P-dependent modifier (a/(b + c*P) factor), mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH are absent in the candidate, and the candidate adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term (m_Z_sq * Z^2) that is not in TRUTH. Parameter naming and mapping differ (e.g., candidate uses beta for assimilation, TRUTH used alpha), but the major predator\u2013prey closure (Holling III grazing and assimilation) is structurally the same.",
