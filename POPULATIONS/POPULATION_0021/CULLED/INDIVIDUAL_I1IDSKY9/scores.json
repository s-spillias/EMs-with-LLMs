  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, recycling to nutrients, phytoplankton mortality, and zooplankton mortality/growth. Many ecological roles in the TRUTH model are present but several model forms differ: the candidate uses Michaelis-Menten uptake in N (no explicit light-limitation factor present in TRUTH), Holling Type II grazing (TRUTH uses a saturating P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form similar to a Hill/Holling-III), linear phytoplankton mortality (matches TRUTH's linear term), but replaces TRUTH's linear zooplankton mortality with an explicit quadratic mortality plus a separate excretion term and explicit sloppy-feeding fraction. Also, the candidate lacks an explicit environmental mixing/dilution term for nutrients and phytoplankton analogous to TRUTH's k*(N0 - N) and the (s + k)*P term. Overall the candidate is ecologically plausible and matches many alternate forms in the literature, but is not algebraically identical to the TRUTH NPZ (several ALTERNATE matches and a few missing components).",
