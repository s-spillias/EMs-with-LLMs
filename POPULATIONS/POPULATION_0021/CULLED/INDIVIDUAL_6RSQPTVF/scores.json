  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with the core processes present: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton with assimilation, linear mortalities, nutrient recycling (excretion + remineralization), and physical mixing of nutrients. Functional forms differ in several places from the TRUTH model: the candidate uses a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (proportional to P), a Holling type II grazing (P/(k_p+P)), and aggregates remineralization from mortalities via a single rate. The candidate also omits an explicit phytoplankton loss term due to mixing (a P-proportional mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH). Numerical integration in the candidate is explicit Euler stepping rather than continuous ODE solving (TRUTH used solve_ivp), which is an implementation difference rather than an ecological term.",
