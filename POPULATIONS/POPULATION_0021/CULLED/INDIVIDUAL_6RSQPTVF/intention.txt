This model simulates the dynamics of a Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) system within the oceanic mixed layer. The model is based on the following ecological principles:

1.  **Phytoplankton Growth**: Phytoplankton (P) growth is dependent on the availability of a limiting nutrient (N). This nutrient uptake follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, meaning the growth rate saturates at high nutrient concentrations.

2.  **Zooplankton Grazing**: Zooplankton (Z) consume phytoplankton. This grazing pressure is modeled using a Holling Type II functional response, where the grazing rate per zooplankton individual saturates as phytoplankton become abundant.

3.  **Nutrient Cycling**: Nutrients are recycled through several pathways. Zooplankton grazing is not perfectly efficient; a fraction of the grazed phytoplankton is egested and immediately returned to the nutrient pool. Additionally, both phytoplankton and zooplankton are subject to mortality. The resulting dead organic matter is decomposed and remineralized back into the nutrient pool.

4.  **Physical Environment**: The model represents an open system, with the mixed layer exchanging water and nutrients with a deep-water reservoir at a constant rate. This process provides a source of new nutrients to the surface layer.

By integrating these processes, the model captures the fundamental trophic interactions and feedback loops that govern the population dynamics of a simple planktonic food web.
