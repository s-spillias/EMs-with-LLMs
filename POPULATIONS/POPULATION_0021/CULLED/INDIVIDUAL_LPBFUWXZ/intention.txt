Model Assessment:
The current model is a well-structured NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) model that captures the fundamental dynamics of a simple plankton ecosystem, aligning with the project's context. It employs standard and appropriate functional forms: Michaelis-Menten for nutrient uptake and a Holling Type III sigmoidal response for zooplankton grazing, which provides a refuge for phytoplankton at low densities. The inclusion of nutrient recycling from mortality and unassimilated grazing is a crucial feedback loop that is correctly implemented.

However, a key ecological process appears oversimplified. The phytoplankton mortality is represented by a single linear term (m_P * P), indicating a constant per-capita death rate regardless of population density. This is often unrealistic for phytoplankton blooms.

Proposed Improvement: Introduce Quadratic Phytoplankton Mortality

Reasoning:
At high concentrations, phytoplankton populations often experience increased loss rates due to density-dependent factors. The current linear mortality term fails to capture this. I am introducing a quadratic mortality term (m_P_sq * P^2) to the phytoplankton dynamics. This represents several key ecological processes:
1.  Self-shading: As phytoplankton density increases, cells shade each other, reducing light availability and leading to increased mortality.
2.  Viral Lysis: The transmission of phytoplankton-specific viruses is often density-dependent, leading to mass mortality events (lysis) at the peak or decline of a bloom.
3.  Increased Sinking: High-density blooms can form aggregates that sink out of the mixed layer more rapidly.

This change introduces a new parameter, `log_m_P_sq`, analogous to the existing `log_m_Z_sq` for zooplankton. This creates a more symmetric and ecologically realistic representation of mortality for both plankton groups. The mathematical form is a higher-order representation that should improve the model's ability to simulate the peak and subsequent crash of a phytoplankton bloom, a common feature in plankton dynamics that linear mortality struggles to replicate accurately.

While I cannot definitively assess model fit without access to residual data, this structural improvement is based on well-established ecological principles and is a common refinement for NPZ models.
