  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth and mortality) but uses somewhat different functional forms and bookkeeping than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake in the candidate is a single Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limited formulation multiplied by P (V_max * N/(K_N + N) * P), whereas TRUTH uses a multiplicative nutrient term and an additional light/shading-like factor a/(b + c*P). Grazing is implemented as a Holling-Type III (P^2/(K_P^2 + P^2)) in both models and thus matches the TRUTH grazing functional family exactly. Recycling and mortality are handled differently: the candidate returns unassimilated grazing and both linear and quadratic mortality of P and Z to nutrients, while TRUTH uses specific recycling terms (beta/alpha, gamma*q*Z) and linear losses. The candidate omits an explicit mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0 - N)) and for phytoplankton mixing, and it adds quadratic (density-dependent) mortality terms for P and Z that are not present in TRUTH. Numerical integration (forward Euler) and numerical safeguards (epsilon floors) are present in the candidate but are numerical rather than ecological processes.",
