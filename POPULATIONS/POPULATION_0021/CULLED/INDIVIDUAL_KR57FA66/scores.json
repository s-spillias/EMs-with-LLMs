  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with some important differences from the TRUTH Python model. Uptake/growth are implemented as a simple Michaelis-Menten nutrient-limited growth (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the compound nutrient+light-limited term in TRUTH. Grazing is Holling type\u2011III (P^2/(K_P^2+P^2)) which is the same functional family used in TRUTH (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)). Nutrient recycling is present via unassimilated grazing and mortality fluxes returned to N, but the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N)) present in TRUTH is missing. Zooplankton dynamics include assimilation of grazing and linear mortality like TRUTH, but the candidate also includes an extra quadratic zooplankton mortality term (m_Z_sq * Z^2) that is not in TRUTH. Numerical choices (forward Euler integration, epsilon flooring) and observation-error modeling are present but are non-ecological implementation details.",
