  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling type III grazing, assimilation of grazed material to zooplankton growth, and linear zooplankton mortality \u2014 but with some important differences vs the TRUTH model. Grazing and assimilated grazing match the TRUTH functional form (P^2/(const+P^2) * Z). Uptake/growth in the candidate is Monod in N multiplied by P (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) and lacks the explicit light/photophysiology factor present in TRUTH (a/(b + c*P)). The candidate recycles unassimilated grazing and both linear and quadratic zooplankton mortality back to nutrients, whereas TRUTH has mixing (k*(N0-N)) and different parameterized recycling terms (including a gamma*q*Z term). The candidate does not include a physical mixing/dilution term for nutrients or phytoplankton. An extra ecological process in the candidate is an explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality (density-dependent Z^2) returning to nutrients.",
