  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake feeding phytoplankton, Holling type-III grazing, assimilation-based zooplankton growth, and phytoplankton linear mortality. It matches the TRUTH model exactly for several functional forms (Holling-III grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, assimilated grazing driving Z), but departs in important ways: uptake lacks the TRUTH extra multiplicative term a/(b + c P) (so it is a simpler Michaelis\u2013Menten \u00d7 P form), the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and for phytoplankton, and zooplankton mortality includes an added quadratic density-dependent term (m_Z_sq * Z^2) that is not in TRUTH. Recycling is present (unassimilated grazing + mortality return to N) but implemented via different algebra (unassimilated fraction (1-beta)*grazing and full return of Z mortality including quadratic term) compared to TRUTH's combination of beta*...*Z, gamma*q*Z and r*P. Numerical integration and observation/error model are present in the candidate but are non-ecological implementation details.",
