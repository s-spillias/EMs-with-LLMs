  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit nutrient uptake, Holling type-III grazing, assimilation to zooplankton growth, and mortality-driven recycling. Key differences vs the TRUTH Python NPZ: (1) phytoplankton nutrient uptake is implemented as classic Michaelis-Menten (V_max*N/(K_N+N)) \u00d7 P and therefore omits the TRUTH's additional P-dependent light/self-shading factor (a/(b + c*P)); (2) the candidate recycles mortality and unassimilated grazing back to nutrients but does not include an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) or for phytoplankton (k*P) that appear in TRUTH; (3) zooplankton mortality in the candidate includes an extra quadratic (density-dependent) term (m_Z_sq * Z^2) not present in TRUTH. Many functional pieces match literature alternates: Michaelis-Menten uptake, Holling type-III grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, and a combination of linear+quadratic zooplankton mortality.",
