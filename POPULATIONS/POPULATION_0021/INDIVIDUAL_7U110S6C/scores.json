Uptake/growth are implemented as classical Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth (no explicit light/self-shading term present in TRUTH). Grazing is a Holling-type III (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) functional response in the candidate (TRUTH uses a similar P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form), and zooplankton growth is assimilation * grazing as in TRUTH. The candidate omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH and adds a quadratic (density-dependent) zooplankton mortality term that is not in TRUTH.",
