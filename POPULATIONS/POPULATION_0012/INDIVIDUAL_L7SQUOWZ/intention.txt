MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Age-structured COTS population with temperature-dependent maturation (Q10 formulation)
2. Dual recruitment pathways (immigration + local spawning feedback)
3. Asymmetric thermal performance curves for corals (warming more damaging than cooling)
4. Type II functional response for realistic predation saturation
5. Multiple mortality mechanisms (age-dependent, Allee, density, food limitation)

Critical Gap Identified:
The model LACKS explicit coral recruitment mechanisms. Currently, corals only grow through logistic growth and decline through COTS predation. This creates an unrealistic scenario where:
- Heavily depleted coral populations cannot recover through larval recruitment
- The characteristic boom-bust cycles with recovery phases cannot be fully captured
- Long-term dynamics are biased toward coral extinction rather than cyclical recovery

This is particularly problematic for the PROJECT CONTEXT, which emphasizes "boom-bust cycles" and requires the model to capture both outbreak phases AND recovery phases.

=== ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT ===

Real coral reef dynamics include:
1. Pulse recruitment events following favorable environmental conditions
2. Temperature-dependent larval settlement success (optimal thermal windows)
3. Density-dependent recruitment:
   - Allee effects at low cover (reduced fertilization, fewer larvae)
   - Reduced recruitment at high cover (space limitation, competition)
4. Life history differences:
   - Fast corals (Acropora): High recruitment potential, opportunistic colonizers
   - Slow corals (Porites/Faviidae): Lower recruitment, more persistent

Without recruitment, the model cannot represent:
- Post-outbreak coral recovery (essential for cyclical dynamics)
- Resilience mechanisms that allow reefs to persist despite repeated disturbances
- The competitive dynamics between fast and slow coral strategies

=== PROPOSED MODIFICATION ===

Add explicit coral recruitment terms with:

1. **Temperature-dependent larval settlement**:
   - Gaussian thermal response centered on optimal settlement temperature
   - Fast corals: Higher optimal temperature, narrower tolerance (specialist)
   - Slow corals: Lower optimal temperature, broader tolerance (generalist)

2. **Density-dependent recruitment (Beverton-Holt form)**:
   - Allee effects at low cover (reduced when cover < threshold)
   - Saturation at high cover (space limitation)
   - Different parameterization for fast vs slow corals

3. **Life history differentiation**:
   - Fast corals: High maximum recruitment rate (opportunistic)
   - Slow corals: Lower maximum recruitment rate (persistent)

Mathematical form:
recruitment_fast = R_max_fast * temp_response_fast * (cover_fast / (cover_fast + allee_threshold_fast)) * (1 / (1 + cover_fast/space_limitation_fast))
recruitment_slow = R_max_slow * temp_response_slow * (cover_slow / (cover_slow + allee_threshold_slow)) * (1 / (1 + cover_slow/space_limitation_slow))

This creates a more complete representation of coral population dynamics that can support the full boom-bust cycle:
COTS outbreak → coral depletion → COTS crash (food limitation) → coral recovery (recruitment) → potential next outbreak

=== NEW PARAMETERS REQUIRED ===

1. log_recruit_max_fast: Maximum recruitment rate for fast corals (year⁻¹)
2. log_recruit_max_slow: Maximum recruitment rate for slow corals (year⁻¹)
3. temp_optimal_settlement_fast: Optimal temperature for fast coral larval settlement (°C)
4. temp_optimal_settlement_slow: Optimal temperature for slow coral larval settlement (°C)
5. log_temp_sensitivity_settlement_fast: Thermal sensitivity of fast coral settlement (°C⁻²)
6. log_temp_sensitivity_settlement_slow: Thermal sensitivity of slow coral settlement (°C⁻²)
7. log_allee_threshold_fast: Allee threshold for fast coral recruitment (% cover)
8. log_allee_threshold_slow: Allee threshold for slow coral recruitment (% cover)
9. log_space_limitation_fast: Space limitation parameter for fast coral recruitment (% cover)
10. log_space_limitation_slow: Space limitation parameter for slow coral recruitment (% cover)

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

1. Coral populations can recover after COTS outbreaks decline
2. Recovery rates differ between fast (rapid) and slow (gradual) corals
3. Temperature variability affects both COTS outbreaks AND coral recovery
4. Full boom-bust cycles emerge: outbreak → depletion → crash → recovery → repeat
5. Model can capture long-term persistence of coral-COTS dynamics rather than collapse

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT requirement to "predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles" by enabling the complete cycle including recovery phases.
