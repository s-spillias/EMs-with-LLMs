Assessment:
The current model captures the rapid outbreak and bust dynamics of COTS; however, residual analysis indicates that the decline phase is underestimated. This suggests that the resource limitation mechanism—based solely on a quadratic term—may be oversimplified. 

Chosen Improvement:
To better reflect the ecological complexity of coral competition, we add a cubic term in the saturating function for coral availability. The new parameter "resource_competition" modulates this cubic term, representing interspecific competition among coral species. This improvement should enhance the model's ability to capture non-linear feedbacks in resource uptake, thereby refining both the outbreak magnitude and duration predictions.
