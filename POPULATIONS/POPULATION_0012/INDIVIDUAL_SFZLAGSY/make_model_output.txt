Below are the proposed changes. I have chosen to incorporate an indirect feedback mechanism by letting normalized coral cover affect the outbreak trigger. In other words, the model now uses past coral availability (a combination of fast‐ and slow‐growing coral predictions) to modulate the likelihood of a COTS outbreak. This reflects the ecological insight that when coral  
cover is high, outbreaks are more likely, while very low coral cover will reduce outbreak potential. This improvement both addresses the project context by capturing more of the ecological interactions and helps explain some of the residual variance observed.

 The current model effectively captures the rapid boom-bust cycles of COTS through logistic growth and outbreak triggers, and it incorporates resource limitation via coral availability in the growth term. However, the outbreak trigger currently relies solely on the previous COTS state, ignoring a key ecological feedback: coral cover can indirectly influence the likelihood 
 of an outbreak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, I have introduced an indirect feedback mechanism where the normalized coral cover (combining fast- and slow-growing coral predictions) modulates the outbreak trigger. A new parameter, "outbreak_coral_sensitivity", governs how sensitive the outbreak trigger is to deviations in coral cover. This enhancement reflects that abundant coral may facilitate       
 outbreak initiation, while severely degraded coral conditions may dampen outbreak potential, thus improving the ecological realism of the model.

After applying these changes, you can compile the model as usual to assess the new dynamics and check how the residuals behave.
