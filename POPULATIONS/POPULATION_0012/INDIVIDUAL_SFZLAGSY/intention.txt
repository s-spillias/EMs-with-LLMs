Assessment and Improvement:
The current model effectively captures the rapid boom-bust cycles of COTS through logistic growth and outbreak triggers, and it incorporates resource limitation via coral availability in the growth term. However, the outbreak trigger currently relies solely on the previous COTS state, ignoring a key ecological feedback: coral cover can indirectly influence the likelihood of an outbreak. 
To address this, I have introduced an indirect feedback mechanism where the normalized coral cover (combining fast- and slow-growing coral predictions) modulates the outbreak trigger. A new parameter, "outbreak_coral_sensitivity", governs how sensitive the outbreak trigger is to deviations in coral cover. This enhancement reflects that abundant coral may facilitate outbreak initiation, while severely degraded coral conditions may dampen outbreak potential, thus improving the ecological realism of the model.
