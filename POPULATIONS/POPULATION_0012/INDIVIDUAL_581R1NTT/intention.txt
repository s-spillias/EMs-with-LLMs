MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a comprehensive mechanistic framework for COTS-coral dynamics with:
- Temperature-dependent recruitment with Gaussian thermal response
- Nutrient-mediated larval survival creating outbreak triggers
- Age-structured COTS population (juvenile/adult with different mortality rates)
- Temperature-dependent maturation rate (Q10 formulation)
- Local spawning feedback sustaining outbreaks
- Type II functional response for coral predation
- Temperature-dependent coral growth with Gaussian thermal performance curves

Parameter review reveals that temp_optimal_slow has been constrained to 27.0°C based on literature evidence (bounds: 27.0 to 27.000000027), indicating strong empirical support for this specific value.

=== KEY ECOLOGICAL GAP IDENTIFIED ===

The current model treats thermal performance curves symmetrically (Gaussian) and uses similar mathematical forms for both coral functional groups. However, ecological literature and the tight constraint on temp_optimal_slow suggest:

1. Massive corals (slow-growing Porites, Faviidae) are more thermally tolerant with BROADER performance curves
2. Acropora (fast-growing) are more thermally sensitive with NARROWER performance curves  
3. Thermal stress above optimal temperatures is MORE DAMAGING than equivalent cooling below optimal (asymmetric response)
4. This differential thermal tolerance affects coral community composition during warm periods, which in turn affects COTS food availability and outbreak dynamics

The current symmetric Gaussian formulation with similar sensitivity parameters for both groups does not capture these critical differences in thermal resilience.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Implement ASYMMETRIC THERMAL PERFORMANCE CURVES with differential sensitivity above vs below optimal temperature:

For temperatures BELOW optimal: Use current Gaussian decay (moderate impact)
For temperatures ABOVE optimal: Use steeper decay representing bleaching stress (severe impact)

Mathematical form:
- If T < T_optimal: growth_modifier = exp(-sensitivity_cool * (T - T_optimal)²)
- If T ≥ T_optimal: growth_modifier = exp(-sensitivity_warm * (T - T_optimal)²)

Where sensitivity_warm > sensitivity_cool, creating asymmetric response.

This allows:
- Fast corals to have high sensitivity_warm (vulnerable to heat stress, narrow thermal tolerance)
- Slow corals to have lower sensitivity_warm (resistant to heat stress, broad thermal tolerance)
- Both groups to have moderate sensitivity_cool (cooling less damaging than heating)

=== ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION ===

1. REALISM: Coral bleaching occurs primarily during warm anomalies, not cold anomalies. Asymmetric curves capture this biological reality.

2. DIFFERENTIAL VULNERABILITY: Acropora bleach and die at lower thermal stress levels than massive Porites, affecting COTS food availability differently during warm periods.

3. OUTBREAK DYNAMICS: When warm events preferentially remove fast corals (preferred COTS prey), this can:
   - Reduce COTS food availability, increasing food limitation mortality
   - Shift community toward slow corals, reducing COTS attack rates
   - Create boom-bust dynamics where thermal events interact with predation

4. LITERATURE SUPPORT: The tight constraint on temp_optimal_slow (27.0°C) combined with broader tolerance suggests the model should capture not just the optimum but the SHAPE of thermal tolerance.

=== IMPLEMENTATION ===

New parameters added:
- log_temp_sensitivity_fast_cool: Sensitivity to cooling for fast corals (moderate)
- log_temp_sensitivity_fast_warm: Sensitivity to warming for fast corals (high - vulnerable)
- log_temp_sensitivity_slow_cool: Sensitivity to cooling for slow corals (moderate)  
- log_temp_sensitivity_slow_warm: Sensitivity to warming for slow corals (low - resistant)

Original parameters removed:
- log_temp_sensitivity_fast (replaced by separate cool/warm parameters)
- log_temp_sensitivity_slow (replaced by separate cool/warm parameters)

This modification maintains model parsimony while adding critical ecological realism for capturing COTS outbreak dynamics in the context of thermal variability on the Great Barrier Reef.

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

1. Better prediction of coral community shifts during warm periods
2. More realistic COTS food limitation dynamics
3. Improved capture of boom-bust cycles where thermal stress and predation interact
4. Enhanced ability to predict outbreak timing relative to thermal anomalies
