MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Temperature-dependent COTS recruitment with Gaussian response around optimal temperature
2. Nutrient-mediated larval survival using SST proxy for bloom conditions
3. Age-structured mortality (juvenile vs. adult) with temperature-dependent maturation via Q10
4. Local spawning feedback mechanism enabling self-sustaining outbreaks
5. Type II functional response for coral predation with handling time
6. Multiple density-dependent processes (Allee, crowding, food limitation)

Weaknesses identified:
1. Coral growth rates are temperature-independent, creating asymmetry (COTS processes are temperature-dependent but coral recovery is not)
2. No thermal performance curves for coral growth despite well-documented temperature effects
3. Missing differential thermal optima between fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (massive) corals
4. Coral recovery after outbreaks may be unrealistic under varying temperature regimes

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT SELECTED ===

TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT CORAL GROWTH RATES

Rationale:
- Coral growth is strongly temperature-dependent with optimal growth at 26-28°C
- Fast-growing Acropora typically have higher thermal optima (~28°C) than massive corals (~27°C)
- Growth declines at both cooler and warmer temperatures (thermal performance curve)
- This creates realistic asymmetry: warm temperatures may favor COTS maturation while simultaneously stressing corals
- Critical for predicting coral recovery trajectories after outbreaks
- Increasingly important under climate change scenarios

Implementation approach:
- Add thermal performance curves (TPCs) for both fast and slow coral growth
- Use Gaussian/bell-shaped response curves centered on optimal temperatures
- Separate optimal temperatures: temp_optimal_fast (~28°C) and temp_optimal_slow (~27°C)
- Separate thermal sensitivity parameters: log_temp_sensitivity_fast and log_temp_sensitivity_slow
- Modify coral growth equations to multiply baseline growth rates by temperature response

Mathematical form:
temp_response_fast = exp(-temp_sensitivity_fast * (SST - temp_optimal_fast)^2)
temp_response_slow = exp(-temp_sensitivity_slow * (SST - temp_optimal_slow)^2)

fast_logistic_growth = fast_growth * temp_response_fast * fast_prev * (1 - fast_prev / fast_carrying_cap)
slow_logistic_growth = slow_growth * temp_response_slow * slow_prev * (1 - slow_prev / slow_carrying_cap)

New parameters added:
1. temp_optimal_fast: Optimal temperature for fast coral growth (°C), initial value 28.0°C
2. temp_optimal_slow: Optimal temperature for slow coral growth (°C), initial value 27.0°C
3. log_temp_sensitivity_fast: Log thermal sensitivity for fast corals (°C^-2), initial value -1.5
4. log_temp_sensitivity_slow: Log thermal sensitivity for slow corals (°C^-2), initial value -1.5

Expected ecological outcomes:
1. More realistic coral recovery dynamics following outbreaks
2. Temperature-mediated trade-offs: warm years may favor COTS but stress corals
3. Differential responses between coral types under varying thermal regimes
4. Better prediction of outbreak-recovery cycles under climate variability
5. Improved model realism for climate change scenarios

=== EQUATIONS MODIFIED ===

EQUATION 16 (Fast coral logistic growth):
OLD: fast_logistic_growth = fast_growth * fast_prev * (1 - fast_prev / fast_carrying_cap)
NEW: fast_logistic_growth = fast_growth * temp_response_fast * fast_prev * (1 - fast_prev / fast_carrying_cap)

EQUATION 19 (Slow coral logistic growth):
OLD: slow_logistic_growth = slow_growth * slow_prev * (1 - slow_prev / slow_carrying_cap)
NEW: slow_logistic_growth = slow_growth * temp_response_slow * slow_prev * (1 - slow_prev / slow_carrying_cap)

=== JUSTIFICATION FOR COMPLEXITY ===

This addition is justified because:
1. Temperature effects on coral growth are well-documented and quantifiable
2. Adds only 4 parameters (2 optima, 2 sensitivities) - minimal complexity increase
3. Creates ecologically realistic asymmetry in temperature effects
4. Critical for capturing outbreak-recovery dynamics under variable thermal regimes
5. Uses same mathematical form (Gaussian) already employed for COTS recruitment
6. Improves model applicability to climate change scenarios without major structural changes
