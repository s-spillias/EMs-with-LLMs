This revision addresses discrepancies noted in the residuals analysis and improves the ecological realism of outbreak dynamics.

Assessment:
- While the current model captures boom-bust cycles, its representation of resource limitation—via a basic Michaelis–Menten function—appears overly simplistic.
- The data suggest that the influence of coral availability on COTS growth exhibits sharper thresholds and non-linear responses.

Chosen Improvement:
- We introduce a Hill function with an adjustable exponent ("resource_limitation_exponent") to model the non-linear scaling of coral availability.
- This modification reflects that, ecologically, increases in coral cover may produce either disproportionately high or low effects on COTS growth, depending on system state.
