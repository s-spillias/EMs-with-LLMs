Assessment:

1. The model fits the data moderately well but shows systematic residuals near the outbreak onset, suggesting that the logistic outbreak trigger may be oversimplified.
2. The current formulation, which depends linearly on the previous COTS density, does not fully capture the abrupt transition observed in real outbreaks.
3. To better reflect the non-linear threshold dynamics, we introduce a quadratic correction of the normalized COTS density. This adjustment improves the ecological realism by representing increased sensitivity at moderate densities.

Chosen Improvement:
Incorporate a quadratic term (normalized_density^2) in the outbreak trigger calculation. This ensures that when the COTS population reaches around half the carrying capacity, the outbreak trigger shifts more abruptly, aligning with the observed boom‚Äêbust dynamics.
