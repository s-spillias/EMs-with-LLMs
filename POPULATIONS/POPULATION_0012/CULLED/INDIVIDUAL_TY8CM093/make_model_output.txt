Below is our proposed revision. We assessed that the current model fits well in terms of outbreak timing via the logistic trigger, but the resource‐limitation mechanism using coral availability is oversimplified. Using a higher‐order non‐linear (polynomial) transformation better captures saturating dynamics in resource uptake, reflecting diminishing returns in available   
coral at high cover levels. We therefore add a new parameter, coral_availability_exp, and update the resource factor calculation in the COTS growth equation. This improvement better reflects ecological realism while respecting the requirement to use only previous state values.

 the resource limitation mechanism using coral availability is oversimplified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 To more realistically capture diminishing returns in coral uptake, we introduce a higher‐order non‐linear term
