We assessed that while the current model captures the outbreak timing through the logistic outbreak_trigger,
the resource limitation mechanism using coral availability is oversimplified.
To more realistically capture diminishing returns in coral uptake, we introduce a higher‐order non‐linear term 
by raising coral_availability to an exponent. We add the parameter "coral_availability_exp" (default 2.0) to control 
this non‐linearity. This ecological improvement reflects more realistic saturation dynamics in resource limitation.
