Assessment:
The current model fits the temporal dynamics of COTS outbreaks reasonably well overall, yet it oversimplifies the coral predation process by treating predation efficiency as constant. Ecologically, as coral cover increases, predation efficiency should saturate (i.e., exhibit diminishing returns) due to limitations in predator foraging behavior. To address this, we have introduced a variable predation efficiency modulated by the new parameter "coral_predation_decay". This improved representation will better capture the boom-and-bust cycles by incorporating dynamic predator-prey feedback.
