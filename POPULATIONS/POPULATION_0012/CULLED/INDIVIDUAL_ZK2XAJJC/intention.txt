Project Assessment:
-------------------
The current model successfully captures the general boom‐bust cycles of COTS via logistic growth and a smooth outbreak trigger. However, residual analysis suggests that the outbreak initiation may be too gradual, missing the abrupt transition observed ecologically. 

Ecological Improvement:
We propose incorporating a quadratic acceleration factor in the outbreak trigger. By adding the new parameter `outbreak_acceleration`, the model now computes an "excess" value (the amount by which the COTS population exceeds the outbreak threshold) and applies a squared term in the exponent. This adjustment captures nonlinear tipping‐point behavior observed in outbreak dynamics and improves model fidelity while preventing any data leakage (only previous time step predictions are used).

Changes reflect the ecological reality of sudden outbreaks triggered by feedbacks not captured in the linear term.
