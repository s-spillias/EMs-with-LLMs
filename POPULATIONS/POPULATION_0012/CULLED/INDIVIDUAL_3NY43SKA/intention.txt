Assessment:
The current model captures the boom-bust outbreak dynamics reasonably well but shows systematic residual discrepancies at low coral cover. This suggests that the use of a constant coral_predation_efficiency oversimplifies the ecological reality.
 
Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, "min_predation_efficiency", to represent a lower bound on predation efficiency when coral cover is low. Ecologically, when coral is scarce, COTS may experience a drop in their efficiency due to increased search costs and reduced encounter rates. The revised formulation uses a nonlinear saturating function that transitions from min_predation_efficiency at low coral cover to coral_predation_efficiency at higher cover, thereby better capturing non-linear foraging dynamics and resource limitation.
