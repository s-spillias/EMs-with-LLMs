Assessment and Reasoning:

The current model fits the data reasonably well but tends to underestimate the rapid escalation observed in some outbreak periods. Residuals indicate that the outbreak initiation may be sharper than the present quadratic amplification allows. To address this, a cubic term (outbreak_cubic_factor) is added to the outbreak trigger function. Ecologically, this new parameter captures potential synergistic effects at very high COTS densities, where small increases in density can lead to disproportionate outbreak acceleration. This adjustment refines the model's ability to predict both the timing and magnitude of outbreaks while maintaining the use of only previous time step values for predictions.
