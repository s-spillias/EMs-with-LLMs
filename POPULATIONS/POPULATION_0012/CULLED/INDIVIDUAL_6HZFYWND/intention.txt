Assessment and Revision Log:
----------------------------------------------
After evaluating the current model and its residuals, we observed that the independent recovery equations for fast-growing and slow-growing corals do not capture the ecological reality of competition for space. In reef systems, both coral types share the same substrate, setting a natural upper limit (e.g., 100% total cover). Treating the recovery dynamics independently may lead to unrealistic overestimation of available coral cover.
To address this, we have modified the recovery terms in the model such that the potential recovery is limited by the gap between the maximum cover (100%) and the combined current cover of fast and slow coral. This change introduces an ecologically meaningful competitive constraint on coral recovery, and should capture the boomâ€“bust cycles more accurately by ensuring that coral recovery slows as total coral cover increases.
