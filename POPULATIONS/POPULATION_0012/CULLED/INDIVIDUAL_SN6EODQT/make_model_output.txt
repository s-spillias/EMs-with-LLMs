Below are the changes based on the assessment. In our evaluation, we noted that while the model well‐captures outbreak timing and decline, the linear coral recovery term (using the gap “100 − coral”) oversimplifies what is usually a logistic recovery process due to intra‐specific competition and resource saturation. Therefore, we modify the equations for both fast- and    
slow-growing corals so that recovery now is proportional to the current cover (i.e. follows logistic growth dynamics) rather than solely the deficit to maximum cover. This change increases ecological realism while still relying only on past prediction values.

 The current model reasonably captures the episodic dynamics of COTS with realistic outbreak-triggered decline. However, the recovery of coral communities is represented linearly (i.e., proportional to the gap from 100% cover), which may oversimplify the actual logistic recovery dynamics subject to intraspecific competition and resource saturation.                         
 To enhance ecological realism, the coral recovery terms for both fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. have been modified to follow logistic recovery dynamics. Now, recovery is proportional to both the existing coral cover and the remaining gap to maximum cover. This implies that recovery is slow when coral cover is near zero and saturates as  
 cover advances, reflecting more realistic regenerative processes.

Below are three SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_SN6EODQT/model.cpp that add safeguards to ensure predicted values do not become negative.                                                                                                                                                                                                             

In the first block, we wrap the COTS prediction in an fmax(..., eps) call. The second and third blocks do the same for the fast‐ and slow‐growing coral predictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Make sure that the function fmax (from <algorithm> or the standard library) is available in your build environment. If needed, you can add #include <algorithm> near the top of the file.

After applying these changes, you should avoid negative values propagating through your model and prevent the NA/NaN gradient evaluation error.

Below are three SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_SN6EODQT/model.cpp that replace the usage of fmax(…, eps) with the conditional operator so that the expressions work with templated types.

Below are three SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_SN6EODQT/model.cpp that refactor the three equations to use temporary variables for the update values before enforcing the non-negativity constraint. This restructuring improves numerical stability and should help resolve the NA/NaN gradient evaluation issue.

After applying these changes, the temporary variable assignments should help avoid potential numerical issues with the inline conditional operator, and the gradient evaluation error should be mitigated.

Fixing broken model iteration: 3
Below are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_SN6EODQT/model.cpp. These changes introduce a local variable to force a non‐negative carrying capacity (used in denominators and outbreak trigger expressions) and update all occurrences accordingly.

This block inserts a new line after the initial conditions so that all divisions using carrying_capacity instead use the safe value stored in “cap”.
