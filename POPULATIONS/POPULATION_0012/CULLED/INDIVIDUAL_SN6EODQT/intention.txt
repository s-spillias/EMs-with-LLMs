[Assessment]
The current model reasonably captures the episodic dynamics of COTS with realistic outbreak-triggered decline. However, the recovery of coral communities is represented linearly (i.e., proportional to the gap from 100% cover), which may oversimplify the actual logistic recovery dynamics subject to intraspecific competition and resource saturation. 
To enhance ecological realism, the coral recovery terms for both fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. have been modified to follow logistic recovery dynamics. Now, recovery is proportional to both the existing coral cover and the remaining gap to maximum cover. This implies that recovery is slow when coral cover is near zero and saturates as cover advances, reflecting more realistic regenerative processes.
Note: All predictions use only previous time step values, ensuring no data leakage from current observations.
