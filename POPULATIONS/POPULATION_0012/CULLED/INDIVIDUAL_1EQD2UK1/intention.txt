Assessment:
The current model captures outbreak dynamics via logistic growth and a smooth outbreak trigger. However, it uses a linear density‐dependent term (1 - N/K) in the logistic growth, which may oversimplify the non‐linear ecological processes observed during COTS outbreaks. 

Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, "growth_exponent", to raise the (1 - N/K) term to a power. When values are greater than 1, this produces a sharper decline in growth as density increases, thereby capturing threshold‐like transitions and more abrupt outbreak onsets. This refined formulation is ecologically justified to better model the rapid transition into outbreak and collapse phases observed in COTS dynamics.

The modification avoids using current time step observation data for predictions; only past state values (cots_pred[t-1]) are used.
