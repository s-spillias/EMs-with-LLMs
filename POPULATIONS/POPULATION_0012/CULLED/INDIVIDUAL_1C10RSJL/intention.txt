Assessment and Model Improvement:
-----------------------------------
Assessment:
Current model dynamics capture the overall boom-bust pattern, but residual analysis indicates that the timing and magnitude of outbreaks could be better explained. In particular, the model currently lacks an explicit mechanism linking fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp.) to COTS reproductive potential, which is an important ecological feedback.

Improvement:
To capture this resource dependence, we incorporate a modification to the COTS growth term. The effective growth rate now depends on the previous time step’s fast-growing coral cover. This approach reflects that higher coral cover increases the availability of resources for COTS larvae (i.e., improved recruitment), thereby enhancing outbreak initiation dynamics.

Changes:
1. A new parameter 'coral_effect_on_growth' is added to modulate the COTS growth rate based on fast-growing coral cover.
2. The growth term in the model is updated to use an effective growth rate computed as:
   effective_growth_rate = growth_rate_cots + coral_effect_on_growth * (fast_pred[t-1] / 100.0)
   
This added mechanism aims to enhance the model’s ability to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak cycles.
