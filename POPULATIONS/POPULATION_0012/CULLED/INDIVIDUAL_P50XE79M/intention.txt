Assessment:
The model effectively captures the COTS outbreak dynamics and coral predation processes. However, the coral recovery dynamics are oversimplified as they do not account for interspecific competition for space. To address this, I introduced a competition mechanism where the recovery rates of both fast-growing and slow-growing corals are modulated by the available space (i.e. 100 minus the combined coral cover). This improvement better captures ecological limitations and should improve the prediction of the magnitude and duration of recovery phases following outbreaks.
