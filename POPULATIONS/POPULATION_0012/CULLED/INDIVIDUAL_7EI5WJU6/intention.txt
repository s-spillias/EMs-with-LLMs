Assessment & Improvement Rationale:
The current model reasonably captures boom‐bust cycles in COTS populations, but the outbreak trigger function (a logistic function) appears overly simplistic. In nature, outbreak initiation often exhibits abrupt transitions that a simple logistic curve may not fully capture.
To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_trigger_exponent", to modulate the sensitivity of the outbreak trigger. Setting values greater than 1 will create a sharper, threshold‐like response, better reflecting ecological feedback mechanisms observed in episodic outbreaks.
This improvement enhances the model’s ability to predict the timing and intensity of COTS outbreaks without using current time step values.
