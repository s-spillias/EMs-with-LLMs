Assessment and Improvement Justification:

1. Model Evaluation:
   - The current model captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS using logistic growth and an outbreak-triggered decline. However, residual analysis has indicated that the model tends to overestimate growth during periods when coral cover is already low, suggesting that available resources may be limiting further outbreak growth.
   
2. Project Context Alignment:
   - Given the focus on accurately predicting outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration, it is ecologically critical to represent the interaction between COTS and their coral prey. Selective predation depletes coral communities, which in turn should feedback on the potential for continued outbreak growth.

3. Chosen Improvement â€“ Resource Limitation:
   - The improvement introduces a mechanism where COTS growth is scaled by the available coral cover (computed as the combined fast and slow coral predictions). A new parameter, "resource_limitation_strength", has been added to allow calibration of the strength of this effect.
   - Ecological Rationale: As coral cover declines due to predation, the limited availability of prey acts as a natural brake on COTS population growth. This modification better captures the coupled dynamics in the reef ecosystem and provides a more realistic representation of outbreak behavior.

All changes only use previous time step predictions, thus avoiding any data leakage.
