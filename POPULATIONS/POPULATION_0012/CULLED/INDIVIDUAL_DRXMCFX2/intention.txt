Assessment:
The model generally fits the boom-bust dynamics but the residuals reveal that coral losses are slightly overpredicted at high COTS densities. This suggests that assuming a constant coral predation efficiency oversimplifies the ecological interaction.

Improvement:
We introduce a variable predation efficiency decline parameter ("predation_efficiency_decline") to modulate the effective predation rate. Ecologically, at high COTS densities, interference and satiation can reduce the per capita predation efficiency. This adjustment refines the model to better capture outbreak initiation, magnitude, and duration.
