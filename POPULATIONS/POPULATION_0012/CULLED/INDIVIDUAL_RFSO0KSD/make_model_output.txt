Below is our plan: We introduce a new parameter, coral_recovery_inhibition_exponent, to allow a non‐linear scaling of the inhibition of coral recovery by high COTS densities. Ecologically, when COTS numbers are very high the negative impact on coral recovery may be disproportionately stronger (a threshold effect). We document the reasoning in intention.txt, add the new    
parameter in parameters.json with justification, and update the coral recovery equations in model.cpp to use a power function (rather than a linear term) for inhibition.

 The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations and their impacts on coral communities; however, the current linear inhibition of coral recovery by COTS density may oversimplify the ecological interactions. In reality, when COTS densities become very high, their negative impact on coral recovery could be disproportionately strong (a threshold or     
 non-linear feedback effect).

 Introduce a new parameter, "coral_recovery_inhibition_exponent", to modulate the inhibition term non-linearly. With values > 1, this parameter amplifies the suppressive effect of COTS on coral recovery, capturing severe declines in coral health during outbreaks.

 Non-linear responses are common in ecological systems and can help the model better predict sharp transitions seen in outbreak events. This improvement enhances the model’s ability to capture the ecological feedback mechanisms that determine recovery rates of coral communities.
