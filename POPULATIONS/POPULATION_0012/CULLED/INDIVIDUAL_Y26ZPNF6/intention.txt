Assessment:
The current model fits the data moderately well but the outbreak trigger function appears too rigid. Residuals indicate systematic discrepancies during outbreak onset. To better capture the abrupt, non-linear transition into outbreak phases, we have introduced a quadratic (higher-order) term into the outbreak trigger. This additional parameter, "outbreak_nonlinearity", allows the outbreak trigger to respond more sharply around the threshold (when COTS density is around 50% of carrying capacity). Ecologically, this reflects the possibility that once the COTS population nears a critical level, small increases can lead to disproportionately large outbreak effects.
