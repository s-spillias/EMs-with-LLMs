Below is our proposed update. In short, after diagnosing that the current outbreak trigger (which is a simple logistic transformation of the relative COTS density) may be too rigid to capture the observed abrupt    
transitions, we now introduce a quadratic term to allow a higher‐order nonlinearity. This change improves the flexibility of the outbreak trigger mechanism so that the model can better replicate the sudden onset and
rapid escalation of outbreak events as suggested by the residuals. This new parameter “outbreak_nonlinearity” is added to parameters.json with an ecological justification—it captures possible amplified effects in   
the outbreak threshold beyond a simple linear response. We also update intention.txt to document our assessment and reasoning.

 The current model fits the data moderately well but the outbreak trigger function appears too rigid. Residuals indicate systematic discrepancies during outbreak onset. To better capture the abrupt, non-linear      
 transition into outbreak phases, we have introduced a quadratic (higher-order) term into the outbreak trigger. This additional parameter, "outbreak_nonlinearity", allows the outbreak trigger to respond more sharpl 
 around the threshold (when COTS density is around 50% of carrying capacity). Ecologically, this reflects the possibility that once the COTS population nears a critical level, small increases can lead to            
 disproportionately large outbreak effects.

You can now proceed with these changes. To test the updated model run your simulation as usual (e.g., with your TMB-based fitting tool).
