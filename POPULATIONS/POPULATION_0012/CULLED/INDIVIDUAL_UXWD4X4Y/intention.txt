Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
1. The current model effectively captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and the selective predation on coral communities. However, the resource limitation mechanism is implemented using a standard Michaelisâ€“Menten function, which may oversimplify the non-linear effects of coral availability on COTS growth.
2. To better reflect ecological processes and threshold responses, a higher-order saturating function is introduced by raising the coral availability term to a new exponent (resource_availability_exponent). This modification enables more sensitive responses to changes in coral cover, particularly under conditions of scarcity or abundance.
3. This improvement is implemented without using current time step observations, ensuring predictions rely solely on previous state values, and provides a flexible framework for tuning the resource limitation dynamics based on empirical data.
