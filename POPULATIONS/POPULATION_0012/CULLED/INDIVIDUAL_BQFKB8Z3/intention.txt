Assessment:
The current model adequately captures the boom-bust dynamics through nonlinear outbreak triggers and resource limitation. However, a key ecological factor appears to be missing: the impact of environmental variability on predation efficiency. Variable environmental conditions (e.g. water quality, coral health) likely affect how effectively COTS prey upon corals. To address this, we introduce a new parameter `predation_env_mod` that scales the predation efficiency term in both fast- and slow-growing coral dynamics. This addition should help capture fluctuations in actual predation pressure and improve model fit.
