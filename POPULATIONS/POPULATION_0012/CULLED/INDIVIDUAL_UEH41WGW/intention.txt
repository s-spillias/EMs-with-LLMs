Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model captures the seasonal outbreak dynamics reasonably well but uses a linear modifier (i.e. "1 + coral_effect_on_outbreak * coral_availability") for the outbreak trigger. This linear approach may oversimplify the feedback between coral availability and outbreak initiation.
To better represent the ecological dynamics, we now introduce a new parameter "coral_effect_exponent" to allow a non-linear scaling of coral availability's influence on triggering outbreaks. Values > 1 will amplify the influence when coral cover is high, leading to a sharper outbreak onset, while low coral cover will produce a subdued effect. This improvement is intended to more accurately capture the threshold-like behavior observed in natural COTS epidemics.
