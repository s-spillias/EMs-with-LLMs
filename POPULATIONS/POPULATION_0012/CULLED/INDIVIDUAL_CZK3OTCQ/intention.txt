Assessment and Improvement Justification:
------------------------------------------------
1. Current assessment: The model fits the data reasonably well for non-outbreak periods but underestimates the sharp escalation during outbreaks.
2. The outbreak trigger is modeled with a sigmoid function based solely on a power-law term of the previous COTS population. However, ecological feedbacks at high COTS densities suggest a more pronounced nonlinear (quadratic) escalation may better capture outbreak magnitude.
3. Chosen Improvement: Introduce an additional quadratic correction parameter (outbreak_correction) to the outbreak trigger function. This term will account for the rapid, nonlinear amplification in outbreaks observed in nature. The correction improves the timing and magnitude prediction of outbreaks while remaining consistent with the requirement to use only previous time step predictions.
