Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model reasonably fits the outbreak cycles but does not account for the ecological phenomenon of the Allee effect,
where low densities of COTS may suffer reduced reproductive success. Incorporating an Allee effect in the logistic growth
component captures the need for a minimum density for population propagation. This improvement adds an ecological realism
to the model by modifying the growth rate at low densities while maintaining the overall dynamics of outbreak (boom-bust)
cycles.
