Assessment:
The residuals indicate that while the outbreak timing is reasonable, the magnitude and decline phases show systematic deviations. The current logistic formulation may oversimplify resource limitations, missing non-linear density-dependent effects.

Improvement:
We introduce a new density-dependent term in the COTS growth equation. The term (density_dependence) penalizes growth at high densities, representing resource limitations and heightened competition. This modification is expected to improve the modelâ€™s ability to reproduce both the explosive outbreak and subsequent bust dynamics.

Note: All predictions use only previous time step values.
