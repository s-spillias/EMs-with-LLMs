Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model uses a simple linear recovery term for both fast- and slow-growing corals, which may oversimplify the resource limitation dynamics. Ecologically, as coral cover increases, intraspecific competition (e.g., for space and nutrients) can limit recovery, leading to a saturating effect. To capture this, we introduce a new parameter, "coral_competition", that reduces the effective recovery rate as the total coral cover increases. This adjustment better represents the boom-bust cycles under high coral densities and prevents unrealistically rapid recovery.
