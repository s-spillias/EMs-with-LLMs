Assessment and Reasoning:
1. The current model employs a linear decline for COTS outbreaks, which may not capture the abrupt collapses observed in boom-bust cycles.
2. A nonlinear decline mechanism is more ecologically realistic since intense density-dependent effects can trigger rapid population declines during outbreaks.
3. To address this, we introduce a new parameter, `outbreak_decline_exponent`. When set above 1, it amplifies the decline rate for high COTS densities.
4. This improvement better aligns the model's mechanism with ecological processes such as intraspecific competition and abrupt resource depletion.
