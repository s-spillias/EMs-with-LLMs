Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
Our evaluation indicates that while the current model reasonably captures the outbreak dynamics of COTS and includes resource limitation by coral cover, the linear inhibition on coral recovery may be oversimplified. In natural systems, high COTS densities can trigger cascade effects that suppress coral recovery in a nonlinear, threshold-like manner. To address this, we propose modifying the recovery equations by replacing the linear inhibition term with an exponential decay function.
This change introduces a new parameter, "coral_recovery_inhibition_exponent", that modulates how strongly COTS density suppresses coral recovery. Higher values will capture a sharper decline in coral recovery at high COTS densities, aligning the model more closely with observed boom-bust dynamics and the ecological processes of impaired coral resilience.
