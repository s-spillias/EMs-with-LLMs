Assessment and Improvement:
- The current model robustly captures the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth and a smooth outbreak trigger.
- However, the constant predation efficiency (coral_predation_efficiency) oversimplifies the ecological dynamics.
- In reality, predation on coral often exhibits saturation as coral cover increases due to handling time limitations.
- To better capture these dynamics, we introduce a new parameter "handling_time" which modulates a Holling Type II functional response.
- This improvement provides a more realistic, non-linear representation of coral predation dynamics during outbreaks.
