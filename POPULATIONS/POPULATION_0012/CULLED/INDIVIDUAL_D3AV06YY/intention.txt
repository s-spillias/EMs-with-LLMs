Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures the boom‐bust dynamics by incorporating logistic growth, resource limitation, and an outbreak trigger based on a logistic function. However, residual patterns suggest that the outbreak trigger is too gradual compared to the rapid transitions observed in the data.
Improvement:
To better represent the abrupt outbreak onset observed in nature, a cubic term is introduced into the outbreak trigger function. This term is ecologically justified as it captures the high‐order density dependent feedbacks that accelerate outbreak initiation when COTS densities are high.
