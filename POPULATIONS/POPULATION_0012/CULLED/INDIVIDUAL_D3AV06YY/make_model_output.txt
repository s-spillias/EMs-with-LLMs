Below is our proposal. In summary, the assessment determined that although the current model generally captures the boom‐bust dynamics,
the outbreak trigger formulation may be too gradual. To better capture the abrupt initiation of COTS outbreaks—likely due to complex   
density‐dependent feedbacks—we introduce a cubic term into the outbreak trigger. Ecologically, this new term allows the model to       
represent accelerating outbreak onset at high population densities. We document this rationale in intention.txt and add a new parameter
with clear justification in parameters.json. Finally, model.cpp is updated to declare the new parameter and include the cubic term in  
the outbreak trigger calculation.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 The current model reasonably captures the boom‐bust dynamics by incorporating logistic growth, resource limitation, and an outbreak   
 trigger based on a logistic function. However, residual patterns suggest that the outbreak trigger is too gradual compared to the rap 
 transitions observed in the data.                                                                                                     
 Improvement:                                                                                                                          
 To better represent the abrupt outbreak onset observed in nature, a cubic term is introduced into the outbreak trigger function. This 
 term is ecologically justified as it captures the high‐order density dependent feedbacks that accelerate outbreak initiation when COT 
 densities are high.
