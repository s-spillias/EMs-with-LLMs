Assessment:
The current model captures outbreak dynamics but underpredicts the rapid escalation observed during outbreak onset. Introducing a quadratic amplification via the new parameter "outbreak_nonlinearity" allows the outbreak trigger to respond more sharply once COTS populations exceed a critical threshold. This change is ecologically justified as it better captures the abrupt transition in outbreak events, thereby enhancing the model's ability to predict timing, magnitude, and duration of boom-bust cycles.
