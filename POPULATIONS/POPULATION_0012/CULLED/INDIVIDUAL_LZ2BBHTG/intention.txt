Assessment and Model Refinement:
The current model captures COTS growth and outbreak dynamics but oversimplifies the bust phase by not incorporating a feedback from coral cover.
Ecologically, when coral cover is low, COTS populations may collapse faster due to reduced food/habitat.
We introduce the "coral_dependent_decay_factor" to modulate the outbreak decline rate, enabling a more rapid decay when coral cover is scarce.
This adjustment should better capture the characteristic boom‚Äêbust cycles observed in the data.
