Below are the changes I propose:                                                                                                       

Summary and rationale:                                                                                                                 
The current model does a good job capturing basic boom‐bust dynamics but does not account for delayed feedback in outbreak initiation. 
Empirical evidence suggests that a rapid population increase can “prime” the system, enhancing the outbreak trigger beyond the         
instantaneous value. To capture this, we add a new parameter, outbreak_memory, and use it to scale the outbreak trigger (via           
effective_sharpness) based on the difference between recent COTS predictions. This change adds realism by modelling system inertia     
without introducing data leakage (only previous time steps are used).

    Assessment: The current model captures basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks; however, it oversimplifies delayed feedback     
    mechanisms. Rapid increases in COTS numbers can create momentum, priming the outbreak trigger beyond what is captured by the curre 
    hysteresis term.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                       
    Improvement: We introduce a new parameter "outbreak_memory" to incorporate this delayed feedback. The model now scales the outbrea 
    trigger based on the difference between the most recent COTS population values, thereby capturing the inertia in the system. This  
    ecological improvement is justified by observations that sudden population surges induce a stronger outbreak response.

After applying these changes, you can recompile/run the model to check whether the new delayed feedback mechanism improves the model   
fit to the data.

Below are the changes I propose:

**Summary and rationale:**  
The current model does a good job capturing basic boom‐bust dynamics but does not account for delayed feedback in outbreak initiation. 
Empirical evidence suggests that a rapid population increase can “prime” the system, enhancing the outbreak trigger beyond the 
instantaneous value. To capture this, we add a new parameter, `outbreak_memory`, and use it to scale the outbreak trigger (via 
effective_sharpness) based on the difference between recent COTS predictions. This change adds realism by modelling system inertia 
without introducing data leakage (only previous time steps are used).

 Assessment: The current model captures basic boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks; however, it oversimplifies delayed feedback. Rapid 
 increases in COTS populations can “prime” the outbreak trigger, implying inertia in system response.                                  
                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement: We introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_memory", to incorporate this delayed feedback. In the model, effective_sharpness 
 is scaled based on the difference between consecutive COTS predictions (using only previous time step values) to avoid data leakage.  
 This adds ecological realism by capturing the system inertia observed in episodic outbreaks.
