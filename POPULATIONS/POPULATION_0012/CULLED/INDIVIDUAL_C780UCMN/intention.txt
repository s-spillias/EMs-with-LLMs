Assessment: The current model captures basic boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks; however, it oversimplifies delayed feedback. Rapid increases in COTS populations can “prime” the outbreak trigger, implying inertia in system response.

Improvement: We introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_memory", to incorporate this delayed feedback. In the model, effective_sharpness is scaled based on the difference between consecutive COTS predictions (using only previous time step values) to avoid data leakage. This adds ecological realism by capturing the system inertia observed in episodic outbreaks.
