Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model captures boom‚Äêbust dynamics of COTS outbreaks with several ecological processes, but the outbreak trigger relies solely on COTS density.
2. In reality, the relative abundance of fast-growing coral (preferred by COTS) can further sensitize outbreak initiation.
3. To better capture the timing and magnitude of outbreaks, we introduce a new parameter ("fast_coral_modifier") so that when fast coral cover is high relative to slow-growing coral, the outbreak trigger becomes more sensitive.
4. This added mechanism provides a realistic indirect feedback without introducing data leakage, as only previous time-step predictions are used.
