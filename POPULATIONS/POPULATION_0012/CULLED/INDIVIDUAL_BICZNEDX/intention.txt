Assessment:
1. The current model uses logistic growth combined with a smooth outbreak-triggered decline function to capture outbreak dynamics. However, it does not explicitly account for the indirect ecological feedback whereby severe coral depletion may limit COTS growth via food limitation.
2. In the context of modeling episodic outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef, it is ecologically important that the model reflects that low coral availability (prey) can suppress prolonged COTS outbreaks.
3. The chosen improvement is to incorporate a coral availability feedback mechanism into the COTS growth equation. The total predicted coral cover (fast + slow) is normalized by an assumed maximum (200%), and the growth rate is modulated by a factor (1 + coral_limitation_feedback * (normalized coral - 0.5)). This implies that when coral cover is low (<50% normalized), the COTS growth is reduced, capturing starvation effects.
4. A new parameter `coral_limitation_feedback` is added to allow tuning of this feedback strength.
