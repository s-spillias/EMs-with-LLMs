Assessment:
After evaluating the model, it appears that while the logistic growth and outbreak-trigger formulations are reasonable, the recovery dynamics of fast-growing corals appear oversimplified. Residual patterns suggest that coral recovery accelerates non-linearly when coral cover is far below 100%. To capture this, a quadratic term is introduced into the recovery component for fast-growing corals. The new parameter "fast_recovery_curvature" modulates this curvature, representing thresholds in recruitment dynamics. This ecological improvement better reflects the non-linear feedback expected in coral regeneration dynamics.
