 1 Assessment and ecologically motivated reasoning (for intention.txt):                                                                                                                                                
   We assess that the current model captures outbreak dynamics using linear recovery for fast-growing coral—which may oversimplify recovery processes. Observed residuals indicate that recovery may accelerate        
   non‐linearly once coral cover is moderately reduced. To address this, we propose adding a quadratic term (via a new parameter "fast_recovery_curvature") to the fast-growing coral recovery. This change captures   
   the intuition that when coral cover is far from saturation (i.e. far below 100%), the recovery rate increases more than linearly, reflecting recruitment thresholds. Also, note that the modification uses only     
   previous time step values to prevent data leakage.                                                                                                                                                                  
 2 Parameter Addition in parameters.json:                                                                                                                                                                              
   We add the parameter "fast_recovery_curvature" with a suggested initial value (e.g., 0.01) along with documentation.

   In the fast-growing coral dynamics equation, add a quadratic term to the recovery component:

 After evaluating the model, it appears that while the logistic growth and outbreak-trigger formulations are reasonable, the recovery dynamics of fast-growing corals appear oversimplified. Residual patterns suggest 
 that coral recovery accelerates non-linearly when coral cover is far below 100%. To capture this, a quadratic term is introduced into the recovery component for fast-growing corals. The new parameter               
 "fast_recovery_curvature" modulates this curvature, representing thresholds in recruitment dynamics. This ecological improvement better reflects the non-linear feedback expected in coral regeneration dynamics.
