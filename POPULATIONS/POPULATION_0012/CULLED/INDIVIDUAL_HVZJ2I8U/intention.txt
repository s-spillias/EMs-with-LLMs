Assessment and Ecological Reasoning:
-------------------------------------
The current model captures the boom‚Äêbust cycle of COTS reasonably well, but the outbreak initiation mechanism is oversimplified. The outbreak trigger is modeled by a standard sigmoid function that may not fully reflect the abrupt ecological threshold observed in empirical data, where COTS populations rapidly shift into outbreak mode after a critical tipping point is reached.

Proposed Improvement:
---------------------
Introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_trigger_exponent", to control the non-linearity of the outbreak trigger. By raising the difference (between the previous step COTS population and the outbreak threshold) to this exponent, the model can produce a sharper transition when the population exceeds the threshold, mimicking a tipping point. This added flexibility is ecologically justified as many marine predator-prey dynamics exhibit a rapid change in response following a critical threshold, thereby better capturing the timing and magnitude of outbreak events.

Changes:
1. Added "outbreak_trigger_exponent" to parameters.json with a default value of 2.0.
2. Updated model.cpp to include this parameter in the outbreak trigger calculation, ensuring only the previous time step values are used in predictions.
