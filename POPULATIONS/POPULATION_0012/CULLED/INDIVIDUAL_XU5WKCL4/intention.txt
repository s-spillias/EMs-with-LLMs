Assessment and Improvement:
---------------------------
The current model captures the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks reasonably well; however, residuals indicate that when coral cover is high, the observed decline in coral cover is more pronounced than predicted. This suggests that the predation effect of COTS on coral may be oversimplified.
To address this, a new quadratic term is introduced in the coral predation component, which allows predation efficiency to increase non‚Äêlinearly with coral cover. This represents the ecological scenario where increased coral availability accelerates the feeding rate of COTS, consistent with empirical observations of outbreak dynamics.
