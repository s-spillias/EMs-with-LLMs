[Documenting assessment and model improvement]
Current assessment:
- The model adequately captures the boom-bust cycle of COTS with logistic growth and outbreak-triggered decline.
- Residuals analysis indicates systematic discrepancies during outbreak peaks, suggesting that the representation of predation efficiency is oversimplified.
- In particular, the fixed handling time may not capture predator satiation effects when coral cover is very high.

Chosen improvement:
- Introduce a dynamic handling time modifier to adjust the effective handling time based on coral abundance.
- Ecological rationale: As coral cover increases, a higher handling time (due to predator satiation) may reduce predation efficiency. This non-linear effect is more realistic in representing feeding dynamics.
