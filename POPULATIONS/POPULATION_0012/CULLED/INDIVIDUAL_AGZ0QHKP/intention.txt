Project Assessment:
1. The current model fits outbreak data moderately well, yet residuals indicate an underestimation of non-linear predation effects.
2. In the current formulation, coral predation is modeled with a Holling Type II response. However, low coral cover typically leads to significantly reduced predation efficiency, with a subsequent sigmoidal increase as cover rises.
3. Chosen Improvement: Transition to a Holling Type III (sigmoidal) functional response for coral predation.
   - Ecological Rationale: This approach captures how predators may have difficulty locating scarce prey at low coral cover, then rapidly increase efficiency before saturating at high cover, thereby better modeling outbreak dynamics.
