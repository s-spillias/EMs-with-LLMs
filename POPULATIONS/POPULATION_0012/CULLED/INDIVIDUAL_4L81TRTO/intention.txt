Project Assessment and Improvement Notes:
The residual analysis indicated a systematic bias in the timing of outbreak initiation. The previous model used a fixed outbreak threshold (0.5 * carrying_capacity) that oversimplified the real-world dynamics of COTS outbreaks. 
To enhance ecological realism, we have introduced a new parameter, outbreak_threshold, that adjusts the triggering level for outbreak declines. This parameter captures the variability in outbreak onset stemming from environmental factors and intraspecific interactions, leading to improved predictions of outbreak magnitude and duration.
