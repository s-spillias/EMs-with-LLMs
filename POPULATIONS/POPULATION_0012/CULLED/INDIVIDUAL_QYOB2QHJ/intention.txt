Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
--------------------------------------
1. Evaluation of the current model indicates that while the logistic growth, resource limitation, and outbreak-trigger dynamics capture the characteristic boom‚Äêbust cycles of COTS, the transition out of outbreak phases may be too abrupt. 
2. The project context emphasizes accurately capturing outbreak timing and duration. An ecological mechanism such as hysteresis, where recovery from an outbreak is delayed due to ecological inertia, could improve the model.
3. We introduce a hysteresis_factor to adjust the effective outbreak threshold when COTS populations are falling. This added complexity is justified by ecological research showing delayed reset of ecosystem states.
   
Chosen Improvement:
- Incorporate a hysteresis mechanism in the outbreak trigger calculation. When the previous population is below the nominal threshold, the threshold is effectively raised (multiplied by hysteresis_factor), thereby delaying outbreak deactivation.

This change is expected to better capture the lagged response in natural systems, leading to improved predictions of outbreak duration and magnitude.
