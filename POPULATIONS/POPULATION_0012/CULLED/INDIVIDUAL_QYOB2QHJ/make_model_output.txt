Below are the proposed changes. I've chosen to introduce a hysteresis mechanism to improve the timing of outbreak deactivation: once an
outbreak is triggered, a new "hysteresis_factor" (values >1) delays reverting to a non‐outbreak state. This amendment helps capture    
ecological inertia and adjusts the outbreak trigger based on previous COTS levels. The assessments and ecological rationale are        
documented in intention.txt, a new parameter has been added to parameters.json with justification, and model.cpp now uses the new      
parameter in the outbreak trigger logic. Please review and confirm.

 =======                                                                                                                               
 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                 
 --------------------------------------                                                                                                
 1. Evaluation of the current model indicates that while the logistic growth, resource limitation, and outbreak-trigger dynamics captu 
 the characteristic boom‐bust cycles of COTS, the transition out of outbreak phases may be too abrupt.                                 
 2. The project context emphasizes accurately capturing outbreak timing and duration. An ecological mechanism such as hysteresis, wher 
 recovery from an outbreak is delayed due to ecological inertia, could improve the model.                                              
 3. We introduce a hysteresis_factor to adjust the effective outbreak threshold when COTS populations are falling. This added complexi 
 is justified by ecological research showing delayed reset of ecosystem states.                                                        
                                                                                                                                       
 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                   
 - Incorporate a hysteresis mechanism in the outbreak trigger calculation. When the previous population is below the nominal threshold 
 the threshold is effectively raised (multiplied by hysteresis_factor), thereby delaying outbreak deactivation.                        
                                                                                                                                       
 This change is expected to better capture the lagged response in natural systems, leading to improved predictions of outbreak duratio 
 and magnitude.
