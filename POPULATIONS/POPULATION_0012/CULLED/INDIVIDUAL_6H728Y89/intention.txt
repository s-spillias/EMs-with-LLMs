Assessment:
The current model effectively captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations; however, the outbreak trigger function is solely a function of COTS density. Ecologically, the availability of coral can further promote outbreak events by enhancing resource availability.
Improvement:
Introduce a new modifier ("coral_effect_on_outbreak") to scale the outbreak trigger based on coral availability. This modification allows the outbreak sensitivity to increase when coral cover is high, aligning with ecological expectations and observed data patterns.
