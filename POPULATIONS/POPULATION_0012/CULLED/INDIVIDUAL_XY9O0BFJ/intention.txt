Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model, based on logistic growth with a sigmoid outbreak trigger, fits the data reasonably well but may oversimplify the dynamics leading to rapid COTS outbreaks. Residual analysis suggests that the outbreak onsets are not abrupt enough. To better capture the episodic and threshold-dependent nature of COTS booms observed in the Great Barrier Reef, we introduce a higher-order (quadratic) term in the outbreak trigger function. This additional nonlinearity (via a new parameter 'outbreak_aux') sharpens the outbreak onset, reflecting the strong ecological feedbacks and sudden transitions in population dynamics.
