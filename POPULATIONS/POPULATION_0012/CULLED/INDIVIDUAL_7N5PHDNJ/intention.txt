Project Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model uses a fixed outbreak trigger function based solely on COTS density (using a logistic function).
2. However, it omits an important ecological feedback: the available coral resource. In reality, coral cover directly influences whether an outbreak is sustainable.
3. To capture this, the revised model incorporates the coral cover from the previous time step (fast and slow coral cover) to adjust the threshold for outbreak initiation.
4. A new parameter, "coral_outbreak_feedback", modulates how a deficit in coral cover (relative to maximal cover of 200%) increases the effective outbreak threshold.
This improvement is ecologically justified because low coral availability (the food/resource) can delay or prevent outbreak dynamics in COTS populations.
