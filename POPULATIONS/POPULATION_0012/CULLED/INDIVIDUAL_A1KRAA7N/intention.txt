Assessment and Proposed Improvement:
The current model employs a fixed outbreak trigger with a hard-coded steepness (100) at 0.5 * carrying_capacity. While this captures basic boom-bust behavior, it oversimplifies the outbreak initiation process and does not account for environmental variability.
To better capture the episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish, we propose adding an adjustable parameter, "outbreak_steepness", to modulate the sharpness of the outbreak trigger function. This improvement allows more flexible, ecologically realistic modeling of outbreak onset and duration, aligning with the projectâ€™s focus on timing, magnitude, and duration of the outbreaks.
