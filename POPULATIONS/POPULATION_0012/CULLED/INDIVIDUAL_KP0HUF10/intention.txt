Assessment:
The current model captures the logistic outbreak dynamics of COTS and incorporates saturating predation effects on corals. However, a key ecological process is oversimplified: the dependency of COTS reproduction on the availability of coral resources. In reality, abundant coral (both fast- and slow-growing) can promote outbreak persistence, whereas depleted coral cover will limit COTS growth. To address this, we introduce a resource limitation effect via a new parameter, "coral_resource_modifier". This parameter scales the COTS growth rate according to a normalized measure of the available coral cover, computed as (fast_pred + slow_pred)/200, ensuring that only previous time step values are used.
