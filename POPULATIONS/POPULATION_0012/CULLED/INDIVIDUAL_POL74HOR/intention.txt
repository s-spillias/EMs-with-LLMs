Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures outbreak dynamics but oversimplifies resource limitation by not factoring in coral availability in COTS growth.

Chosen Improvement:
We introduce an ecological feedback mechanism by modulating the COTS logistic growth with available coral cover (sum of fast and slow predictions normalized by 200). This reflects that lower coral cover limits food availability, thereby reducing COTS growth.

Modifications:
1. Added new parameter "coral_effect" (value 0.3) in parameters.json.
2. In model.cpp, included a coral availability term: coral_effect * (fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / 200.0 used to scale the COTS growth.
3. Confirmed only previous time step prediction values are used in calculations.
