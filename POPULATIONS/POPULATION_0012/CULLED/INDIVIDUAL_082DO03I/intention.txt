Assessment:
The current model captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef. However, analysis of the residuals suggests that the linear scaling of COTS growth by coral availability oversimplifies the trophic interaction. Ecologically, additional coral does not linearly enhance COTS growth due to limitations in foraging and energy conversion—these benefits saturate at higher coral densities.
Improvement:
We replace the linear resource limitation term with a Michaelis–Menten (saturating) function. This adjustment better represents diminishing returns from coral availability and hence improves the model's ecological realism.
