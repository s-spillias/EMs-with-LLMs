Assessment:
The current model captures outbreak dynamics, resource limitations, and COTS predation reasonably well. However, the fast-growing coral (Acropora spp.) recovery is modeled using a linear function, which residuals suggest may be underestimating recovery when coral cover is low.
Improvement:
Introduce a non-linear recovery term by incorporating a new parameter "fast_recovery_exponent". By raising the recovery gap (100 - fast_pred[t-1]) to this exponent (<1), we capture the diminishing recovery rate as coral cover increases due to physiological or environmental constraints. This modification better reflects the ecological processes behind repeated COTS outbreaks and coral damage.
