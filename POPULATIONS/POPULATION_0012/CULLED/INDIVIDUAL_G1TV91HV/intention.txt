Assessment:
The current model fits the observed data moderately well; however, it underestimates the rapid, explosive nature of COTS outbreaks.
The outbreak trigger, although based on logistic behavior, does not fully capture the intense positive feedback once COTS densities exceed a threshold.
Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a higher-order, polynomial nonlinear feedback term in the growth equation through a new parameter, "outbreak_nonlinearity". This term amplifies growth when COTS densities are high relative to the carrying capacity, reflecting stronger density‚Äêdependent effects and the positive feedback observed during outbreaks.
