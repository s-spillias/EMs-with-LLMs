Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model does a reasonable job capturing boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks, but the resource limitation mechanism (which scales growth linearly with coral availability) may oversimplify the ecological reality. In many reef systems, low coral cover can have a disproportionately strong suppressing effect on COTS growth. 

To address the PROJECT CONTEXT—capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks more accurately—we introduce a non‐linear resource limitation function. By adding the parameter "resource_limitation_exponent", we allow the model to amplify the suppression effect when coral resources are scarce (values > 1). This additional non-linearity better represents threshold dynamics in resource competition and improves outbreak predictions.
