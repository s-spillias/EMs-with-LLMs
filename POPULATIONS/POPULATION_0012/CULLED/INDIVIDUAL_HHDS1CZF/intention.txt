Assessment:
-----------
The residuals indicate that while the current model captures the general boom‚Äêbust cycles of COTS and the associated coral predation, discrepancies remain during the initiation of outbreaks. Ecologically, coral cover plays a key role in providing habitat complexity and influencing larval survival; thus, prey abundance can feed back into outbreak dynamics.

Chosen Improvement:
-------------------
We introduce a new parameter, "coral_effect", to incorporate the influence of average coral cover (combining fast-growing and slow-growing corals) into the outbreak trigger. The modified outbreak trigger now accounts not only for the COTS density relative to carrying capacity but also for the degree to which coral cover deviates from its optimal level (taken here as 50%). This addition represents a resource limitation mechanism and extra ecological feedback, capturing the indirect effect of coral availability on outbreak initiation.

Changes:
- Added new parameter "coral_effect" in parameters.json with clear ecological justification.
- Modified outbreak trigger in model.cpp to include the effect of average coral cover.
