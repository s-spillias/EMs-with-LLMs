Assessment and Rationale:
The current model successfully captures the boomâ€“bust cycles of COTS outbreaks and their predation on coral communities. However, an evaluation of the residuals indicates a systematic under-prediction of recovery when coral cover is very low. Ecologically, this can be understood as an Allee effect in coral recovery: when coral populations fall below a certain threshold, recruitment and recovery are disproportionately inhibited due to lowered reproductive capacity or limited larval supply.
To address this, the recovery equations for both fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites have been modified by incorporating a non-linear factor:
    (coral_pred[t-1] / (coral_pred[t-1] + coral_allee_threshold))
This factor ensures that recovery is reduced when coral cover is very low.
A new parameter, `coral_allee_threshold`, has been added to define this threshold.
