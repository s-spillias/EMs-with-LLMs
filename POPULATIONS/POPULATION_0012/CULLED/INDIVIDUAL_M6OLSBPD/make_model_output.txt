Below is our plan to make one meaningful ecological improvement. In our assessment we noted that the current model—with its fixed      
recovery rate form for coral—may not fully capture the low-coral cover dynamics observed in the residuals. In many reef systems, very  
low coral cover can delay recovery further due to an Allee effect (reduced recruitment when coral density is very low). To address     
this, we will modify the recovery terms for both fast‐ and slow‐growing corals so that recovery slows when coral cover is low. In      
practice, we multiply the "gap" term by a factor of                                                                                    
  (coral_pred[t-1] / (coral_pred[t-1] + coral_allee_threshold))                                                                        
which reduces the recovery rate when the current cover is small. We also add a new parameter, coral_allee_threshold, to the model with 
an ecologically motivated value.                                                                                                       

Below are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the three files that we will update:                                                           

 1 Update intention.txt with our assessment and reasoning.                                                                             
 2 Update parameters.json by adding the new parameter entry.                                                                           
 3 Update model.cpp to implement the modified coral recovery terms for fast- and slow-growing corals.

 Assessment and Rationale:                                                                                                             
 The current model successfully captures the boom–bust cycles of COTS outbreaks and their predation on coral communities. However, an  
 evaluation of the residuals indicates a systematic under-prediction of recovery when coral cover is very low. Ecologically, this can  
 understood as an Allee effect in coral recovery: when coral populations fall below a certain threshold, recruitment and recovery are  
 disproportionately inhibited due to lowered reproductive capacity or limited larval supply.                                           
 To address this, the recovery equations for both fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites have been modified by        
 incorporating a non-linear factor:                                                                                                    
     (coral_pred[t-1] / (coral_pred[t-1] + coral_allee_threshold))                                                                     
 This factor ensures that recovery is reduced when coral cover is very low.                                                            
 A new parameter, `coral_allee_threshold`, has been added to define this threshold.

After applying these changes, you may compile and run the model to check whether the modified recovery dynamics better capture the     
observed coral recovery patterns under low cover conditions.
