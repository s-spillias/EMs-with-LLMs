Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures outbreak dynamics of COTS, but residual analysis indicates that interactions between the two coral groups may be oversimplified.
In natural reef systems, fast‐ and slow–growing corals compete for limited space. To incorporate this resource limitation, we introduce a competition coefficient that reduces the effective recovery
of each coral group by the cover of the other. This adjustment helps simulate realistic interspecific competition while ensuring no data leakage by using only previous time step values.
