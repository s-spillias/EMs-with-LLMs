Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model fits data reasonably well with logistic growth and a smooth outbreak-triggered decline based solely on COTS density relative to carrying capacity. However, residuals suggest that the model underestimates the rapid decline (bust phase) following outbreaks. This improvement introduces an additional density-dependent competition term via the new parameter "competition_coef". 
Ecological Justification:
At high densities, COTS individuals likely experience heightened intraspecific competition for limited resources and prey, which accelerates population decline. This additional term captures resource limitations beyond the logistic constraint, aligning with field observations of sharper post-outbreak declines. 
Thus, the modification more accurately reflects the boom-bust cycles observed in outbreak dynamics.
