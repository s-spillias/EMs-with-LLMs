Assessment:
After evaluating the model and its residuals, we find that while the current formulation captures boom‐bust dynamics, the outbreak trigger relies solely on COTS density relative to carrying capacity. Ecologically, abundant coral (prey) can fuel outbreak intensity. 

Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter "coral_outbreak_sensitivity" to nonlinearly modulate the outbreak trigger with coral availability. Within the model, the outbreak trigger is now multiplied by a Hill-type function based on the sum of fast- and slow-growing coral cover. This change links outbreak initiation to food abundance, improving the ecological realism of the predator–prey dynamics.
