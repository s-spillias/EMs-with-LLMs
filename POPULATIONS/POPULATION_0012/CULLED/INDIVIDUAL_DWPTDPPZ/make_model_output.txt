Assessment and Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
An analysis of the current model shows that while it reproduces boom‐bust cycles with a logistic growth and an outbreak trigger driven solely by COTS density (relative to carrying capacity), it neglects that outbreak initiation may be strongly influenced by prey (coral) availability. Ecologically, outbreaks are more likely and more intense when coral cover is high because 
abundant food can increase aggregation and foraging efficiency. To capture this, we add a new parameter, coral_outbreak_sensitivity, that modulates the outbreak trigger by incorporating the previous time step’s total coral cover (the sum of fast_pred and slow_pred) via a Hill‐type function. This non‐linear modification links outbreak initiation to coral availability and   
more realistically reflects the predator–prey dynamics.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 After evaluating the model and its residuals, we find that while the current formulation captures boom‐bust dynamics, the outbreak    
 trigger relies solely on COTS density relative to carrying capacity. Ecologically, abundant coral (prey) can fuel outbreak intensity.

 We introduce a new parameter "coral_outbreak_sensitivity" to nonlinearly modulate the outbreak trigger with coral availability. Withi 
 the model, the outbreak trigger is now multiplied by a Hill-type function based on the sum of fast- and slow-growing coral cover. Thi 
 change links outbreak initiation to food abundance, improving the ecological realism of the predator–prey dynamics.
