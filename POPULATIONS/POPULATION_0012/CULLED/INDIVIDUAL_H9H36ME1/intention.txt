Assessment and Improvement:
--------------------------------
1. Model Fit & Context: The current model captures key boom‐bust dynamics and coral predation effects but shows residuals indicating that the resource limitation mechanism could be improved.
2. Ecological Rationale: As coral cover increases, its contribution to resources for COTS growth may not scale linearly but rather exhibit diminishing returns due to spatial constraints and competition among corals.
3. Chosen Improvement: Introduce a quadratic saturating term in the resource limitation function. We add a new parameter "coral_saturation_coefficient" to modulate this non-linear effect.
4. Expected Impact: This change enhances model realism by better capturing the non‐linear relationship between coral availability and COTS growth, thereby improving predictions of outbreak timing and magnitude.
