Assessment and Reasoning:
---------------------------
1. Model Fit: Residuals suggest that the logistic outbreak trigger may delay or misrepresent the onset of COTS outbreaks.
2. Ecological Process: The logistic function oversimplifies the transition between non-outbreak and outbreak states. A smoother mechanism is needed to capture the rapid onset and decline dynamics.
3. Chosen Improvement: Replace the logistic outbreak trigger with a hyperbolic tangent formulation. The new formulation,
   Type outbreak_trigger = 0.5 * (Type(1) + tanh(outbreak_sharpness * environmental_modifier * (cots_pred[t-1] - outbreak_threshold * carrying_capacity)));
   provides a symmetric, smooth transition around the threshold and better reflects the system dynamics without using current time step observational data.
