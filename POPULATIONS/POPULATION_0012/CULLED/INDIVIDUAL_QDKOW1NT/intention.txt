Assessment and Improvement:

The current model captures the cyclic outbreak dynamics of COTS and coral interactions using logistic growth modified by a sigmoidal outbreak trigger, and resource-limited growth based on coral availability. However, it lacks an explicit density-dependent mortality mechanism. In natural systems, high COTS densities may lead to increased intraspecific competition and higher disease transmission, resulting in additional mortality. 

Improvement Choice:
To better reflect these ecological feedbacks and avoid unrealistically high outbreak sizes, we introduce a new parameter "density_mortality". This term subtracts a mortality component proportional to the square of the COTS population (i.e. density_mortality * population^2) during each time step. This adjustment captures self-limiting dynamics that are significant during outbreak phases.
