Below is our proposed improvement. We assessed that while the existing model uses a sigmoidal outbreak‐trigger to modulate COTS decline, it does not include an additional mechanism capturing increased mortality from intraspecific competition or potential diseases when COTS densities are high. Such density‐dependent mortality is ecologically well supported and can help     
prevent unrealistic outbreak sizes. Thus, we add a new parameter, density_mortality, and subtract a quadratic mortality term from the COTS update. We also document our assessment and reasoning in intention.txt.

 The current model captures the cyclic outbreak dynamics of COTS and coral interactions using logistic growth modified by a sigmoidal outbreak trigger, and resource-limited growth based on coral availability. However, it lacks an explicit density-dependent mortality mechanism. In natural systems, high COTS densities may lead to increased intraspecific competition and high 
 disease transmission, resulting in additional mortality.

 To better reflect these ecological feedbacks and avoid unrealistically high outbreak sizes, we introduce a new parameter "density_mortality". This term subtracts a mortality component proportional to the square of the COTS population (i.e. density_mortality * population^2) during each time step. This adjustment captures self-limiting dynamics that are significant during  
 outbreak phases.
