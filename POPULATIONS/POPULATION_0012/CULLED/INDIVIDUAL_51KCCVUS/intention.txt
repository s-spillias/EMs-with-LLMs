Project Context:
The current model applies logistic growth with a smooth outbreak trigger when COTS numbers exceed 50% of the carrying capacity.
Residual analysis suggests that while boom‐bust cycles are generally captured, the timing and magnitude of outbreaks are not fully aligned with observed dynamics.
Additionally, the model does not incorporate an indirect feedback mechanism from coral cover that could delay or advance outbreak onset.
We propose adding a feedback mechanism by introducing a new parameter "coral_feedback_factor" that modifies the effective outbreak threshold based on the average coral cover (fast and slow coral predictions). 
When coral cover is high relative to its maximum, the effective threshold is reduced—making outbreaks more likely—while lower coral cover raises the threshold.
This approach refines the outbreak trigger, aligning the model’s dynamics more closely with the complex ecological interactions underlying COTS outbreaks.
