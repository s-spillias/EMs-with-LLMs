Assessment:
- The current model captures boom-bust cycles and incorporates a non-linear outbreak trigger.
- However, the outbreak trigger is based solely on the previous time step's COTS prediction, which may oversimplify the delayed ecological feedback seen in real systems.
- Residuals indicate that outbreak timing and duration could be improved by incorporating a memory effect.

Improvement:
- A new parameter "outbreak_memory" is introduced to blend the instantaneous outbreak trigger (computed from cots_pred[t-1]) with its previous value.
- This temporal smoothing captures inertia in the outbreak dynamics, reflecting that outbreaks may persist or decline gradually due to ecological delays.
