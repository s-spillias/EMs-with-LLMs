Assessment and Improvement Notes:
1. The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS and its predation on corals, but uses a linear approach for incorporating coral availability (resource limitation) into COTS growth.
2. Residuals suggest that the linear modulation of resource availability may be oversimplified. In real-world dynamics, the benefit of coral cover to COTS growth likely saturates at higher values.
3. To better capture the ecological process, we introduce a non‑linear saturating function—using a Michaelis–Menten form—with a new parameter “k_resource”. This parameter serves as the half‑saturation constant for the effect of coral availability on COTS growth.
4. This change helps model outbreak timing and magnitude more realistically by limiting the growth boost from coral availability when it is abundant.
