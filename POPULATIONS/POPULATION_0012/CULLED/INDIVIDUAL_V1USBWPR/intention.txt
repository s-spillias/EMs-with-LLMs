The assessment: The current model reasonably fits the observed trends but oversimplifies resource limitations by assuming a constant carrying capacity for COTS. Since COTS rely on coral as a primary food source, low coral cover should restrict their growth. To capture this ecological feedback, we introduce a dynamic carrying capacity where the effective carrying capacity is scaled by the previous time step's total coral cover. A new parameter, min_carrying_capacity_fraction (default value 0.5), represents the minimum fraction of carrying capacity available when coral cover is absent. This modification adds realism by linking coral availability directly to COTS outbreak magnitude.
