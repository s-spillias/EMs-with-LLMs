Assessment:
The current model simulates episodic COTS outbreaks using logistic growth and an outbreak trigger based solely on the most recent predicted density. However, residual analysis suggests that the timing and magnitude of outbreaks may not capture the delayed density-dependent effects commonly seen in ecological systems.

Chosen Improvement:
Incorporate a moving average of the COTS predicted population (using the previous two time steps) in the outbreak trigger calculation. This change introduces memory into the system, which helps smooth out short-term fluctuations and reflects ecological inertia in outbreak dynamics.
