Below is our plan and proposed changes:                                                                                                                                                                                

Assessment & Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                              
Based on the residuals and model context, the primary issue appears to be that coral recovery is currently modeled as a simple linear function proportional to the gap to full cover. Ecologically, recovery           
(recruitment and growth) may be density‐dependent—not only increasing as cover decreases but also slowing when cover is very low because of Allee Effects (e.g., limited reproduction, less larval supply) and         
potentially saturating at intermediate levels. To capture this non‐linear response, we modify the recovery term for both fast- and slow-growing corals by introducing a multiplicative term (current cover / 100) that 
peaks at intermediate cover levels.                                                                                                                                                                                    

Changes to be made:                                                                                                                                                                                                    

 1 Update the intention file (intention.txt) to document our assessment and reasoning.                                                                                                                                 
 2 Update model.cpp:                                                                                                                                                                                                   
    • For fast-growing coral dynamics: modify the recovery term in the prediction so that recovery is proportional to both the gap to maximum cover and the current (lagged) cover scaled by 100.                      
    • Similarly, update the slow-growing coral recovery dynamics.

 Assessment and improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                           
 1. Evaluation of the current model shows that while overall dynamics are captured, the recovery of coral communities is oversimplified.                                                                               
 2. The current recovery term (proportional to the gap to full cover) ignores density-dependent effects. In ecological systems, recovery is often most efficient at intermediate densities due to Allee effects: when  
 populations are too low, reproduction and recruitment are limited.                                                                                                                                                    
 3. To better capture the dynamics of episodic outbreaks and subsequent reef recovery, we modify the recovery term to be non-linear by multiplying the recovery gap by (current cover/100). This term slows recovery a 
 very low cover, reflecting reduced recruitment and potential self-facilitation at intermediate levels.

Don't re-send them.
Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.

Below is the fixed SEARCH/REPLACE block for the slow-growing coral dynamics. This block exactly matches the block in your file and replaces it with the updated, density‐dependent recovery term (note the closing     
parenthesis has also been corrected).

Below is the fixed SEARCH/REPLACE block that exactly matches the current content in POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_P5YHH1WX/model.cpp and updates the recovery term for slow-growing corals (and properly

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

Below is the updated SEARCH/REPLACE block for POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_P5YHH1WX/model.cpp. This block exactly matches the current content and replaces it with the updated fast- and slow-growing coral  
equations. In the replacement, we fix the missing closing parenthesis in the fast-growing coral term and modify the slow-growing coral recovery term to be density-dependent.
