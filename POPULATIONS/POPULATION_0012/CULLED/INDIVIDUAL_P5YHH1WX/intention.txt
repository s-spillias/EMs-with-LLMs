Assessment and improvement:
1. Evaluation of the current model shows that while overall dynamics are captured, the recovery of coral communities is oversimplified.
2. The current recovery term (proportional to the gap to full cover) ignores density-dependent effects. In ecological systems, recovery is often most efficient at intermediate densities due to Allee effects: when populations are too low, reproduction and recruitment are limited.
3. To better capture the dynamics of episodic outbreaks and subsequent reef recovery, we modify the recovery term to be non-linear by multiplying the recovery gap by (current cover/100). This term slows recovery at very low cover, reflecting reduced recruitment and potential self-facilitation at intermediate levels.
