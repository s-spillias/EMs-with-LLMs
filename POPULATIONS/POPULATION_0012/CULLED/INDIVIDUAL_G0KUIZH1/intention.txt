Our assessment indicates that while the current model reasonably captures the boom‚Äêbust dynamics of COTS via logistic growth, resource limitation, and a sigmoidal outbreak trigger, it may oversimplify environmental influences on COTS growth. Residual analysis suggests systematic deviations likely due to fluctuating environmental conditions. 

To improve ecological realism, we introduce a new parameter, "env_effect_on_growth", which acts as a multiplicative modifier on the intrinsic growth rate. This modifier captures additional environmental influences (e.g., temperature, nutrient availability) that can modulate the intensity and timing of outbreaks without using current time step observations.

This improvement adds ecological flexibility and preserves model structure by relying solely on previous time step values.
