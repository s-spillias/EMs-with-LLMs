Assessment and Reasoning:
Based on evaluation of the current model, the outbreak initiation mechanism is modeled using a logistic function that relies on the previous time step's COTS population relative to a threshold. Residual analysis suggests that the transition to outbreak can be more abrupt. To capture this, we introduce a higher‐order non‐linear outbreak trigger by raising the difference (cots_pred[t-1] - outbreak_threshold * carrying_capacity) to a new exponent parameter, outbreak_trigger_exponent. This change will sharpen the threshold response, enhancing the model's ability to capture rapid outbreak onset while adhering to the no data leakage rule.
