Assessment:
The current model produces basic boom-bust cycles; however, analysis of the residuals indicates that the outbreak decline phase is too gradual compared to observed data. Ecologically, at high COTS densities, competition, cannibalism, and resource limitation can intensify mortality sharply.
Improvement:
We introduce a non-linear (quadratic) dependence in the outbreak decline term. In the revised formulation, the decline is proportional to the square of the previous COTS population (normalized by the carrying capacity). This modification better reflects density-dependent mortality during outbreak peaks.
