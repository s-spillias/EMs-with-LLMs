Assessment:
The current model produces boom-bust dynamics for COTS outbreaks and incorporates coral loss via predation. However, the coral recovery process is modeled linearly as a constant recovery toward full cover (100%). This simplification neglects potential recruitment limitations that can occur when coral cover is very low (an Allee effect). To improve ecological realism, the recovery term is now modified to include a density-dependent factor (the previous coral cover divided by 100) so that recovery is slowed when coral cover is low. This enhancement better captures the dynamics of coral recovery while keeping predictions based solely on previous time-step values.
