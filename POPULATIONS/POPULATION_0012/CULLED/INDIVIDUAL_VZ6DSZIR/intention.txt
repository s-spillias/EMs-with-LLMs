Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model uses a fixed steepness value (100) for the outbreak trigger, which may be too rigid to capture observed variability in the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks. Residual analysis suggests that the onset of outbreaks is not consistently well‐predicted. To address this, we have introduced a new parameter, "outbreak_sharpness", replacing the fixed value. This change allows calibration of the logistic trigger’s steepness to reflect a more gradual or sharper transition as COTS numbers cross half the carrying capacity, in line with ecological expectations. This improvement adds flexibility without compromising the model’s simplicity and helps capture feedback mechanisms regulating outbreak initiation.
