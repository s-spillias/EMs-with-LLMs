Assessment:
The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS using logistic growth and outbreak-triggered decline, along with coral recovery dynamics. However, it omits a key ecological process: resource limitation. In reality, COTS growth is limited by the available coral prey. Therefore, we introduce a resource limitation mechanism in the growth term by scaling it with the total available coral cover (fast + slow). We also add a new parameter, "max_coral_cover," representing the maximum combined coral cover, to ensure proper scaling. This improvement enhances the model by linking COTS growth to the availability of food resources, which is crucial for accurately simulating outbreak events.
