Updated Assessment and Rationale:
The residual analysis indicated that the current logistic outbreak trigger underestimates the abrupt transition into outbreak conditions. Ecologically, COTS outbreaks exhibit a very sharp threshold behavior that a Hill function can better capture. 

To address this, the outbreak trigger has been modified:
• A new parameter, "trigger_hill_exponent" (default 3.0), has been introduced to control the nonlinearity, allowing a more abrupt triggering of outbreaks.
• The logistic trigger in the model was replaced with a Hill-function based trigger using normalized COTS levels, enhancing the ecological realism of boom-bust dynamics.

This change aims to improve the model’s ability to represent the characteristic sudden onset of COTS outbreaks observed on the Great Barrier Reef.
