Assessment and Improvement:
The current model uses a linear scaling of coral availability (via resource_limitation_strength) to affect COTS growth.
However, ecological evidence suggests that the benefit of increased coral cover saturates at higher levels.
To better capture the system dynamics and the characteristic boom–bust cycles in COTS outbreaks, we are replacing the linear term with a saturating (Michaelis–Menten type) function.
A new parameter, half_saturation, is introduced to represent the half‐saturation constant of coral availability.
This adjustment allows the model to capture rapid increases in growth at low coral cover while reflecting diminishing returns as cover increases.
