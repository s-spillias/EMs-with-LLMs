Assessment and Improvement:
After evaluating the residuals and model performance, we observed that the outbreak initiation mechanism appears overly linear. While the logistic function with a fixed threshold captures basic boom‐bust dynamics, it does not account for the cooperative, non‐linear processes that can precipitate rapid COTS outbreaks. 

Ecological Rationale:
To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_poly_modifier", which adds a quadratic amplification term to the outbreak trigger. This term reflects a cooperative effect whereby near-critical COTS densities yield a disproportionately high outbreak potential.

Model Changes:
1. Added "outbreak_poly_modifier" in parameters.json.
2. Updated model.cpp to include the new parameter and to revise the outbreak trigger calculation.
3. Ensured that all prediction calculations rely solely on the previous time step’s values to avoid data leakage.
