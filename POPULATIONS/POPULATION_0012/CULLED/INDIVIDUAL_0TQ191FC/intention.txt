This update was motivated by an assessment of the model, which indicated that while resource limitation via coral availability was incorporated into COTS growth, the outbreak trigger relied solely on COTS density relative to carrying capacity. Ecologically, healthy coral cover can help stabilize COTS populations by indirectly raising the threshold for outbreak initiation. To capture this dynamic feedback, I introduced the "coral_outbreak_modifier" parameter. This parameter adjusts the effective outbreak threshold based on the total coral cover (the sum of fast- and slow-growing coral predictions), thereby providing a more nuanced representation of the boom-bust cycles observed in COTS outbreaks.
