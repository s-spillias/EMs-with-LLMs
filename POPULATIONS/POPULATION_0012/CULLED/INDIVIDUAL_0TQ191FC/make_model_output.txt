Below are the proposed changes. The overall improvement is to incorporate an indirect feedback mechanism from coral cover into the     
outbreak trigger calculation. Ecologically, healthier coral cover may help to stabilize COTS populations by effectively raising the    
outbreak threshold. To implement this, we add a new parameter (coral_outbreak_modifier) in the parameters file and update the COTS     
trigger in the model. This modification clarifies that the outbreak threshold is dynamically adjusted based on the previous time step’s
total coral cover, without using current data values. Finally, we document our reasoning in the intention file.                        

Please confirm that these changes are acceptable.

We need to update POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_0TQ191FC/parameters.json with the new parameter.                              

Model file update:

 2 Update the outbreak trigger computation to use the new parameter.

We update POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_0TQ191FC/intention.txt to document the reasoning.

 This update was motivated by an assessment of the model, which indicated that while resource limitation via coral availability was    
 incorporated into COTS growth, the outbreak trigger relied solely on COTS density relative to carrying capacity. Ecologically, health 
 coral cover can help stabilize COTS populations by indirectly raising the threshold for outbreak initiation. To capture this dynamic  
 feedback, I introduced the "coral_outbreak_modifier" parameter. This parameter adjusts the effective outbreak threshold based on the  
 total coral cover (the sum of fast- and slow-growing coral predictions), thereby providing a more nuanced representation of the       
 boom-bust cycles observed in COTS outbreaks.

Below is the proposed change in POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_0TQ191FC/model.cpp to avoid potential NaN values in the outbreak
trigger calculation by ensuring the bases for the power functions are safely bounded away from zero.                                   

Please confirm that these changes are acceptable.
