Below is our plan for a single, ecologically meaningful improvement. We will address potential competitive resource limitation on coral recovery because in a real reef the available substrate is finite. When        
combined coral cover is high, recovery should be slowed to reflect competition between fast‐ and slow‐growing species. This change reinforces the boom–bust character of the system while ensuring that recovery does  
not overshoot available substrate.

    • Refactor the fast-growing coral recovery equation to include a competition factor based on the total coral cover (both fast and slow).

 Assessment and Improvement for the Crown-of-Thorns model:                                                                                                                                                             
 1. Model Assessment: The current model captures outbreak timing and magnitude well using logistic growth and outbreak-triggered decline. However, the coral recovery dynamics are overly simplistic.                  
 2. Ecological Reasoning: In reef systems, coral species compete for limited substrate. When overall coral cover is high, recovery becomes limited by available space.                                                 
 3. Proposed Improvement: Introduce a competition factor in the coral recovery terms. This will slow recovery as the sum of fast- and slow-growing coral cover increases, better reflecting resource limitation.
