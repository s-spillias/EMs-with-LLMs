Assessment and Improvement for the Crown-of-Thorns model:
1. Model Assessment: The current model captures outbreak timing and magnitude well using logistic growth and outbreak-triggered decline. However, the coral recovery dynamics are overly simplistic.
2. Ecological Reasoning: In reef systems, coral species compete for limited substrate. When overall coral cover is high, recovery becomes limited by available space.
3. Proposed Improvement: Introduce a competition factor in the coral recovery terms. This will slow recovery as the sum of fast- and slow-growing coral cover increases, better reflecting resource limitation.
