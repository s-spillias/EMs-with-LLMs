Assessment:
- The current model simulates COTS logistic growth with a sigmoid outbreak trigger based on the previous time step's COTS density raised to a fixed exponent (outbreak_shape). Residuals suggest that the outbreak initiation is too gradual relative to observed boomâ€“bust cycles.
- Ecologically, rapid outbreak onset may arise from non-linear feedbacks (e.g., cannibalism, resource depletion) that are not adequately captured by a simple power law.
Chosen Improvement:
- Enhance the outbreak trigger function by adding a cubic term to the outbreak signal. This creates a sharper, threshold-like response that transitions quickly once COTS densities exceed a critical level.
- This modification improves the model's ability to capture the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks while remaining parsimonious.
