Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
- The current model reasonably captures COTS outbreak dynamics with logistic growth and a smooth outbreak trigger.
- However, residuals suggest that the effect of environmental conditions on outbreak initiation is oversimplified.
- To better capture the non-linear sensitivity of outbreak initiation to environmental variability, we introduce a new parameter "environmental_outbreak_exponent". This parameter non-linearly scales the environmental modifier in the outbreak trigger function, allowing for amplification or dampening of outbreak triggers.
