This assessment indicates that while the current model captures the boom‚Äêbust dynamics of COTS, it oversimplifies the outbreak trigger by not incorporating feedback from coral cover decline. Ecologically, when coral cover remains low, it can destabilize the system further and lower the threshold for outbreak initiation. To capture this indirect feedback, we introduce the parameter "outbreak_coral_feedback" in the model. This parameter scales the effect of coral deficit on outbreak trigger sensitivity, thereby improving the timing, magnitude, and duration predictions of COTS outbreaks.
