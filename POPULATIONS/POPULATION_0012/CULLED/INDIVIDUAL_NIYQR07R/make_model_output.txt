Below is our proposed plan and explanation:                                                                                                                                                                            

Assessment & Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                 
We note that the current model captures boom‐bust dynamics via logistic growth with an outbreak trigger. However, by using only logistic growth at low densities, it may overestimate early-stage growth. Field studies
often show that marine populations like COTS can experience an Allee effect — a decline in per capita growth rate when densities are very low due to factors such as insufficient mate finding. This can lead to a more
realistic threshold behavior for outbreak initiation.                                                                                                                                                                  

Chosen Improvement                                                                                                                                                                                                     
We add an Allee effect by modifying the COTS growth term. In particular, we multiply the logistic growth by a factor:                                                                                                  
  cots_pred[t-1] / (cots_pred[t-1] + allee_threshold)                                                                                                                                                                  
This factor slows growth when the COTS population is low but approaches 1 at higher densities. We introduce a new parameter, allee_threshold, in both parameters.json (with ecological justification) and in model.cpp 
(to adjust the growth computation). We also update intention.txt with our assessment and reasoning.

 The current model effectively captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS populations using logistic growth modulated by an outbreak trigger. However, it oversimplifies early population dynamics by not accounting for  
 Allee effects, which are ecologically documented in many marine species.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 Incorporate an Allee effect into the COTS growth equation. Specifically, we multiply the logistic growth term by a factor:                                                                                            
     (cots_pred[t-1] / (cots_pred[t-1] + allee_threshold))                                                                                                                                                             
 This factor ensures that when COTS densities are very low, growth is significantly suppressed, capturing the difficulty of mate finding or cooperative behaviours at low densities.                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Ecological Justification:                                                                                                                                                                                             
 Allee effects are critical in depicting population regulation. They help explain why a population may need to exceed a critical density before rapid outbreak growth occurs. The new parameter “allee_threshold”      
 represents this minimum effective density, leading to more realistic predictions of outbreak timing and magnitude.
