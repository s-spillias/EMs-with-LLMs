Assessment:
The current model effectively captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS populations using logistic growth modulated by an outbreak trigger. However, it oversimplifies early population dynamics by not accounting for Allee effects, which are ecologically documented in many marine species.
 
Chosen Improvement:
Incorporate an Allee effect into the COTS growth equation. Specifically, we multiply the logistic growth term by a factor:
    (cots_pred[t-1] / (cots_pred[t-1] + allee_threshold))
This factor ensures that when COTS densities are very low, growth is significantly suppressed, capturing the difficulty of mate finding or cooperative behaviours at low densities.

Ecological Justification:
Allee effects are critical in depicting population regulation. They help explain why a population may need to exceed a critical density before rapid outbreak growth occurs. The new parameter “allee_threshold” represents this minimum effective density, leading to more realistic predictions of outbreak timing and magnitude.
