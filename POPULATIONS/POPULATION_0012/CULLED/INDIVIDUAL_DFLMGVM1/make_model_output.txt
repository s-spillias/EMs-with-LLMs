Below are the proposed changes. I will update the ecological intention text, add a new parameter explaining an exponential inhibition  
rate of coral recovery due to intense COTS outbreaks, and modify the coral recovery equations in the model so that during high outbreak
phases recovery is penalised exponentially rather than linearly. This approach is justified by ecological studies that show coral      
recovery can be significantly delayed or dampened when severe predation occurs, capturing a cascade of ecosystem damage. The changes   
also ensure that only past predictions are used in the dynamic equations.

 =======                                                                                                                               
 This model assessment reveals that while the current model captures the timing and general dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their impac 
 on coral communities, the recovery phase for corals appears systematically overestimated following extreme outbreaks. Residual analys 
 indicates that a purely linear inhibition of coral recovery under high COTS densities is insufficient to capture ecosystem inertia an 
 prolonged damage.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, we introduce an exponential inhibition term into the coral recovery equations. This modification better represents   
 ecological processes by imposing a stronger, non‐linear reduction in recovery when COTS densities are high, capturing cascading effec 
 of severe predation on coral resilience.
