This model assessment reveals that while the current model captures the timing and general dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their impacts on coral communities, the recovery phase for corals appears systematically overestimated following extreme outbreaks. Residual analysis indicates that a purely linear inhibition of coral recovery under high COTS densities is insufficient to capture ecosystem inertia and prolonged damage. 

To address this, we introduce an exponential inhibition term into the coral recovery equations. This modification better represents ecological processes by imposing a stronger, non‚Äêlinear reduction in recovery when COTS densities are high, capturing cascading effects of severe predation on coral resilience.
