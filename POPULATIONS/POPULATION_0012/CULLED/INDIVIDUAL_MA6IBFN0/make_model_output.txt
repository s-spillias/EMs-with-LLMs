Assessment and chosen improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                     
Our evaluation indicates that although the current model captures basic boom‐bust dynamics of COTS using logistic growth and a smooth outbreak trigger, the residuals suggest that the abrupt transitions during       
outbreak initiation are not fully captured. Ecologically, sudden outbreak events could result from nonlinear, threshold‐based effects. Therefore, we propose augmenting the outbreak trigger function with a cubic term
(via a new parameter outbreak_cubic). This higher‐order nonlinearity will allow the model to more flexibly capture the strong threshold behavior observed in outbreak events while still using only previous time-step 
values.

 The current model captures the basic COTS boom‐bust cycles, employing logistic growth and a smooth outbreak trigger based on environmental modifiers. However, an analysis of the residuals indicates the model       
 underestimates the abrupt transition at outbreak onset.                                                                                                                                                               
 Ecologically, outbreak initiation may involve nonlinear threshold effects that are better represented with a higher-order (cubic) term. To better capture the sharp transitions and improve the fit, we introduce a n 
 parameter "outbreak_cubic" to modify the outbreak trigger function.

After applying these changes you can rebuild/re-run the model to observe if the higher-order term improves the outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration predictions.
