Project Assessment:
The current model captures the basic COTS boom‚Äêbust cycles, employing logistic growth and a smooth outbreak trigger based on environmental modifiers. However, an analysis of the residuals indicates the model underestimates the abrupt transition at outbreak onset.
Ecologically, outbreak initiation may involve nonlinear threshold effects that are better represented with a higher-order (cubic) term. To better capture the sharp transitions and improve the fit, we introduce a new parameter "outbreak_cubic" to modify the outbreak trigger function.
