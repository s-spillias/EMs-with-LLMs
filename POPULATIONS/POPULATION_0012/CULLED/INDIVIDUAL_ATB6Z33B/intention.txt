Assessment:
After evaluating the model’s residuals and overall performance, it appears that while the logistic growth and outbreak dynamics generally capture the boom‐bust cycle of COTS, the outbreak trigger mechanism is too linear compared to the abrupt transitions observed in nature. To address this, I have introduced a new parameter, "outbreak_exponent", which applies a non‐linear transformation to the deviation of the COTS population from half the carrying capacity. This increases the sensitivity of outbreak onset when populations exceed a critical level, thereby better reflecting the ecological dynamics of rapid outbreak initiation.
