Below are the proposed changes. We will:                                                                                                                                                                               

 1 Update intention.txt with a brief assessment and explanation of our chosen improvement.                                                                                                                             
 2 Insert a new parameter "outbreak_exponent" into parameters.json with a clear ecological justification.                                                                                                              
 3 Update model.cpp by (a) adding a new TMB parameter outbreak_exponent (between outbreak_sharpness and handling_time) and (b) modifying the outbreak trigger calculation so that it uses a non‐linear exponent—that   
   is, the outbreak trigger now applies a non-linear transformation to the difference between the COTS population and half the carrying capacity.                                                                      

This improvement helps capture the abrupt transition typical of outbreak onset while remaining consistent with ecological theory. Note that the updated outbreak trigger uses values only from the previous time step  
to avoid data leakage.

 After evaluating the model’s residuals and overall performance, it appears that while the logistic growth and outbreak dynamics generally capture the boom‐bust cycle of COTS, the outbreak trigger mechanism is too  
 linear compared to the abrupt transitions observed in nature. To address this, I have introduced a new parameter, "outbreak_exponent", which applies a non‐linear transformation to the deviation of the COTS         
 population from half the carrying capacity. This increases the sensitivity of outbreak onset when populations exceed a critical level, thereby better reflecting the ecological dynamics of rapid outbreak initiation
