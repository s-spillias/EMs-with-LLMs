Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
1. The current model reasonably captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks but shows systematic discrepancies in early outbreak phases, as observed in the residuals.
2. The model applies logistic growth and outbreak-trigger functions; however, it appears to oversimplify the low-density reproduction dynamics.
3. We propose incorporating an Allee effect into the COTS growth equation to account for the ecological reality that very low densities may hinder effective reproduction.
4. The new parameter "cots_allee_threshold" represents the minimum population density below which the growth is curtailed.
This change adds ecological realism by capturing reduced growth efficiency at low densities, aligning with outbreak theory and minimizing data leakage by only using lagged (t-1) values.
