Assessment and Reasoning:
--------------------------
After evaluating the current model performance with the residuals, it is apparent that the outbreak trigger function may trigger outbreaks even when the COTS population is below ecologically relevant levels. 
The current method uses a direct difference of powered values, which may not isolate the true onset of outbreaks.
To address this, we now compute the excess of the COTS population (from the previous timestep) above the outbreak threshold (defined as a fraction of the carrying capacity) and apply a non-linear (power) function to this excess.
This modification ensures that the outbreak mechanism activates only when the population surpasses the critical threshold. 
The parameter "outbreak_shape" now controls the sensitivity of the trigger to the excess population, thereby improving the timing, magnitude, and transition dynamics of outbreak events.
