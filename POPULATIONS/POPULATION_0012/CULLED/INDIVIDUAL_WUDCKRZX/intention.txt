Assessment and Improvement:
The current model fits the COTS outbreak dynamics well but oversimplifies coral recovery by modeling it independently for fast- and slow-growing corals. In the real ecosystem, these coral groups compete for substrate (space), a key resource that limits recovery. To better capture this, we modify the recovery terms so that recovery depends on the available substrate 
(100 minus the sum of both coral covers). This adjustment incorporates resource limitation and competitive interactions, aligning the model more closely with ecological reality.
