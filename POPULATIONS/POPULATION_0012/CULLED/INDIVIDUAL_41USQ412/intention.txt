Assessment: 
Residual analysis indicates that although the model capably captures overall trends, it exhibits systematic misfit in predicting the precise timing and intensity of the outbreak events. The current outbreak trigger is based on a linear difference (cots_pred[t-1] minus a threshold) which may not fully capture the potential cooperative or aggregation effects observed in COTS behavior.

Improvement:
We introduce a non‐linear outbreak trigger by adding a new parameter “outbreak_trigger_exponent”. This exponent applies a power-law transformation to the COTS density in the outbreak trigger logistic function. Ecologically, higher starfish density may trigger outbreak events in a super-linear manner (e.g. due to aggregation or increased interaction rates), and this modification aims to capture that behavior.
