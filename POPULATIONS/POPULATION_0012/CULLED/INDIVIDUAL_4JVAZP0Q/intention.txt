Our assessment indicates that while the current model captures the boom-bust cycles via logistic growth and an outbreak trigger, it misses a key ecological feedback: the effect of coral resource availability on COTS reproduction. In reality, abundant coral can promote higher COTS growth (providing food), while depleted coral may constrain further outbreaks. To capture this, we introduce a new parameter ("coral_effect_on_growth") that modulates COTS growth rate by a multiplier based on the combined previous coral cover. This change should improve the modelâ€™s ability to reflect the resource-limited dynamics of outbreaks.
