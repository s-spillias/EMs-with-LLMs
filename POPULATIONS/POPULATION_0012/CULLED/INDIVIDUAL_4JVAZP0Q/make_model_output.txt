Below are the proposed changes. We are (i) documenting our assessment/reasoning in intentions.txt, (ii) adding a new parameter ("coral_effect_on_growth") to account for the effect of available coral (prey) on the   
COTS growth rate, and (iii) updating the model in model.cpp to include this new ecological feedback. The idea is that when coral availability (combined fast- and slow-growing coral cover) is high, the COTS growth is
boosted, whereas when it is low the growth is reduced. This feedback represents resource limitation and allows the model to better capture boom‐bust dynamics. Note that only past predictions (t‑1) are used in the   
calculations.

 Our assessment indicates that while the current model captures the boom-bust cycles via logistic growth and an outbreak trigger, it misses a key ecological feedback: the effect of coral resource availability on CO 
 reproduction. In reality, abundant coral can promote higher COTS growth (providing food), while depleted coral may constrain further outbreaks. To capture this, we introduce a new parameter                         
 ("coral_effect_on_growth") that modulates COTS growth rate by a multiplier based on the combined previous coral cover. This change should improve the model’s ability to reflect the resource-limited dynamics of     
 outbreaks.
