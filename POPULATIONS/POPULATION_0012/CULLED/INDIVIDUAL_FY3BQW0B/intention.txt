Assessment and rationale:
The current model achieves a reasonable dynamic by modeling logistic COTS growth and saturating coral recovery. However, residual analysis indicates that the observed outbreak events are not fully captured by the linear predation efficiency assumption. Ecologically, predation efficiency on coral might be more sensitive to coral cover when availability crosses certain thresholds. 

To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "predation_efficiency_exponent", that nonlinearly scales the effect of coral cover in the predation term. Values greater than 1 will amplify the impact of high coral cover on predation, better reflecting the rapid switch from low to high predation efficiency. This addition provides a more realistic trigger for outbreak events by capturing threshold dynamics in predation.
