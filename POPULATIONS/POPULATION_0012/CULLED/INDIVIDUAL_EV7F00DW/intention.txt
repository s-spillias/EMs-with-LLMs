Assessment:
Based on the analysis of residuals and model performance, the current model underestimates the rapid collapse during COTS outbreak phases. To address this, I propose adding a density‚Äêdependent mortality term that activates when the predicted COTS population exceeds the outbreak threshold (defined as a fraction of the carrying capacity). This quadratic term captures ecological feedbacks such as increased predation or resource limitations at high densities, thereby improving the timing, magnitude, and duration predictions of the boom-bust cycles.
