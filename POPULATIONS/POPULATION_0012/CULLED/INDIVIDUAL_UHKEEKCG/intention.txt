MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model includes sophisticated mechanisms for COTS population dynamics including:
- Allee effects for low-density dynamics
- Density-dependent fecundity enhancement (recently added)
- Temperature effects on larval survival
- Nutrient-mediated larval survival using SST anomalies as proxy

However, the nutrient mechanism (Equation 1b) uses an unbounded exponential function:
  nutrient_enhancement = exp(nutrient_effect_strength * positive_anomaly)

IDENTIFIED PROBLEM:
1. Exponential growth is ecologically unrealistic - larval survival cannot increase indefinitely
2. The mechanism conflates temperature effects (already captured in temp_effect_cots) with nutrient effects
3. COTS outbreak literature emphasizes THRESHOLD responses to nutrient pulses, not gradual exponential increases
4. The current formulation may produce unrealistically high recruitment during extended warm periods

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANGE:
Crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks are triggered by episodic nutrient pulses from terrestrial runoff (flood events).
These pulses:
- Increase phytoplankton productivity (larval food)
- Have a saturating effect (beyond a threshold, additional nutrients don't proportionally increase survival)
- Create discrete recruitment pulses rather than gradual increases
- Show threshold behavior: weak response at low nutrient levels, strong response above a critical threshold

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Replace the exponential nutrient enhancement with a SATURATING HILL FUNCTION (cooperative binding model):

  nutrient_enhancement = 1 + max_nutrient_boost * (anomaly^n) / (halfsat^n + anomaly^n)

Where:
- max_nutrient_boost: maximum fold-increase in larval survival during high nutrient conditions
- halfsat: SST anomaly threshold for half-maximal nutrient effect (proxy for nutrient pulse intensity)
- n: Hill coefficient controlling response steepness (higher = sharper threshold)

This formulation:
1. Bounds enhancement between 1x (baseline) and (1 + max_nutrient_boost)x
2. Creates threshold behavior appropriate for episodic nutrient pulses
3. Separates nutrient effects from temperature effects on development
4. Allows strong but realistic recruitment pulses during outbreak-triggering conditions

MATHEMATICAL CHANGES:
- Replace log_nutrient_effect parameter with log_max_nutrient_boost (bounded enhancement)
- Add log_nutrient_halfsat parameter (threshold for nutrient response)
- Add nutrient_hill_coef parameter (steepness of threshold response)
- Modify Equation 1b to use Hill function instead of exponential

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOME:
- More realistic episodic recruitment pulses
- Better capture of outbreak initiation timing
- Bounded larval survival enhancement
- Clearer separation of temperature vs. nutrient effects
- Improved ability to model boom-bust cycles with distinct triggering events
