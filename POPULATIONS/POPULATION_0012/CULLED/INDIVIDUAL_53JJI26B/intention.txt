Model Assessment and Improvement:
-----------------------------------
1. Assessment:
   - The current model predicts boom-bust cycles of COTS by using logistic growth modified by an outbreak-triggered decline.
   - Observations suggest that while the model fits data moderately well, it does not account for resource limitations imposed by coral cover decline.
   - The model also uses fixed COTS carrying capacity, which may not capture the ecological feedback where reduced coral cover limits food/habitat.
2. Proposed Improvement:
   - Introduce a dynamic carrying capacity for COTS that scales with available coral cover.
   - Effective capacity = carrying_capacity * ((fast_pred + slow_pred) / 200 + eps), where 200 represents the maximum combined coral cover.
   - This change integrates a resource limitation mechanism into the ecological model, providing a more robust representation of outbreak dynamics.
