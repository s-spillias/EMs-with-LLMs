Assessment and Ecological Improvement:
The current model captures the episodic boom-bust dynamics of COTS and their impact on coral communities.
However, the predation losses on coral are currently modeled using a simple saturating function that may not account for
threshold-like responses observed during outbreak events. In real ecosystems, coral predation efficiency can change non-linearly
with coral cover due to cooperative behaviors among COTS or shifts in coral vulnerability.
To better capture these dynamics, a new parameter "predation_nonlinearity" is introduced as an exponent on the saturation term.
This allows for a more flexible response, where small differences in coral cover may yield large differences in predation losses.
This improvement is designed to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to simulate rapid coral collapse during high COTS outbreaks.
