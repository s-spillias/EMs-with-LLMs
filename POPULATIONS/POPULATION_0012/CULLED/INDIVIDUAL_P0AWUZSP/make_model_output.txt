 1 Parameters Update: We add a new parameter called resource_limitation_exponent to capture a non‐linear (power law) effect of coral availability on COTS growth. This reflects the idea that coral availability may have a threshold effect—i.e. once coral cover exceeds a critical level, COTS growth increases non‐linearly.                                                       
 2 Model Update:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    • We declare the new parameter in the parameter declarations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
    • In the growth equation (Equation 1 for COTS dynamics), we change the resource limitation term to use a power function (using the new exponent) instead of a linear scaling.                                                                                                                                                                                                      
    • We verified that all calculations use previous time step predictions only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 3 Intention Update: We document our assessment and the ecological reasoning behind the added non‐linear resource limitation term in intention.txt.

 1. The residual analysis indicated that while the model captures the general trend of COTS outbreaks, the current resource limitation mechanism based on coral availability is overly simplistic. A linear scaling may underestimate threshold effects where coral cover substantially influences COTS population expansion.                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 2. To address this, we introduced a non-linear resource limitation term by adding the parameter "resource_limitation_exponent". This exponent allows the model to capture a more pronounced threshold effect in the impact of coral availability on COTS growth. Ecologically, this modification reflects that beyond a critical level of coral cover, starfish growth can accelerate 
 non-linearly, while below that threshold, growth is strongly suppressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 3. This change enhances the ecological realism of the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks in the Great Barrier Reef by better representing feedback mechanisms between coral availability and COTS growth.
