Assessment and update:

1. The residual analysis indicated that while the model captures the general trend of COTS outbreaks, the current resource limitation mechanism based on coral availability is overly simplistic. A linear scaling may underestimate threshold effects where coral cover substantially influences COTS population expansion.

2. To address this, we introduced a non-linear resource limitation term by adding the parameter "resource_limitation_exponent". This exponent allows the model to capture a more pronounced threshold effect in the impact of coral availability on COTS growth. Ecologically, this modification reflects that beyond a critical level of coral cover, starfish growth can accelerate non-linearly, while below that threshold, growth is strongly suppressed.

3. This change enhances the ecological realism of the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks in the Great Barrier Reef by better representing feedback mechanisms between coral availability and COTS growth.
