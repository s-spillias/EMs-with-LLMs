Assessment:

The current model captures COTS logistic growth, outbreak-trigger decline, and incorporates environmental modifiers and resource availability. However, it oversimplifies the feedback between coral availability and outbreak decline. In nature, intense predation during outbreaks can deplete coral cover, which in turn accelerates the decline phase due to lack of prey support.

Improvement:
We introduce a new feedback mechanism via the parameter "coral_dep_decline" that scales the outbreak decline. When coral cover is low, this factor boosts the decline term, better capturing the rapid bust phase driven by prey depletion.
