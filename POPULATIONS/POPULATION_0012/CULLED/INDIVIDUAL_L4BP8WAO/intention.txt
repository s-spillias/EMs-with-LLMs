Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:

The current model effectively captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks; however, the resource limitation component is oversimplified. The effect of coral availability on COTS growth is modeled in a linear fashion after applying a saturating Michaelis–Menten function, which may not adequately capture non-linear resource effects observed in complex ecological systems.

To address this, I have introduced a new parameter "nonlinear_resource_exponent" and modified the resource availability computation to incorporate a non-linear exponent. This change allows for a more flexible response to varying coral cover, potentially capturing synergistic or threshold effects that drive abrupt outbreak transitions. This adjustment is ecologically justified as environmental feedbacks and competition often produce non-linear dynamics.

This change should improve the model’s ability to predict outbreak timings, magnitudes, and durations under variable ecological conditions.
