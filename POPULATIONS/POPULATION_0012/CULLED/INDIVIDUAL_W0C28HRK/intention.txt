Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
- The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations but underestimates the abruptness of outbreak onset.
- Residuals indicate that the transition from low to high COTS numbers is sharper than predicted.
- To improve ecological realism, we add a non-linear component to the outbreak trigger function.
- A new parameter "outbreak_nonlinearity_exponent" (default value 2.0) is introduced to amplify small deviations from half carrying capacity.
- This change better represents the rapid ecological response observed in outbreak events.
