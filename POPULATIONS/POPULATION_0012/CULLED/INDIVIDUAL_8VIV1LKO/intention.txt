Assessment:
The residuals indicate that the previous model may not fully capture the hysteresis seen in COTS outbreaks. Observed boom–bust cycles suggest that outbreak initiation requires a relatively high density (a threshold) and that outbreaks persist until COTS numbers fall significantly below that threshold. 

Improvement:
We introduce separate outbreak onset and outbreak offset thresholds to implement hysteresis in the outbreak‐trigger mechanism. This discrete switching approach (using only previous time step values) prevents data leakage and better mimics ecological reality—where outbreaks are not instantly terminated upon slight population drops and show delayed recovery. The new parameters, outbreak_onset_threshold and outbreak_offset_threshold, provide more flexibility to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.

Reasoning:
- Ecologically, outbreak events require a sustained high density before triggering.
- Once established, outbreaks persist even if the density falls somewhat.
- This improvement is justified to better capture the complex, non‐linear dynamics observed in COTS populations.
