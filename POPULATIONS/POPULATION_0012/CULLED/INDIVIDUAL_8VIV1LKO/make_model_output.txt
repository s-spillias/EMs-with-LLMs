Below is our plan. We have updated the model documentation (in intention.txt) with an assessment and our chosen improvement. In parameters.json we remove the single outbreak threshold and introduce two parameters (outbreak_onset_threshold and outbreak_offset_threshold) to implement hysteresis in outbreak triggering. In model.cpp we remove the old outbreak trigger          
computation that used outbreak_threshold and replace it with a discrete hysteresis mechanism (using only previous time‐step values) that switches outbreak “on” when the population exceeds the onset threshold and “off” when it falls below the offset threshold. This change is ecologically justified by the well‐documented hysteresis in outbreak dynamics (i.e. outbreaks start 
only once COTS reach a high density and do not immediately end as numbers fall slightly, capturing the boom–bust cycle more realistically).

 The residuals indicate that the previous model may not fully capture the hysteresis seen in COTS outbreaks. Observed boom–bust cycles suggest that outbreak initiation requires a relatively high density (a threshold) and that outbreaks persist until COTS numbers fall significantly below that threshold.

 We introduce separate outbreak onset and outbreak offset thresholds to implement hysteresis in the outbreak‐trigger mechanism. This discrete switching approach (using only previous time step values) prevents data leakage and better mimics ecological reality—where outbreaks are not instantly terminated upon slight population drops and show delayed recovery. The new        
 parameters, outbreak_onset_threshold and outbreak_offset_threshold, provide more flexibility to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.

 - Ecologically, outbreak events require a sustained high density before triggering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 - Once established, outbreaks persist even if the density falls somewhat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 - This improvement is justified to better capture the complex, non‐linear dynamics observed in COTS populations.

Below are the proposed changes to the model.cpp file. These modifications remove the old parameter declaration of outbreak_threshold and add the new parameters outbreak_onset_threshold and outbreak_offset_threshold in its place. This will resolve the undeclared identifiers error in the outbreak trigger logic.

Below are the proposed changes to smooth the hysteresis update and avoid non‐differentiability issues. We remove the discrete outbreak_active flag and instead use a continuous update using logistic functions to blend from the previous outbreak state to the new state based on onset and offset thresholds. This should avoid NA/NaN gradient evaluations.
