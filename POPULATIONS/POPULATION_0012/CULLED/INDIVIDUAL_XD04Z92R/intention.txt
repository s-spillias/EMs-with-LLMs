This update reflects our assessment that the current model, while capturing basic outbreak triggers, is missing an explicit resource limitation mechanism for COTS. When the available coral (combined fast- and slow-growing cover) is low, reduced prey availability should drive additional COTS mortality. Thus, we insert an extra mortality term in the COTS dynamics that subtracts coral_resource_effect * cots_pred[t-1] scaled by the deficit in coral cover (computed as 1 - ((fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / 200)). This added feedback helps capture the boom-bust nature of COTS outbreaks in a more ecologically realistic manner.
