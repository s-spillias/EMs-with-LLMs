Assessment:
The current model employs a logistic outbreak trigger based solely on the previous time step's COTS prediction. Our residual analysis indicates that occasional short-term spikes may spur premature outbreak triggering.
Improvement:
To better reflect ecological inertia, the outbreak trigger is modified to use the average of the two most recent COTS predictions. This “outbreak inertia” mechanism ensures that only sustained high densities initiate an outbreak, providing a more robust representation of the system dynamics.
