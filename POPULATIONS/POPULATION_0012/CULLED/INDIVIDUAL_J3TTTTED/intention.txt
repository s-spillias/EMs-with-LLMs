Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model fits the observed data using a logistic growth framework with an outbreak-triggered decline based on a linear threshold. However, the rapid onset of COTS outbreaks and subsequent boomâ€“bust cycles observed in the Great Barrier Reef may involve a more nonlinear threshold response. We propose incorporating a non-linear exponent ('outbreak_exponent') into the outbreak trigger. This change allows the outbreak trigger to scale as a power of the relative COTS density (cots_pred relative to carrying_capacity), providing a flexible mechanism that can accentuate rapid transitions. This refinement is ecologically justified as it better captures the accelerating nature of outbreak onset under certain environmental conditions.
