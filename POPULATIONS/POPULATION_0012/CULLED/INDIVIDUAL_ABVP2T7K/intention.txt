Assessment:
The current model effectively captures the basic boom-bust dynamics, but residuals indicate some timing deviations, particularly in outbreak onset. The outbreak trigger is solely determined by a fixed parameter (`outbreak_sharpness`), which can oversimplify the influence of variable environmental conditions.
Improvement:
Introduce a new parameter `environmental_modifier` to dynamically adjust the outbreak trigger. This multiplier captures environmental influences (e.g. temperature anomalies) that can accelerate or delay outbreak onset, offering a more nuanced and ecologically realistic representation of the system dynamics.
