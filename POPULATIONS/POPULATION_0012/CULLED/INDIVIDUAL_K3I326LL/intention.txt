Assessment and Improvement:
The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS and their predation on coral; however, residuals indicate systematic discrepancies likely due to a constant predation efficiency. Ecologically, when coral cover falls, predation efficiency should diminish as the prey becomes less available or harder to detect.
Improvement Chosen:
Introduce a saturating functional response by adding a new parameter, "predation_scaler", to scale coral predation efficiency relative to coral cover. This improvement incorporates resource limitation effects and improves the realism of the predation process.
