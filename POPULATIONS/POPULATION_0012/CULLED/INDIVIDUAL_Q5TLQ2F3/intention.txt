Assessment and Reasoning:
1. The current model captures boom-bust dynamics of COTS reasonably well; however, residuals indicate discrepancies in outbreak timing and magnitude.
2. While the model incorporates resource limitation and a smooth outbreak trigger, it oversimplifies environmental influences on outbreak onset.
3. As an improvement, we introduce an environmental trigger modifier (env_trigger_modifier) to adjust the effective outbreak threshold. This reflects that under adverse environmental conditions, outbreaks may be triggered at lower COTS densities.
4. This addition enhances model realism by linking outbreak sensitivity directly to environmental conditions.
