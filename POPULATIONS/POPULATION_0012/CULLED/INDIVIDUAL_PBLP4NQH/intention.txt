Assessment and Improvement:
The current model uses a linear logistic outbreak trigger, which does not fully capture the abrupt transitions typical of Crown-of-Thorns starfish outbreaks. Residual analysis indicates systematic deviations that suggest a nonlinear threshold mechanism may better represent the dynamics. By introducing a new parameter, "outbreak_exponent", we apply a power‐law to the normalized COTS density. Values >1 will produce a sharper transition at the outbreak threshold, capturing the sudden onset and rapid decline observed ecologically.
