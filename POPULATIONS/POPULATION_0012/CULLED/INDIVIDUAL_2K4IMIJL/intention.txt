Assessment:
The current model captures logistic growth combined with an outbreak trigger using a linear exponential factor. However, residuals analysis indicates that the outbreak dynamics are underrepresented when COTS exceed a threshold. Small increases above this threshold appear to lead to disproportionately large outbreak effectsâ€”a non-linear response often observed in ecological systems.
To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_nonlinearity" (default value 2.0), which serves as an exponent on the difference between the previous COTS population and the outbreak threshold. This change allows the model to more realistically capture the steep, non-linear transition observed during outbreak events, and thus better align predictions with observed boom-bust cycles.
Additionally, we ensure that only previous time-step values are used to avoid data leakage, in line with best practices.
