Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model fits the data moderately well in capturing the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks through logistic growth tempered by outbreak-triggered decline.
2. However, it oversimplifies the prey (coral) availability effect on COTS growth by not linking the predatorâ€™s growth rate to the available coral cover.
3. Ecologically, resource (coral) limitation is a key factor: outbreaks tend to be sustained when coral prey is abundant and diminish when available coral declines.
4. To incorporate this, we have modified the COTS growth term to include a normalized factor for total coral cover (fast + slow coral), thereby imposing a resource limitation that better captures the boom-bust dynamics.
