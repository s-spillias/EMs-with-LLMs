Model Assessment:
Based on analysis of the residuals, the current model reasonably captures overall trends but underestimates the nonlinearity in coral predation during periods of high coral cover. To address this, we introduce a new parameter “predation_exponent” which modulates the non‐linear increase in predation efficiency. Ecologically, this represents threshold effects where predation pressure accelerates once coral cover exceeds a certain level. This added nonlinearity is justified as it provides a more accurate representation of the variable efficiency of COTS predation on coral communities.
