MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model includes several key mechanisms for COTS-coral dynamics:
1. Allee effects at low COTS densities (important for outbreak initiation)
2. Temperature-dependent larval survival for COTS
3. Nutrient-mediated enhancement of larval survival (recently added)
4. Type II functional responses for selective coral predation
5. Bleaching effects on coral communities
6. Competition between fast and slow-growing coral types

Parameter Review:
- temp_opt_coral was updated from literature to 29.0°C (bounds: 28.0-30.0°C)
- This is very close to temp_opt_cots (28.5°C), indicating overlapping thermal niches
- This ecological reality is appropriately captured in the current temperature response functions

=== IDENTIFIED GAPS ===

The PROJECT CONTEXT emphasizes "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" with "characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline."

Key missing mechanism:
DENSITY-DEPENDENT FECUNDITY - COTS are broadcast spawners that exhibit strong aggregation behavior during outbreaks. At high densities, fertilization success increases dramatically due to:
- Proximity of spawning individuals
- Synchronized spawning events
- Higher gamete concentrations in the water column

This creates a positive feedback mechanism that:
- Amplifies outbreak magnitude (more adults → more successful reproduction → more recruits)
- Extends outbreak duration (sustained high recruitment during boom phase)
- Sharpens boom-bust transitions (feedback weakens as density declines)

This is DISTINCT from the existing Allee effect, which operates at LOW densities to prevent population establishment. Density-dependent fecundity operates at HIGH densities to sustain outbreaks.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add a density-dependent fecundity multiplier to the COTS recruitment equation.

Mathematical form: Saturating function that increases reproductive output at high densities
- At low densities: minimal enhancement (baseline reproduction)
- At intermediate densities: rapid increase in per-capita fecundity
- At high densities: saturation (physiological/behavioral limits)

Implementation:
fecundity_enhancement = 1 + (max_fecundity_boost * cots_density^fecundity_exponent) / (fecundity_halfsat^fecundity_exponent + cots_density^fecundity_exponent)

Where:
- max_fecundity_boost: maximum fold-increase in per-capita fecundity at high density
- fecundity_halfsat: COTS density at which fecundity enhancement is half-maximal
- fecundity_exponent: controls steepness of the response (Hill coefficient)

New parameters added:
1. log_max_fecundity_boost: log of maximum fecundity enhancement (dimensionless, typically 2-10x)
2. log_fecundity_halfsat: log of half-saturation density for fecundity response (individuals/m²)
3. fecundity_exponent: Hill coefficient for fecundity response steepness (dimensionless, typically 2-4)

Ecological justification:
- Literature shows COTS fertilization success increases with density
- Aggregation behavior is well-documented during outbreaks
- This mechanism is critical for sustaining the "boom" phase of boom-bust cycles
- Creates realistic outbreak dynamics: slow buildup → rapid explosion → sustained peak → crash

Expected improvements:
- More pronounced boom-bust cycles
- Better capture of outbreak magnitude
- Improved timing of population peaks
- More realistic outbreak duration
- Sharper transitions between outbreak and non-outbreak states

This single mechanism addresses the core PROJECT CONTEXT requirement of accurately modeling "episodic outbreaks" and "population explosions" while maintaining model parsimony.
