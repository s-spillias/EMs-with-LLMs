MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Density-dependent fecundity enhancement captures outbreak self-amplification
2. Allee effects represent low-density dynamics and outbreak thresholds
3. Nutrient-mediated larval survival provides environmental triggering mechanism
4. Type II functional responses realistically model coral predation
5. Separate fast/slow coral dynamics capture community composition changes

Weaknesses Identified:
1. Missing resource-dependent starvation mortality during coral depletion
2. No explicit mechanism for rapid population collapse during "bust" phase
3. Outbreak termination relies only on density-dependent mortality, not resource limitation
4. May not capture the asymmetric boom-bust dynamics (rapid crash after slow buildup)

Parameter Analysis:
- log_nutrient_effect = 0.0 suggests weak environmental triggering
- log_max_fecundity_boost = 1.609 (5x) shows strong density-dependent reproduction
- Density-dependent fecundity appears to be primary outbreak mechanism
- Current mortality terms (baseline + density-dependent) may be insufficient for bust dynamics

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add Resource-Dependent Starvation Mortality

Ecological Rationale:
COTS are obligate coral predators that cannot switch to alternative food sources. During outbreak progression, COTS populations deplete coral resources faster than coral can regenerate. When per-capita coral availability falls below critical levels, COTS experience mass starvation. This creates the characteristic rapid "bust" phase that follows the slower "boom" buildup - a key feature emphasized in the PROJECT CONTEXT.

Current model gap: Outbreak collapse relies only on density-dependent mortality (crowding effects), missing the critical feedback where resource depletion accelerates population crash.

Mathematical Implementation:
Add starvation mortality term to Equation 11 (COTS dynamics):

starvation_mort = max_starvation_rate * (1 - (per_capita_coral^starvation_exponent) / (starvation_threshold^starvation_exponent + per_capita_coral^starvation_exponent))

Where:
- per_capita_coral = total_coral / (cots_pred(t-1) + eps)
- Reverse Hill function: mortality HIGH when per-capita coral LOW
- Sharp transition at starvation_threshold
- starvation_exponent controls transition steepness

New Parameters:
1. log_max_starvation_rate: Maximum starvation mortality rate (year^-1)
   - Range: exp(-0.693) to exp(1.609) = 0.5 to 5.0 year^-1
   - Justification: Starvation can cause rapid mortality (weeks to months)
   
2. log_starvation_threshold: Per-capita coral availability below which starvation occurs (% cover per individual)
   - Range: exp(-2.303) to exp(2.303) = 0.1 to 10.0 % per ind/mÂ²
   - Justification: COTS need ~1-5% coral cover per individual for maintenance
   
3. starvation_exponent: Hill coefficient for starvation response steepness
   - Range: 2.0 to 8.0 (dimensionless)
   - Justification: Starvation threshold should be sharp (high cooperativity)

Expected Outcomes:
1. Faster, more realistic outbreak collapse when coral depleted
2. Better capture of asymmetric boom-bust cycles
3. Resource-mediated population regulation (not just density)
4. Improved fit to observed rapid COTS decline phases
5. Mechanistic link between coral depletion and outbreak termination

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions" by adding the key mechanism that terminates outbreaks and creates the characteristic bust phase.
