This update assesses the current model for COTS outbreaks and coral dynamics. The residual patterns indicate that the outbreak onset may be underestimated in its abruptness. 

To better capture the explosive nature of COTS outbreaks – where environmental factors (e.g., temperature anomalies or nutrient surges) may lead to a sudden and nonlinear response – we introduce a quadratic term in the outbreak trigger function. This modification reflects the idea that once the population exceeds a threshold, the environmental influences can rapidly intensify the outbreak.

A new parameter, "environmental_nonlinearity", is introduced to quantify this non-linear feedback. This improvement enhances our mechanistic representation of outbreak initiation without causing data leakage (using only previous time step values) and is ecologically justified given observed abrupt outbreak dynamics.
