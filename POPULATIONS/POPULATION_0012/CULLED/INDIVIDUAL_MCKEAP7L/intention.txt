Assessment and Ecological Improvement Rationale:

After evaluating the residuals and model performance within the context of modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, we identified a key missing ecological process: a feedback mechanism whereby low coral cover (the sum of fast and slow coral communities) suppresses outbreak triggers due to limited prey availability for COTS reproduction.

To address this, two new parameters have been introduced:
- coral_outbreak_threshold: The total coral cover threshold below which the outbreak trigger is dampened, representing insufficient prey levels.
- coral_feedback_sharpness: A modifier that controls the steepness of the coral feedback on the outbreak trigger, ensuring a sharper suppression effect when coral levels fall below the threshold.

The outbreak trigger in the COTS dynamics is now calculated by combining the original COTS‚Äêdependent term with this coral feedback, using only previous time step predictions to avoid data leakage. This improvement adds ecological realism by accounting for reduced COTS reproduction under low-prey conditions.
