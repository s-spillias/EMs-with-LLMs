Assessment and Reasoning:
--------------------------
The current model provides a reasonable fit overall; however, its outbreak trigger is modeled with a simple logistic formulation. Residual analysis indicates systematic discrepancies at the transition phase, suggesting that a higher-order (quadratic) response is needed to capture the rapid acceleration in COTS outbreaks. 

We add a new parameter "outbreak_nonlinearity" to introduce a quadratic term in the outbreak trigger function. This improved representation better captures the threshold-like behavior of outbreak initiation, aligning with ecological observations of burst dynamics. The added complexity is justified by the need to reconcile the timing, magnitude, and duration of observed boom-bust cycles.
