Below are the proposed changes. First, we update intention.txt to document our assessment and rationale. Next, we add a new parameter to parameters.json to capture nonlinear outbreak dynamics, and then modify       
model.cpp to (1) declare the new parameter and (2) update the outbreak trigger calculation to include a quadratic (nonlinear) term. The added quadratic term is ecologically justified to better capture the sudden    
acceleration in COTS outbreak once the population exceeds a threshold.

 The current model provides a reasonable fit overall; however, its outbreak trigger is modeled with a simple logistic formulation. Residual analysis indicates systematic discrepancies at the transition phase,       
 suggesting that a higher-order (quadratic) response is needed to capture the rapid acceleration in COTS outbreaks.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 We add a new parameter "outbreak_nonlinearity" to introduce a quadratic term in the outbreak trigger function. This improved representation better captures the threshold-like behavior of outbreak initiation,       
 aligning with ecological observations of burst dynamics. The added complexity is justified by the need to reconcile the timing, magnitude, and duration of observed boom-bust cycles.
