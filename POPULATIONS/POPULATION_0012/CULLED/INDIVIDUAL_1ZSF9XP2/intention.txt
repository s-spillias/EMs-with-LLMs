Assessment:
The current model uses logistic growth for COTS and a smooth outbreak-triggered decline modulated by a linear coral influence.
However, using a simple linear term for coral influence oversimplifies the resource limitation feedback.
Ecologically, the effect of coral cover on modulating outbreak triggering is expected to saturate, which is better captured by a Hill function.
Therefore, we introduce a non-linear (Hill function) representation by adding two parameters:
 - "coral_effect_half": the coral cover level at which the feedback is half-maximal.
 - "hill_exponent": controls the steepness of the non-linear response.
This change should better capture the dynamics of episodic COTS outbreaks while ensuring no current step data leakage.
