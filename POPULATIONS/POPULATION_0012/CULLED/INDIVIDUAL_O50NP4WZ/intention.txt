MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a mechanistically detailed COTS-coral predator-prey system with:
- Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response around optimal SST)
- Nutrient-mediated larval survival using SST as environmental proxy
- Age-structured mortality transitioning from high juvenile to lower adult rates
- Type II functional response for selective coral predation
- Logistic coral growth with dynamic carrying capacities and interspecific competition

STRENGTHS:
- Captures age structure through maturity state variable
- Implements realistic predation preferences (fast > slow corals)
- Includes multiple density-dependent feedbacks (Allee, crowding, food limitation)
- Accounts for coral competition for benthic space

WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED:
1. **Indirect outbreak trigger mechanism**: Uses SST deviation as proxy for phytoplankton bloom conditions, but COTS outbreak literature emphasizes direct link between terrestrial runoff/nutrients and larval survival
2. **Missing temporal dynamics of blooms**: Phytoplankton blooms develop over weeks-months following rainfall events, but model uses instantaneous SST values
3. **Oversimplified environmental forcing**: Temperature alone cannot capture episodic nature of nutrient pulses from wet season flooding

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT SELECTED ===

**IMPROVEMENT: Add explicit phytoplankton bloom state variable with temporal dynamics**

ECOLOGICAL RATIONALE:
Crown-of-thorns outbreaks on the GBR are strongly associated with:
- Wet season flooding events delivering terrestrial nutrients
- Resulting phytoplankton blooms providing food for COTS larvae
- Multi-year sequences of high rainfall creating sustained favorable conditions
- This creates the episodic "boom" phase of boom-bust cycles

The current model uses SST as an indirect proxy (cooler SST during wet season), but this:
- Misses the direct causal mechanism (nutrients → phytoplankton → larval food)
- Cannot capture inter-annual variability in rainfall/runoff
- Lacks the temporal lag between rainfall and bloom development

PROPOSED MECHANISM:
Add phytoplankton bloom state variable that:

1. **Bloom dynamics**: dB/dt = bloom_response * nutrient_proxy - bloom_decay * B
   - Currently uses SST as proxy for wet season nutrient conditions (Gaussian centered at 26.5°C)
   - Blooms accumulate during favorable conditions and decay over time
   - This creates temporal integration of environmental forcing

2. **Bloom-dependent larval survival**: 
   - survival = base_survival * (1 + bloom_amplification * B / (B + half_saturation))
   - Michaelis-Menten saturation: small blooms have little effect, large blooms dramatically increase recruitment
   - Creates threshold behavior consistent with outbreak dynamics

3. **Temporal persistence**:
   - Blooms persist for weeks-months after nutrient input (controlled by bloom_decay)
   - Allows recruitment pulses to lag environmental forcing
   - Multi-year favorable conditions create sustained high blooms → sustained high recruitment

PARAMETERS ADDED:
- log_bloom_response: sensitivity of phytoplankton to nutrient input (year⁻¹)
- log_bloom_decay: decay rate of phytoplankton blooms (year⁻¹)
- log_bloom_amplification: maximum amplification of larval survival by blooms (dimensionless)
- log_bloom_half_sat: half-saturation constant for bloom effect (bloom units)
- log_larval_survival_base: baseline survival without bloom enhancement (dimensionless)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
Currently using SST as proxy for wet season nutrient conditions (Gaussian centered at 26.5°C representing cooler wet season temperatures). This maintains model functionality while establishing the bloom dynamics framework. When rainfall/runoff data becomes available, the nutrient proxy can be easily replaced with direct rainfall forcing by changing one line in the bloom growth equation.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Better capture episodic outbreak triggers through temporal bloom dynamics
- More realistic lag between environmental forcing and recruitment response
- Threshold behavior: sustained favorable conditions → large blooms → outbreak-level recruitment
- Improved prediction of outbreak timing and magnitude
- Framework ready for direct rainfall forcing when data becomes available

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events" by adding explicit bloom dynamics that integrate environmental forcing over time, creating the episodic recruitment pulses that drive COTS boom-bust cycles.
