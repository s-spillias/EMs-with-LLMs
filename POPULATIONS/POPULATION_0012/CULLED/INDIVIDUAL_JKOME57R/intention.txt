Assessment:
After evaluating the model and its residuals, the fit is reasonable but the predation process appears oversimplified. In reality, when COTS are very abundant, interference among individuals can reduce per-individual predation efficiency. To capture this ecological nuance, I have introduced a new parameter "predation_interference" and incorporated it into the predation terms in the coral loss equations. This adjustment makes the outbreak phase less extreme when COTS densities are very high, aligning the model closer with observed boom-bust cycles.
