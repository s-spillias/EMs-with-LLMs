The model reasonably captures boom-bust dynamics of COTS but oversimplifies coral recovery by treating fast-growing and slow-growing corals independently. In real reef ecosystems, both coral types share space, and high overall coral cover (approaching 100%) inhibits additional recovery. 

To improve ecological realism, we introduced a density‐dependent competition factor in the recovery equations. Recovery for both coral groups is now multiplied by (1 – coral_competition_coefficient * (fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / 100) to capture the reduction in recovery as total coral cover increases. The new parameter, coral_competition_coefficient, allows calibration of this effect based on field observations and ecological theory.
