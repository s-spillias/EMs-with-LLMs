After reviewing the residuals and the model behavior, we have found that the current formulation overestimates coral predation during high-density COTS outbreak phases, leading to potential discrepancies in the timing and magnitude of population cycles. An important ecological process—predator interference—is missing, whereby increased COTS density reduces individual predation efficiency due to interference among predators.
To address this, we introduce a new parameter `predator_interference` to capture the reduction in predation rates at high COTS densities. This adjustment provides a more realistic, density-dependent modulation of coral predation, thereby improving the fit and robustness of the model for episodic outbreak dynamics.
