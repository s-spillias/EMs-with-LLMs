Below are the proposed changes. I've chosen to improve the resource‐limitation mechanism by introducing a non‐linear (power‐law) transformation in the saturating function. This change allows the model to more sensitively capture changes in coral cover, thereby better representing thresholds that may trigger COTS outbreaks. An extra parameter,                               
resource_availability_exponent, is added in parameters.json with clear ecological justification.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 The current model captures the basic boom‐bust cycles of COTS outbreaks and their interaction with coral cover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 However, the resource limitation mechanism—implemented as a Michaelis–Menten function—is somewhat oversimplified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 In reality, small changes in coral cover can lead to disproportionately large effects on COTS growth when near a critical threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 To better capture these dynamics, we add a non‐linear exponent to the coral availability function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 This modification, controlled by the new parameter “resource_availability_exponent”, allows for a sharper response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 in COTS growth as coral cover declines, thereby improving the model’s ability to simulate outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.

This change adds the missing resource_availability_exponent parameter declaration so that the model compiles successfully using the new saturating function in the resource limitation mechanism.

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

Below is the revised SEARCH/REPLACE block.
