Assessment:
The current model captures the basic boom‐bust cycles of COTS outbreaks and their interaction with coral cover.
However, the resource limitation mechanism—implemented as a Michaelis–Menten function—is somewhat oversimplified.
In reality, small changes in coral cover can lead to disproportionately large effects on COTS growth when near a critical threshold.
To better capture these dynamics, we add a non‐linear exponent to the coral availability function.
This modification, controlled by the new parameter “resource_availability_exponent”, allows for a sharper response
in COTS growth as coral cover declines, thereby improving the model’s ability to simulate outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
