Assessment:
The current model accurately captures the primary dynamics of COTS outbreaks and the associated coral responses, including recovery and predation. However, it oversimplifies the interspecific interactions between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites spp.) corals competing for limited space. This competition can significantly modulate coral recovery in natural reef systems.
Improvement:
A new parameter "interspecific_competition" (default value 0.1) has been introduced to represent this effect. In the fast-growing coral recovery equation, the available recovery capacity (100 - fast_pred[t-1]) is reduced by interspecific_competition multiplied by slow_pred[t-1], and similarly, the slow-growing coral recovery is reduced by interspecific_competition multiplied by fast_pred[t-1]. This change better reflects the negative feedback of interspecific competition.
Note:
Only previous time step values are used to avoid data leakage.
