Below are the proposed changes. We are introducing an interspecific competition effect between fast- and slow-growing corals to improve the model's realism by capturing competition for limited reef space. This change is justified by ecological observations that when both coral groups are abundant, they inhibit each other’s recovery. We add a new parameter                  
interspecific_competition (default value 0.1) and modify the recovery equations for fast and slow corals to subtract the competitor's contribution. We also update the intention.txt file with our assessment and reasoning.

 The current model captures the outbreak dynamics of COTS and incorporates key ecological interactions such as coral recovery and predation. However, an important process that is oversimplified is the competition for space between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Porites spp.) corals. In natural reef systems, these groups compete for limite 
 space which can further modulate their recovery post-disturbance.

 Introduce an interspecific competition mechanism by adding a new parameter "interspecific_competition" and incorporating it into the coral recovery equations. Specifically, the recovery term for fast-growing corals is reduced by the presence of slow-growing corals, and vice versa. This modification captures the negative feedback due to space limitation and interspecific  
 interactions.

Below are the proposed changes. We are introducing an interspecific competition effect between fast- and slow-growing corals to improve the model's realism by capturing competition for limited reef space. This change is justified by ecological observations that when both coral groups are abundant, they inhibit each other’s recovery. We add a new parameter 
`interspecific_competition` (default value 0.1) and modify the recovery equations for fast and slow corals to subtract the competitor's contribution. We also update the `intention.txt` file with our assessment and reasoning.

 The current model accurately captures the primary dynamics of COTS outbreaks and the associated coral responses, including recovery and predation. However, it oversimplifies the interspecific interactions between fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites spp.) corals competing for limited space. This competition can significantly modulate coral      
 recovery in natural reef systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 A new parameter "interspecific_competition" (default value 0.1) has been introduced to represent this effect. In the fast-growing coral recovery equation, the available recovery capacity (100 - fast_pred[t-1]) is reduced by interspecific_competition multiplied by slow_pred[t-1], and similarly, the slow-growing coral recovery is reduced by interspecific_competition        
 multiplied by fast_pred[t-1]. This change better reflects the negative feedback of interspecific competition.
