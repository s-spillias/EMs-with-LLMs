Below is our plan:                                                                                                                     

 1 In intention.txt we document our assessment and our chosen improvement. We explain that while the existing model captures the       
   general boom-bust cycles of COTS, the outbreak trigger is too simple. By adding a quadratic (nonlinear) term (via a new parameter   
   outbreak_poly), we capture a delayed outbreak initiation until a threshold is reached—better reflecting ecological threshold        
   effects.                                                                                                                            
 2 In parameters.json we add a new parameter outbreak_poly with a small default value and clear ecological reasoning.                  
 3 In model.cpp, we modify the outbreak trigger equation by adding the quadratic term using outbreak_poly (note we only use the        
   previous time step value cots_pred[t-1]).

 =======                                                                                                                               
 Project assessment and proposed improvement:                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                       
 After evaluating the model against observed residuals and the ecological context, the model generally captures the boom-bust cycles o 
 COTS and their predation impact on coral. However, the current outbreak trigger, determined solely by a power-law term (using         
 outbreak_shape), may oversimplify a process that in reality is threshold-dependent. Population build-up might not effectively trigger 
 an outbreak until a critical density is reached.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                       
 Proposed improvement: Introduce a quadratic nonlinearity in the outbreak trigger function by adding a new parameter "outbreak_poly".  
 This parameter allows the outbreak trigger to remain suppressed at low COTS densities and only rapidly amplify once a threshold is    
 exceeded, thereby better capturing the observed delayed outbreak initiation and rapid escalation.                                     
                                                                                                                                       
 This adjustment improves the ecological fidelity by accounting for nuanced, threshold-dependent outbreak dynamics.

After applying these changes you should re-run your model and evaluate how the additional quadratic term improves the prediction of    
outbreak timing and magnitude.
