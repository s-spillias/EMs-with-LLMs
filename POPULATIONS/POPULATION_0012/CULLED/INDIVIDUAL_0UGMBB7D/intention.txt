Project assessment and proposed improvement:

After evaluating the model against observed residuals and the ecological context, the model generally captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS and their predation impact on coral. However, the current outbreak trigger, determined solely by a power-law term (using outbreak_shape), may oversimplify a process that in reality is threshold-dependent. Population build-up might not effectively trigger an outbreak until a critical density is reached.

Proposed improvement: Introduce a quadratic nonlinearity in the outbreak trigger function by adding a new parameter "outbreak_poly". This parameter allows the outbreak trigger to remain suppressed at low COTS densities and only rapidly amplify once a threshold is exceeded, thereby better capturing the observed delayed outbreak initiation and rapid escalation.

This adjustment improves the ecological fidelity by accounting for nuanced, threshold-dependent outbreak dynamics.
