Assessment and Model Improvement:
After evaluating the residuals and overall model fit, it appears that the current linear outbreak trigger does not fully capture the abrupt onset observed during COTS outbreaks. To better represent the sharp, threshold‐like behavior seen in the ecological data, I have introduced a quadratic component in the outbreak trigger function via a new parameter “outbreak_poly”. This parameter adds non-linear curvature to the trigger, representing ecological hysteresis at outbreak initiation. The updated model with this modification should better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreak events.
