Below is my proposal for one meaningful ecological improvement. In summary, we note that residuals indicate that the current outbreak  
trigger (which depends solely on a power‐law of the COTS density) does not capture the “tipping‐point” behavior well. To address this, 
we introduce an additional quadratic term into the outbreak trigger calculation (via a new parameter outbreak_quad) to non‐linearly    
amplify outbreak onset once COTS densities become high. This approach reflects the possibility that slight increases in high-density   
scenarios result in disproportionate ecological feedbacks (e.g. increased competition or behavioral shifts) that trigger rapid         
outbreaks. No current time step data (_dat) are used in predictions.                                                                   

I will update three files accordingly:                                                                                                 

 1 Update intention.txt to document our assessment and reasoning.                                                                      
 2 Update parameters.json to add the new parameter outbreak_quad with ecological justification.                                        
 3 Update model.cpp to include the quadratic term in the outbreak trigger calculation.

 Model Assessment:                                                                                                                     
 The current model captures the boom‐bust dynamics by incorporating logistic growth, resource limitation, and an outbreak trigger.     
 However, residual analysis indicates that the abrupt onset of outbreaks is not well captured.

 A quadratic term is added to the outbreak trigger function to introduce non‐linear amplification at high COTS densities. This reflect 
 ecological processes where high density intensifies competitive and behavioral feedbacks, leading to rapid outbreak transitions.

After applying these changes, you can rebuild the model and check the residuals to verify that the new outbreak trigger improves the   
fit for abrupt outbreak onsets.
