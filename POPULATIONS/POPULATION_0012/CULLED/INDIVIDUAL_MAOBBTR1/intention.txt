Model Assessment:
The current model captures the boom‐bust dynamics by incorporating logistic growth, resource limitation, and an outbreak trigger. However, residual analysis indicates that the abrupt onset of outbreaks is not well captured. 

Improvement:
A quadratic term is added to the outbreak trigger function to introduce non‐linear amplification at high COTS densities. This reflects ecological processes where high density intensifies competitive and behavioral feedbacks, leading to rapid outbreak transitions.
