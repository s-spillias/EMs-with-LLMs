MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model includes core COTS-coral dynamics with Allee effects, density dependence, temperature responses, and Type II functional responses for predation. However, it treats larval recruitment as a simple product of immigration rate, constant survival fraction, and temperature effect.

KEY LIMITATION IDENTIFIED:
The model fails to capture the EPISODIC nature of COTS outbreaks emphasized in the PROJECT CONTEXT. Real outbreaks are triggered by sporadic nutrient pulses (from terrestrial runoff during flood events) that dramatically enhance larval survival and settlement. The current constant larval_survival parameter (0.3) cannot generate the explosive recruitment events that initiate characteristic boom-bust cycles.

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:
Added nutrient-mediated enhancement of larval survival to capture outbreak triggers.

MECHANISM:
- Baseline larval survival remains at the fitted value (larval_survival parameter)
- During favorable conditions (warm, wet periods), survival is enhanced by a nutrient effect
- Using positive SST anomalies as a proxy for warm wet seasons that bring both elevated temperatures and terrestrial runoff
- This creates nonlinear recruitment pulses that trigger outbreaks

NEW PARAMETER ADDED:
- log_nutrient_effect: Log-scale multiplier for nutrient enhancement of larval survival
  * Ecological meaning: Strength of nutrient-driven recruitment enhancement
  * Expected range: 0.0 to 2.0 (1x to 7.4x enhancement)
  * This allows sporadic high-recruitment events while maintaining baseline recruitment otherwise

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Modified EQUATION 10 (larval recruitment) to include:
1. Calculate SST anomaly relative to COTS optimal temperature
2. Apply threshold function: only positive anomalies (warm conditions) enhance survival
3. Nutrient effect = exp(nutrient_effect_strength * positive_anomaly)
4. Enhanced recruitment = base_survival * nutrient_effect * immigration * temp_effect

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOME:
- During normal conditions: recruitment follows baseline patterns
- During warm, wet periods: recruitment spikes create outbreak initiation
- This generates the episodic boom-bust dynamics central to the PROJECT CONTEXT
- Better captures the timing and magnitude of population explosions
- Maintains mechanistic link between environmental drivers and outbreak triggers

PARAMETER VALUE CONSIDERATIONS:
The updated temp_opt_cots value (28.5Â°C with tight bounds) from literature suggests refined understanding of thermal optima. The new nutrient effect parameter works synergistically with this - warm conditions near the optimum coincide with wet season runoff, creating the compound effect that triggers outbreaks.
