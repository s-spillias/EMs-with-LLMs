Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model provides a good baseline for capturing COTS outbreak cycles, yet the residuals indicate that outbreaks may not be optimally timed.
2. The model addresses boom-bust dynamics and incorporates resource limitation via coral availability; however, it oversimplifies the feedback between coral abundance and outbreak onset.
3. To better capture the system dynamics, we introduce an ecological feedback mechanism where high coral cover lowers the outbreak threshold. This represents the idea that abundant coral (food) can facilitate an earlier outbreak.
4. We add the new parameter "outbreak_feedback" to quantify this effect. In the outbreak trigger calculation, an additional term (outbreak_feedback * (total coral cover â€“ 100)) is subtracted from the outbreak threshold.
5. This higher-order modification helps to capture the non-linear feedback between coral cover and outbreak dynamics, aligning with observed data and the ecological context.
