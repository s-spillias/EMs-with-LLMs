Below are the proposed changes. We are proposing to capture a potential missing ecological feedback: the effect of coral cover on      
reducing the threshold for outbreak onset. This adds a new parameter, outbreak_feedback, that adjusts the outbreak trigger in the      
model. Ecologically, when coral cover is high the available food can lower the outbreak threshold and trigger outbreaks earlier. This  
change is justified by the ecological context and the residuals analysis showing subtle biases in outbreak timing. We also update the  
intention file with our assessment and reasoning.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                 
 1. The current model provides a good baseline for capturing COTS outbreak cycles, yet the residuals indicate that outbreaks may not b 
 optimally timed.                                                                                                                      
 2. The model addresses boom-bust dynamics and incorporates resource limitation via coral availability; however, it oversimplifies the 
 feedback between coral abundance and outbreak onset.                                                                                  
 3. To better capture the system dynamics, we introduce an ecological feedback mechanism where high coral cover lowers the outbreak    
 threshold. This represents the idea that abundant coral (food) can facilitate an earlier outbreak.                                    
 4. We add the new parameter "outbreak_feedback" to quantify this effect. In the outbreak trigger calculation, an additional term      
 (outbreak_feedback * (total coral cover – 100)) is subtracted from the outbreak threshold.                                            
 5. This higher-order modification helps to capture the non-linear feedback between coral cover and outbreak dynamics, aligning with   
 observed data and the ecological context.

Below is a SEARCH/REPLACE block for POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_4KPAL13T/model.cpp that clamps the COTS prediction value in 
the outbreak trigger calculation. This prevents negative or near-zero values from causing invalid results in the pow() call.

Below is the SEARCH/REPLACE block that clamps the COTS prediction used in the outbreak decline calculation. This ensures that when the 
outbreak_decline_exponent is negative (as observed in phase 2), we do not pass a zero value to the power function, which can yield NaN 
values.
