Assessment:
The current model adequately simulates key processes in the COTS outbreak - coral dynamics interaction but uses a simple logistic function for the outbreak trigger. The residuals indicate that the transition to outbreak conditions is smoother than observed in nature. To better capture the rapid onset of outbreaks, we introduce a non-linear scaling of the difference (delta) between COTS population and threshold via a new parameter, "outbreak_threshold_exponent." With values > 1, this parameter produces a sharper transition in the outbreak trigger, improving model fit to the characteristic boom-bust cycles while remaining ecologically interpretable.
