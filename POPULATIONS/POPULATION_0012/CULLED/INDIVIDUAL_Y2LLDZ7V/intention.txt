Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
-------------------------------------
The current model captures the dynamics of COTS outbreaks using a logistic growth formulation and a smooth logistic outbreak trigger function. However, residual analysis suggests the model underfits high-density transitions. This indicates that the outbreak initiation phase is oversimplified.

To address this, we introduce a cubic term in the outbreak trigger function. The new parameter "outbreak_cubic_coeff" adds extra non-linearity, enabling a sharper transition once the COTS density surpasses the critical threshold. Ecologically, this represents the rapid feedback and threshold dynamics observed during outbreak events.

Changes:
- Added new parameter "outbreak_cubic_coeff" in parameters.json with ecological justification.
- Modified the outbreak trigger function in model.cpp to include the cubic term.
