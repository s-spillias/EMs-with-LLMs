Below is our proposed ecological improvement and the corresponding changes:                                                            

Ecological assessment and improvement:                                                                                                 
Our evaluation of the current model indicates that while it captures the basic boom‐bust dynamics via a logistic‐growth term and a     
smooth logistic outbreak trigger function, the outbreak initiation phase appears slightly oversimplified. Residual diagnostics suggest 
that the transition from low to outbreak density is under‐fitted. In a complex system like this one, additional non-linearity in the   
outbreak trigger could help capture abrupt transitions better. Therefore, we propose adding a higher-order (cubic) term to the outbreak
trigger function. Ecologically, a cubic term allows a more nuanced representation of threshold dynamics, enabling the model to abruptly
transition to outbreak levels once a critical COTS density is exceeded. We add a new parameter, outbreak_cubic_coeff, with an initial  
value of 0.0 (allowing calibration later).

 Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:                                                                                                 
 -------------------------------------                                                                                                 
 The current model captures the dynamics of COTS outbreaks using a logistic growth formulation and a smooth logistic outbreak trigger  
 function. However, residual analysis suggests the model underfits high-density transitions. This indicates that the outbreak initiati 
 phase is oversimplified.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, we introduce a cubic term in the outbreak trigger function. The new parameter "outbreak_cubic_coeff" adds extra      
 non-linearity, enabling a sharper transition once the COTS density surpasses the critical threshold. Ecologically, this represents th 
 rapid feedback and threshold dynamics observed during outbreak events.
