Assessment:
The current model uses logistic growth with an outbreak-triggered decline and coral recovery processes that capture boomâ€“bust dynamics of COTS populations and their impact on coral cover. 
However, the outbreak trigger is implemented as a linear-threshold function of COTS density. In natural systems, the initiation of outbreaks is often highly non-linear due to emergent feedbacks and threshold effects. 
To improve ecological realism and better capture the abrupt transition into outbreak conditions, I propose adding a non-linear exponent (trigger_exponent) to the outbreak trigger. This higher-order effect allows the model to flexibly represent the sharp escalation in outbreak probability once a critical threshold is surpassed.
