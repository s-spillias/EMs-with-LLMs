Assessment:
The current model fits the data moderately well but oversimplifies resource limitation aspects. It effectively captures outbreak dynamics via logistic growth modulated by outbreak-triggered decline and coral predation. However, the model neglects an important ecological feedback: the availability of coral resources should modulate COTS growth, preventing unsustainable outbreaks when coral cover is low.

Improvement:
A resource limitation mechanism is introduced in Equation 1 by modifying the growth term. The new factor, calculated as (fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / 200, represents the fraction of available coral cover and adjusts COTS growth accordingly. This ensures that when coral cover is depleted, COTS outbreaks are curtailed, aligning the model with ecological expectations.
