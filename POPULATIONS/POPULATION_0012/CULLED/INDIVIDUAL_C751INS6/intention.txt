Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The residual analysis indicated that the model underestimates predation losses at high COTS densities. While the model structure captures boom‚Äêbust dynamics and selective predation on coral, it omits a key ecological feedback: interference among COTS. In nature, high predator density can lead to interference that reduces per capita predation efficiency. 

To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "cots_interference" (default value 0.3), which scales down the effective predation efficiency at high COTS densities. The effective predation efficiency is computed as:
    effective_eff = coral_predation_efficiency / (1 + cots_interference * cots_pred[t-1] / (carrying_capacity + eps));
This modification is intended to improve model fidelity in reproducing the outbreak decline phase and capture the observed nonlinearity in predation dynamics.
