Assessment: 
The residuals indicate that the model underestimates the effect of coral cover on predation rates at intermediate coral densities. The current quadratic scaling in predation does not fully capture the threshold and saturation dynamics inherent in predator-prey interactions on the reef. 

Improvement: 
We now incorporate the parameter "predation_efficiency_exponent" in the predation terms for both fast- and slow-growing corals. This modification allows the scaling of coral predation efficiency to be non-linearâ€”values >1 yield a sharper, threshold-like response. This better reflects ecological processes such as predator saturation and prey detectability.

Default Change: 
To reflect this ecological behavior, we set the default value of "predation_efficiency_exponent" to 1.5.
