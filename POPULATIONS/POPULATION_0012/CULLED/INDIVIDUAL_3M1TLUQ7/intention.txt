Assessment and Improvement Plan:

1. The current model uses logistic growth with a smooth outbreak-triggered decline driven by outbreak_sharpness and environmental_modifier. While this captures the overall boom-bust cycles, it oversimplifies the intraspecific density effects.
2. Ecologically, at high COTS densities, increased competition and resource limitations can accelerate outbreak dynamics. The current formulation does not account for such non-linear density feedback.
3. To resolve this, we introduce a new parameter "density_feedback" that adds a quadratic density-dependent term to the outbreak trigger. This improvement better represents the accelerating influence of high COTS densities on outbreak initiation.
