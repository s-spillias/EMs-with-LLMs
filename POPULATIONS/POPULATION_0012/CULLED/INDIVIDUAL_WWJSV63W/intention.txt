Assessment and rationale:
The current model effectively simulates COTS outbreak cycles but assumes a constant coral predation efficiency regardless of predator density. Residual analysis suggests an underestimation of coral declines at high COTS levels. To better capture ecological realism, we introduce a saturating predation function. By adding the parameter "predation_half_sat" (the COTS density at which predation efficiency is halved), we allow predation rates to decline with increasing COTS numbers due to interference competition. This adjustment should improve the timing, magnitude, and duration predictions of outbreak events while avoiding the use of current time step data in predictions.
