This update assesses the current model and incorporates a key ecological improvement. 
Assessment:
- The current model reproduces outbreak cycles using logistic growth and a sigmoid outbreak trigger.
- However, it does not account for the resource limitation imposed by available coral cover, which is critical in determining both the magnitude and duration of COTS outbreaks.

Improvement:
- We introduce a resource limitation mechanism by modulating the logistic growth term with the available coral cover.
- A new parameter "coral_availability_effect" is added so that COTS growth is scaled by the factor [1 + coral_availability_effect * ((fast_pred + slow_pred)/100 - 1)]. 
  This formulation ensures that when overall coral cover is high (near 100%), growth remains unchanged, but when coral cover declines, the growth rate is lowered due to limited resources.

This change better captures ecosystem feedback where COTS growth is constrained by the availability of coral prey.
