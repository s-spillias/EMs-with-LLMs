After evaluating the model's fit and the residuals, we observed that while the dynamics capture the boom-bust cycles of COTS reasonably well, the outbreak trigger mechanism is oversimplified. Currently, the trigger depends solely on COTS density. However, ecological theory and field evidence suggest that coral availability plays a significant role in modulating outbreak onset. High coral cover can enhance the food supply, potentially lowering the threshold for outbreak initiation. 

To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "coral_feedback", that scales the effective outbreak threshold based on coral cover (fast and slow-growing coral summed and normalized). This change makes the outbreak trigger more sensitive in high-coral environments, thereby improving the modelâ€™s ability to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks under varying ecological conditions.
