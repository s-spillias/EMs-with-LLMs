Below is our proposed plan and rationale:                                                                                                                                                                              

Assessment & Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                                

 • The current model uses a logistic function for outbreak triggering based solely on the previous COTS abundance compared to a fixed threshold. However, the model already receives sea-surface temperature (SST) data
   (via sst_dat) but it isn’t used. SST is known to influence coral health and COTS outbreak dynamics through environmental stress.                                                                                    
 • To better capture the episodic outbreak events, we introduce an SST modifier on the outbreak threshold. In effect, we calculate an "effective threshold" as:                                                        
   threshold_effective = threshold + sst_effect * (sst_dat(t-1) - 27.0)                                                                                                                                                
   where 27°C is assumed as the baseline ambient temperature. Higher temperatures increase the risk of outbreak.                                                                                                       
 • This improvement adds an ecologically justified mechanism to account for indirect environmental stressors that facilitate outbreak events without using current time step response values.

 1. Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    - The current model captures boom-bust dynamics of COTS by using a logistic outbreak trigger based solely on previous COTS abundance.                                                                              
    - However, the model ignores available environmental information (sst_dat) which is known to affect coral stress and outbreak likelihood.                                                                          
    - Residuals indicate potential misfits during periods of anomalous sea-surface temperatures.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 2. Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                
    - Introduce an environmental modifier to adjust the outbreak threshold based on SST anomalies.                                                                                                                     
    - New effective threshold: threshold_effective = threshold + sst_effect*(sst_dat(t-1) - 27.0)                                                                                                                      
      (Assuming 27°C as the baseline ambient SST.)                                                                                                                                                                     
    - This change reflects ecologically plausible dynamics where higher temperatures predispose the system to outbreaks.
