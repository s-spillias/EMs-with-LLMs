Project Assessment and Improvement:

1. Assessment:
   - The current model captures boom-bust dynamics of COTS by using a logistic outbreak trigger based solely on previous COTS abundance.
   - However, the model ignores available environmental information (sst_dat) which is known to affect coral stress and outbreak likelihood.
   - Residuals indicate potential misfits during periods of anomalous sea-surface temperatures.

2. Chosen Improvement:
   - Introduce an environmental modifier to adjust the outbreak threshold based on SST anomalies.
   - New effective threshold: threshold_effective = threshold + sst_effect*(sst_dat(t-1) - 27.0)
     (Assuming 27Â°C as the baseline ambient SST.)
   - This change reflects ecologically plausible dynamics where higher temperatures predispose the system to outbreaks.

3. Expected Benefit:
   - Better fits to the data by capturing environmental stress influences on outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
