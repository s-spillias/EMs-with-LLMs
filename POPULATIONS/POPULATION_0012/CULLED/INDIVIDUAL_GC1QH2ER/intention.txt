Assessment:
The current model captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their predation on coral communities. However, the saturating resource limitation effect based on coral availability appears to underrepresent observed non‐linear responses. To better capture these dynamics—such as threshold effects and competition—we introduce a quadratic term to the resource limitation factor. This refinement uses only lagged values to avoid data leakage.
