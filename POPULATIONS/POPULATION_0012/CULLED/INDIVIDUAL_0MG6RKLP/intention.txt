Assessment and Improvement:
---------------------------
The current model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of Crown-of-Thorns starfish, but the outbreak trigger is implemented using a linear threshold function. This can oversimplify the sharp transition observed in real ecological systems.
To address the project context, we propose modifying the outbreak trigger to use a quadratic function of the normalized COTS density. This adjustment better reflects the intrinsic non-linear dynamics whereby the outbreak becomes explosive only when the COTS density (relative to carrying capacity) crosses a threshold (~50%). This change is ecologically justified as it captures a more realistic, threshold-dependent outbreak onset mechanism.
