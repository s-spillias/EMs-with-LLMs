   We will update the empty intention file with our assessment. We explain that while the current model reasonably recovers boom‐bust cycles, the outbreak trigger was oversimplified. By introducing a quadratic      
   (polynomial) term through a normalized (relative density) formulation, the model more sharply captures the threshold-like outbreak onset, which is ecologically plausible.                                          
 2 parameters.json                                                                                                                                                                                                     
   We update the description of the outbreak_sharpness parameter to note that it now governs the steepness in a quadratic outbreak trigger function based on normalized COTS density.                                  
 3 model.cpp                                                                                                                                                                                                           
   We modify the outbreak trigger calculation. Instead of using a linear threshold on the raw COTS population, the updated code normalizes the COTS population by its carrying capacity and then uses the squared value
   in the exponential function. This guarantees that reproduction of the outbreak trigger uses solely information from the previous time step and provides a sharper non-linear switch when the population exceeds 50% 
   of the carrying capacity (since 0.5² = 0.25).

 The current model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of Crown-of-Thorns starfish, but the outbreak trigger is implemented using a linear threshold function. This can oversimplify the sharp transition     
 observed in real ecological systems.                                                                                                                                                                                  
 To address the project context, we propose modifying the outbreak trigger to use a quadratic function of the normalized COTS density. This adjustment better reflects the intrinsic non-linear dynamics whereby the   
 outbreak becomes explosive only when the COTS density (relative to carrying capacity) crosses a threshold (~50%). This change is ecologically justified as it captures a more realistic, threshold-dependent outbreak 
 onset mechanism.

After applying these changes, you can run your model to examine if the quadratic outbreak trigger improves the fit relative to the observed boom-bust dynamics.
