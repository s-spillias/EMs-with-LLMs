Model Intention:
1. Simulate episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
2. Capture boom-bust cycles: rapid population increases (outbreaks) followed by declines.
3. Model incorporates logistic growth for COTS modulated by predation from coral.
4. Coral components include fast-growing Acropora (rapidly changing) and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites (more stable).
5. Ecological processes include multiple forms of resource limitation, environmental modifications, and feedback loops.
6. Numerical stability is ensured with small constants and smooth transitions.
7. Likelihood calculation uses lognormal observation models, leveraging all observed data without data leakage.
