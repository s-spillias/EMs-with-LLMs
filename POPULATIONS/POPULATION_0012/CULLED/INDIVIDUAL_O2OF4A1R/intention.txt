Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model captures key outbreak dynamics of COTS and its predation on coral, but it overlooks an important ecological feedback: the influence of prey (coral) availability on predator (COTS) growth. Ecologically, higher coral cover can fuel increased reproduction and outbreak intensity, while a depleted coral community could constrain growth. To address this, a new parameter ('cots_growth_coral_influence') has been introduced and incorporated into the COTS logistic growth formulation by modulating it with a normalized coral cover factor. This improvement should better capture the boom-bust cycles observed in COTS dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef.
