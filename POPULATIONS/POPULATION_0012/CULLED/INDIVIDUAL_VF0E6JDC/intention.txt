Assessment:
The current model effectively captures outbreak dynamics through resource limitation and outbreak trigger mechanisms. However, our evaluation of the residuals indicates that the timing and magnitude of the COTS outbreak may be further refined by including a delayed density‐dependent feedback. In reef systems, biological responses (e.g. recovery and predation responses) often lag behind changes in population sizes. The introduced lag_feedback parameter will modulate growth based on the difference between the current (t–1) and the previous (t–2) COTS predictions, thereby capturing ecological inertia and improving outbreak predictions.
