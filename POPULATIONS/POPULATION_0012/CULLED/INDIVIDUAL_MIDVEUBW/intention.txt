Assessment:
The current model uses logistic growth for COTS with an outbreak-triggered decline based only on COTS density relative to the carrying capacity. However, it does not explicitly incorporate the availability of coral resources, which are key for fueling outbreak dynamics. Analysis of the residuals indicates systematic deviations that may stem from this omission.

Chosen Improvement:
We now include an ecological feedback mechanism by incorporating fast-growing coral cover into the outbreak trigger threshold. A new parameter, "coral_dependency," is introduced to quantify how coral availability modulates the outbreak initiation. Ecologically, abundant coral lowers the threshold for an outbreak because it provides essential resources to support COTS proliferation.
