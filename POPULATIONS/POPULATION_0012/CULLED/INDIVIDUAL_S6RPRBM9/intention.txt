Assessment:
1. The current model captures the general boom‚Äêbust dynamics but underestimates the abruptness of outbreak onsets.
2. Residuals indicate a smoother outbreak trigger than observed ecologically.
3. Improvement: Introduce a higher-order non-linear response in the outbreak trigger by squaring the exponent terms. This change better represents the threshold behavior in COTS outbreaks, improving predictions of timing, magnitude, and duration.
