MODEL IMPROVEMENT ASSESSMENT:
The residual analysis indicates that the current model underestimates the rapid onset of COTS outbreaks. In nature, once a threshold is crossed, outbreak dynamics can change dramatically. 
To capture this effect, we introduce a higher-order outbreak trigger via the new trigger_exponent parameter. The parameter refines the outbreak onset by amplifying small differences once the COTS population nears the threshold (i.e. 50% of carrying capacity). This added non-linear sensitivity is ecologically justified and should improve the modelâ€™s accuracy in predicting outbreak timing and magnitude.
