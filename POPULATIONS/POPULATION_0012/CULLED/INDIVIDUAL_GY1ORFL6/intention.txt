Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:

The current model uses a fixed maximum coral cover of 100% for both fast- and slow-growing coral recovery. This may oversimplify the resource limitation dynamics inherent in coral ecosystems, where available space and resource competition vary spatially and temporally. Residual analysis indicates that this simplification may cause discrepancies between observed and predicted values. 

To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "coral_carrying_capacity", that will represent the maximum sustainable coral cover. This change allows the model to more flexibly capture resource limitation and competition among coral species, providing a better ecological representation of the system dynamics.
