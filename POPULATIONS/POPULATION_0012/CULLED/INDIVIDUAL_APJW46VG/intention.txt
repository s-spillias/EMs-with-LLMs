Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
--------------------------------------
Current evaluation indicates that although the model captures the basic outbreak dynamics 
and predation effects on coral communities, the resource limitation component is oversimplified. 
The current linear scaling of COTS growth by (total_coral / max_coral_cover) does not account 
for saturation effects. 

Proposed Improvement:
---------------------
Incorporate a saturating (Michaelisâ€“Menten type) function into the COTS growth equation:
    total_coral / (half_saturation_coral + total_coral)

This captures the ecological reality that additional coral cover beyond a certain point has 
diminishing effects on resource availability for COTS. A new parameter "half_saturation_coral" 
will be introduced to represent the coral cover at which the growth reaches half its maximum 
potential. This modification will help improve the timing, magnitude, and duration predictions 
of the outbreak events while maintaining ecological realism.
