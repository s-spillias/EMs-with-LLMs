Update: Assessment and improvement for outbreak dynamics.

Assessment:
- The current model simulates COTS populations using logistic growth and a trigger function for outbreaks.
- Residual analysis indicates that the model underestimates the feedback effect arising from reductions in coral cover.
- Ecologically, lower coral cover can amplify outbreak dynamics by diminishing refugia or altering predation dynamics.

Improvement:
- Introduce an indirect feedback mechanism via a new parameter, "coral_feedback_strength". When average coral cover is low, the outbreak trigger is sharpened, better capturing the observed rapid onset and collapse seen in outbreak events.
