Below is an outline of the changes, along with our SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. In summary, we noted that the residuals and ecological       
reasoning suggest that the current outbreak trigger is not sensitive enough to reduced coral cover. To improve model realism we add an 
indirect feedback mechanism where lower average coral cover increases outbreak trigger steepness via a new parameter,                  
coral_feedback_strength. This additional term reflects that degraded coral conditions may further favor rapid COTS outbreak dynamics.  
We document this in intention.txt, add the new parameter in parameters.json, and update the calculation in model.cpp.

 Update: Assessment and improvement for outbreak dynamics.

 - The current model simulates COTS populations using logistic growth and a trigger function for outbreaks.                            
 - Residual analysis indicates that the model underestimates the feedback effect arising from reductions in coral cover.               
 - Ecologically, lower coral cover can amplify outbreak dynamics by diminishing refugia or altering predation dynamics.                
                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement:                                                                                                                          
 - Introduce an indirect feedback mechanism via a new parameter, "coral_feedback_strength". When average coral cover is low, the       
 outbreak trigger is sharpened, better capturing the observed rapid onset and collapse seen in outbreak events.

Once these changes are applied, the model will better capture the ecological feedback mechanisms driving COTS outbreak dynamics.

Below is the SEARCH/REPLACE block to fix the compilation error by declaring the coral_feedback_strength parameter in model.cpp. This   
block adds the missing parameter declaration after the existing extreme_outbreak_modifier declaration.
