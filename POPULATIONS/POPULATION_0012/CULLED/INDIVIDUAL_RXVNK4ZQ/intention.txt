Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) Outbreak Model with Coral Community Dynamics

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) on the Great Barrier Reef and their impacts on coral communities. The model captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations and their selective predation on different coral functional groups.

ECOLOGICAL COMPONENTS:

1. COTS Population Dynamics:
   - Larval immigration from external sources (episodic recruitment events)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival and settlement success
   - Density-dependent recruitment (Allee effects at low densities, competition at high densities)
   - Adult mortality (baseline + density-dependent starvation)
   - Maturation from juveniles to adults

2. Coral Community Dynamics:
   - Fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.): High growth rates, high susceptibility to COTS predation
   - Slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites spp.): Lower growth rates, moderate susceptibility to COTS predation
   - Logistic growth with carrying capacity
   - Competition for space between coral groups
   - COTS selective predation with Type II functional response

3. Environmental Forcing:
   - Sea surface temperature effects on COTS larval survival
   - Temperature-dependent coral growth rates
   - Larval immigration pulses (external forcing)

KEY MECHANISMS FOR OUTBREAK DYNAMICS:

1. Outbreak Triggers:
   - Episodic larval immigration events combined with favorable temperature conditions
   - Allee effects allow rapid population growth once threshold density is exceeded
   - Abundant coral prey (especially fast-growing Acropora) supports population expansion

2. Outbreak Maintenance:
   - High coral availability sustains high COTS densities
   - Temperature-mediated recruitment success
   - Density-dependent feedbacks regulate population growth

3. Population Collapse:
   - Coral depletion leads to starvation-induced mortality
   - Reduced recruitment as food becomes limiting
   - Return to low baseline densities

The model uses a discrete-time framework with annual time steps, matching the temporal resolution of monitoring data. Predictions are made using lognormal likelihoods to account for the highly skewed nature of COTS abundance and coral cover data.
