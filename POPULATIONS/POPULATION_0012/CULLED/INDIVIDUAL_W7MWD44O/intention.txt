Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model captures COTS boom‐bust cycles and coral dynamics but oversimplifies the resource limitation on COTS growth.
2. The modification adds a new parameter (resource_limitation_exponent) to allow a non‐linear scaling of coral availability.
3. Ecologically, this makes sense because lower coral availability may lead to a disproportionately stronger reduction in COTS growth due to limited resources.
4. This higher-order representation refines the saturating function in the growth equation, helping the model better capture outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
