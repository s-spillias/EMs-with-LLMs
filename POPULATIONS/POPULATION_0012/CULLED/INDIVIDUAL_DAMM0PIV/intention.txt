Assessment:
- The residuals indicate that while the model captures general outbreak dynamics, the influence of fast-growing coral on triggering outbreaks is overly linear.
- Ecologically, the effect of additional coral cover tends to saturate; beyond a certain threshold, extra coral cover does not proportionally increase outbreak propensity.
- Chosen improvement: incorporate a saturating (Michaelisâ€“Menten type) response by introducing a new parameter (fast_coral_half) to serve as the half-saturation constant. This captures resource limitation more realistically.
- All calculations continue to use only the previous time step values, thereby avoiding data leakage.
