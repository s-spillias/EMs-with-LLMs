PROJECT ASSESSMENT AND MODEL IMPROVEMENT:
Assessment:
1. The current model effectively captures COTS outbreak dynamics using logistic growth modulated by a smooth outbreak trigger and coral decline through predation. However, it does not account for the resource limitation imposed by coral prey availability.
2. Specifically, when fast-growing coral cover is depleted, the reproductive potential of COTS should be reduced. This ecological feedback is missing.
3. Incorporating a resource limitation mechanism that scales COTS growth by the normalized fast-growing coral cover will improve the ecological realism of the model.

Chosen Improvement:
- Introduce a new parameter "prey_availability_effect" that exerts a scaling (non-linear) influence on COTS growth based on the previous time stepâ€™s fast-growing coral cover. This captures the idea that limited coral prey constrains COTS reproduction.
