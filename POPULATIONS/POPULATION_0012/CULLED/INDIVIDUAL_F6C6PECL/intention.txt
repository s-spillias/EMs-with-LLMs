MODEL ASSESSMENT:

The current model attempts to capture COTS outbreak dynamics through two mechanisms acting on larval immigration:
1. Nutrient-mediated enhancement (using SST anomaly as proxy)
2. Density-dependent fecundity enhancement

IDENTIFIED ISSUES:

1. Ecological Inconsistency: The density-dependent fecundity mechanism (Equation 1c) operates on IMMIGRATION, not local reproduction. This is ecologically problematic because:
   - Fecundity affects egg/sperm production by local adults
   - Immigration represents larvae arriving from external sources
   - Applying local density-dependent fecundity to external immigrants confounds spatial processes

2. Missing Critical Process: The model lacks explicit LOCAL REPRODUCTION from resident COTS. All recruitment comes from immigration. Real outbreaks involve:
   - Primary outbreaks: favorable conditions enhance settlement of external larvae
   - Secondary outbreaks: local reproduction during high-density phases sustains populations

3. Mechanistic Redundancy: Two separate enhancement mechanisms on the same pathway (immigration) may create unrealistic positive feedbacks.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:

Add explicit local larval production with density-dependent fertilization success, creating two distinct recruitment pathways:

PATHWAY 1 - Immigration (Primary Outbreaks):
- External larvae arrive (cotsimm_dat)
- Modified by temperature suitability
- Modified by baseline larval survival
- Simplified: removed nutrient enhancement (confounded with temperature)

PATHWAY 2 - Local Reproduction (Secondary Outbreaks):
- Local adults produce larvae
- Per-capita fecundity increases with density (broadcast spawner fertilization success)
- Hill function captures threshold for successful fertilization
- Creates self-sustaining outbreaks once density threshold reached

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:

1. Broadcast Spawning Biology: COTS release gametes into water column. Fertilization success is strongly density-dependent due to:
   - Sperm dilution at low density
   - Synchronous spawning aggregations at high density
   - This creates a reproductive Allee effect distinct from survival Allee effects

2. Outbreak Dynamics: This dual-pathway structure better captures the PROJECT CONTEXT requirements:
   - TRIGGER: Immigration during favorable environmental conditions initiates population increase
   - SUSTAIN: Once density threshold reached, local reproduction takes over, sustaining outbreak
   - BOOM: Positive feedback from density-dependent fertilization accelerates growth
   - BUST: Food depletion eventually causes crash despite high reproductive potential

3. Spatial Realism: Separates external connectivity (immigration) from local demography (reproduction), allowing the model to distinguish between:
   - Reefs that receive larvae but can't sustain outbreaks (low local reproduction)
   - Reefs that develop self-sustaining outbreaks (high local reproduction)

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

New parameter: log_local_fecundity (baseline per-capita larval production rate)
Modified parameters: Repurposed existing fecundity parameters for local reproduction
- log_max_fecundity_boost: now applies to LOCAL reproduction
- log_fecundity_halfsat: density threshold for fertilization success
- fecundity_exponent: Hill coefficient for fertilization response

Removed: log_nutrient_effect (confounded with temperature, ecologically unclear)

New Equation Structure:
Local_reproduction = local_fecundity * COTS(t-1) * fertilization_success(COTS(t-1)) * temp_effect
where fertilization_success uses Hill function with existing parameters

This creates mechanistically distinct and ecologically realistic recruitment pathways that better capture the boom-bust dynamics central to the PROJECT CONTEXT.
