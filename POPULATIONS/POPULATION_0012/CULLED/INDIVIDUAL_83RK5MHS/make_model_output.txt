 Based on residual analysis, the model tends to overestimate COTS persistence after outbreak peaks, suggesting that density‐dependent mortality due to resource limitation is under‐represented. To address this, I ha 
 incorporated a quadratic density‐dependent (intraspecific competition) term into the COTS dynamics. This change captures the ecological reality that very high COTS densities lead to increased mortality from        
 competition for limited resources, thereby better reflecting the observed boom‐bust cycles.
