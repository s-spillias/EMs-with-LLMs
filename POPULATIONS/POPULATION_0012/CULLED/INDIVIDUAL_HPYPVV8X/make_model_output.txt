Below is our proposed plan and associated changes:                                                                                     

Assessment & Improvement Rationale (to be added to intention.txt):                                                                     

 • The current model fits data reasonably well regarding the outbreak dynamics and predation‐related decline of COTS. However, one key 
   ecological process that is oversimplified is the competition for limited substrate among coral species. In natural reef systems,    
   both fast‑ and slow‑growing corals compete for space, which limits recovery rates when overall coral cover is high.                 
 • Improvement: We introduce a new parameter, coral_competition_factor, that diminishes the coral recovery rate through a              
   multiplicative recovery factor (using an exponential decay function) applied to both coral recovery equations. This change creates a
   density‐dependent reduction in coral recovery as the combined coral cover increases, thereby better capturing both the timing and   
   duration of outbreak events.                                                                                                        

Implementation Changes:

 2 parameters.json: Append a new parameter definition for coral_competition_factor with ecological justification.                      
 3 model.cpp:                                                                                                                          
    • In both the fast‑ and slow‑coral recovery equations, multiply the recovery term by an exponential factor:                        
      exp(- coral_competition_factor * (fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / Type(100))                                                  
    • This ensures that as combined coral cover increases, recovery is dampened in a realistic, density‐dependent manner.              
    • (Note: All predictions use only previous time step values to avoid data leakage.)

 =======                                                                                                                               
 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 - The current model captures key outbreak dynamics of COTS with a mechanistic depiction of growth, outbreak trigger, predation, and   
 decline.                                                                                                                              
 - However, it does not explicitly account for competition among coral species for limited space. In real reef systems, fast‑ and      
 slow‑growing corals compete for substrate, which can reduce their recovery rates.                                                     
 - Improvement: Introduce a new parameter "coral_competition_factor". Its effect is incorporated by damping coral recovery             
 proportionally to the combined coral cover, via an exponential decay term. This density‐dependent mechanism improves the model’s      
 ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
