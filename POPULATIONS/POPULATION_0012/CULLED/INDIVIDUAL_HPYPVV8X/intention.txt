Assessment:
- The current model captures key outbreak dynamics of COTS with a mechanistic depiction of growth, outbreak trigger, predation, and decline.
- However, it does not explicitly account for competition among coral species for limited space. In real reef systems, fast‑ and slow‑growing corals compete for substrate, which can reduce their recovery rates.
- Improvement: Introduce a new parameter "coral_competition_factor". Its effect is incorporated by damping coral recovery proportionally to the combined coral cover, via an exponential decay term. This density‐dependent mechanism improves the model’s ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
