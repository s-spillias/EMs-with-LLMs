Assessment:
The current model generally captures the boom–bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks but exhibits residual patterns that suggest a missing influence from short‐term environmental variability. In particular, there is evidence that transient fluctuations (e.g. temperature anomalies, nutrient pulses) alter the sensitivity of outbreak triggers. To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "env_variability", which modulates the effective outbreak trigger steepness. This enhancement provides an ecologically plausible mechanism to capture transient external influences on outbreak initiation and decline without compromising the use of only lagged state variables.
