Assessment: The current model successfully captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS and accounts for coral predation. However, it lacks a feedback mechanism whereby the presence of fast-growing coral (Acropora spp.) supports outbreak sustainability by providing food resources. When coral cover is low, outbreaks may not be sustained. To address this, we introduce a feedback mechanism by incorporating fast-growing coral cover in the outbreak_trigger calculation. A new parameter, 'coral_influence', is added to modulate this effect, thus aligning the model more closely with observed ecosystem dynamics.
