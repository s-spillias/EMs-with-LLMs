MODEL IMPROVEMENT ASSESSMENT:
After evaluating the current model and its residuals, it appears that although the logistic growth framework captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS, the outbreak trigger is oversimplified. The model did not account for the role of coral cover in sustaining outbreaks. Ecologically, abundant coral can facilitate larger outbreaks by providing ample food, while diminished coral cover may help curb outbreak severity. 

To better reflect these dynamics, the outbreak trigger has been modified by incorporating a normalized combined coral cover term computed from the previous time stepâ€™s fast- and slow-growing coral predictions. This change ensures that outbreak dynamics are modulated by the available coral prey, aligning with known coral-starfish feedback mechanisms.
