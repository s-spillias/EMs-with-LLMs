Below is a summary of the ecological assessment and proposed improvement followed by the changes to three files.                       

Assessment and Chosen Improvement                                                                                                      

 • Assessment: The residuals indicate that while the current model fairly captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS, it oversimplifies   
   the ecological feedback between coral availability and outbreak trigger sensitivity. In nature, abundant coral not only provides a  
   sustained food source but may also exacerbate the outbreak trigger. Conversely, low coral cover can dampen the potential for an     
   outbreak.                                                                                                                           
 • Improvement: To better represent this indirect feedback mechanism, we introduce a new parameter, trigger_coral_sensitivity. This    
   parameter scales the effect of the combined fast- and slow-growing coral cover on the effective outbreak trigger sharpness. In the  
   model, we adjust the outbreak trigger calculation so that the effective sharpness becomes a function of both environmental modifiers
   and a saturating function of coral cover (computed from the previous time step predictions). This change is ecologically justified, 
   as it recognizes that outbreak dynamics are indirectly regulated by the health of the coral ecosystem.

 Based on the residuals, the model fits the data reasonably well but exhibits systematic deviations suggesting that the outbreak trigg 
 is oversimplified.

 We recognize that abundant coral cover can amplify the outbreak trigger for COTS while low coral cover may suppress it. To capture th 
 indirect ecological feedback, we introduce the parameter "trigger_coral_sensitivity". This parameter scales the effect of combined    
 fast- and slow-growing coral cover (from previous predictions) on the effective outbreak trigger sharpness. This adjustment aligns wi 
 ecological expectations by linking coral ecosystem status with outbreak potential.
