[Assessment]
Based on the residuals, the model fits the data reasonably well but exhibits systematic deviations suggesting that the outbreak trigger is oversimplified.

[Improvement]
We recognize that abundant coral cover can amplify the outbreak trigger for COTS while low coral cover may suppress it. To capture this indirect ecological feedback, we introduce the parameter "trigger_coral_sensitivity". This parameter scales the effect of combined fast- and slow-growing coral cover (from previous predictions) on the effective outbreak trigger sharpness. This adjustment aligns with ecological expectations by linking coral ecosystem status with outbreak potential.
