Assessment:
The current model captures key dynamics but underestimates the rapid decline of COTS during outbreak busts when coral cover collapses.
Improvement:
Introduce the new parameter "coral_depletion_modifier" to amplify the outbreak decline rate when coral availability is low.
Rationale:
As coral becomes depleted, food limitations force a steeper decline in COTS numbers, which better represents the observed boom-bust cycles.
