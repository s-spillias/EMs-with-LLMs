Below is a summary of the proposed changes and their ecological rationale:                                                             

 1 intention.txt:                                                                                                                      
   We add a detailed assessment and reasoning that the current model does not explicitly account for the accelerated decline in COTS   
   populations due to coral depletion. This modification introduces a feedback parameter, coral_depletion_modifier, which amplifies the
   outbreak decline when coral availability is low. This change is ecologically justified because when prey (coral) is scarce, we      
   expect a steeper decline in COTS numbers.

   We add a new parameter named coral_depletion_modifier with a clear description and ecological justification.                        
 3 model.cpp:                                                                                                                          
   a. We add a new parameter declaration for coral_depletion_modifier in the parameters section.                                       
   b. In the COTS dynamics equation, we modify the outbreak decline term by multiplying by a feedback term:                            
   (1 + coral_depletion_modifier × (1 - coral_availability))                                                                           
   so that when coral availability (a measure based on the sum of fast and slow coral cover) is low, the decline in COTS is stronger.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 The current model captures key dynamics of outbreak growth and coral predation; however, the residuals indicate that the downturn pha 
 of COTS outbreaks is not as steep as observed. One potential ecological oversight is the lack of an explicit feedback mechanism where 
 collapsing coral populations (the prey) lead to a more rapid decline in COTS numbers.                                                 
 Improvement:                                                                                                                          
 We introduce a new parameter, "coral_depletion_modifier", to modulate the outbreak decline rate. Specifically, when coral availabilit 
 is low, the decline in COTS is accelerated. This reflects the ecological reality that depleting food resources (coral cover) hasten   
 predator (COTS) decline, enhancing the realism of the boom-bust cycle.

Below is a summary of the proposed changes and their ecological rationale:

1. **intention.txt:**  
   We add a detailed assessment and reasoning that the current model does not explicitly account for the accelerated decline in COTS 
populations due to coral depletion. This modification introduces a feedback parameter, `coral_depletion_modifier`, which amplifies the 
outbreak decline when coral availability is low. This change is ecologically justified because when prey (coral) is scarce, we expect a
steeper decline in COTS numbers.

2. **parameters.json:**  
   We add a new parameter named `coral_depletion_modifier` with a clear description and ecological justification.

3. **model.cpp:**  
   a. We add a new parameter declaration for `coral_depletion_modifier` in the parameters section.  
   b. In the COTS dynamics equation, we modify the outbreak decline term by multiplying by a feedback term:  
   `(1 + coral_depletion_modifier × (1 - coral_availability))`  
   so that when coral availability (a measure based on the sum of fast and slow coral cover) is low, the decline in COTS is stronger.

 The current model captures key dynamics but underestimates the rapid decline of COTS during outbreak busts when coral cover collapses 
 Improvement:                                                                                                                          
 Introduce the new parameter "coral_depletion_modifier" to amplify the outbreak decline rate when coral availability is low.           
 Rationale:                                                                                                                            
 As coral becomes depleted, food limitations force a steeper decline in COTS numbers, which better represents the observed boom-bust   
 cycles.
