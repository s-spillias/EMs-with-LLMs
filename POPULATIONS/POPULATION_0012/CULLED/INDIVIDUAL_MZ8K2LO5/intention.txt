Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model reasonably fits the data using logistic growth and a smooth outbreak-triggered decline. However, the outbreak trigger function appears oversimplified, potentially underestimating the abrupt nature of COTS outbreak declines observed in reality. By introducing a non-linearity exponent ("outbreak_exponent"), the modified model can capture a sharper threshold behavior as COTS populations exceed a critical level. This additional parameter reflects ecological feedback mechanisms where small changes around the threshold lead to disproportionately intense declines, improving the modelâ€™s ability to predict boom-bust cycles.
