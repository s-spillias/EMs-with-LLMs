Assessment:
1. The current model captures logistic growth and outbreak decline well but relies solely on the immediate past COTS state (t-1) to trigger outbreaks.
2. Such an approach may overlook ecological inertia where past population levels influence outbreak timing and magnitude.
3. To better capture this delayed response, we introduce a memory effect via a new parameter, lag_weight.

Chosen Improvement:
Incorporate a lagged COTS population (weighted average of t-1 and t-2) in the outbreak trigger calculation.
This ecological modification reflects that outbreak dynamics are not instantaneously reactive but are influenced by recent history.
