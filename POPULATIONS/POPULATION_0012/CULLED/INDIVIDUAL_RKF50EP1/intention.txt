Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) Outbreak Model for the Great Barrier Reef

This model simulates the episodic outbreak dynamics of Crown of Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) and their impact on coral communities. The model captures:

1. COTS POPULATION DYNAMICS:
   - Larval immigration as an external forcing mechanism that seeds outbreaks
   - Density-dependent recruitment with Allee effects (cooperation in feeding/survival at intermediate densities)
   - Temperature-dependent larval survival and recruitment success
   - Natural mortality including density-dependent starvation at high densities
   - Boom-bust cycles driven by resource depletion and immigration pulses

2. CORAL COMMUNITY DYNAMICS:
   - Two functional coral groups: fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites)
   - Logistic growth with carrying capacity for each coral type
   - Competitive interactions between coral groups for space
   - Temperature stress effects on coral growth and mortality

3. PREDATION INTERACTIONS:
   - Type II functional response for COTS feeding on corals
   - Preferential feeding on fast-growing Acropora when abundant
   - Switching to slow-growing corals when preferred prey is depleted
   - Feeding rate modulation by total coral availability

4. ENVIRONMENTAL FORCING:
   - Sea surface temperature (SST) effects on COTS recruitment and coral stress
   - Larval immigration rates as external driver of outbreak initiation
   - Temperature anomalies affecting both COTS survival and coral bleaching susceptibility

The model predicts characteristic COTS outbreak patterns: rapid population increase following immigration events and favorable temperatures, sustained high densities while coral resources remain, then population collapse as corals are depleted. Coral recovery occurs during low COTS periods, with fast-growing Acropora recovering more quickly than slow-growing species, setting the stage for subsequent outbreaks.

Key mechanisms for outbreak dynamics:
- Immigration pulses provide initial propagules
- Warm temperatures enhance larval survival and recruitment
- Allee effects allow populations to establish once a threshold is reached
- Abundant coral resources sustain high COTS densities
- Resource depletion triggers population crashes
- Differential coral recovery rates influence outbreak frequency
