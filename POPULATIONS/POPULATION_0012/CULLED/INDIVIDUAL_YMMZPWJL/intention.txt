MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Age-structured mortality captures juvenile vs adult life history differences
2. Nutrient-mediated larval survival with sigmoidal threshold provides outbreak trigger mechanism
3. Dynamic prey-switching between Acropora and massive corals
4. Multiple density-dependent feedbacks (Allee, crowding, food limitation)

Critical Gap Identified:
The model lacks temporal lag in recruitment response. COTS have a 2-4 week larval development period, 
and successful recruitment requires sustained favorable conditions over multiple spawning events. 
The current instantaneous recruitment (Equation 3) cannot capture:
- Multi-year accumulation of favorable environmental conditions
- Delayed population response to environmental triggers
- Temporal smoothing that generates realistic boom-bust periodicity

This gap is particularly important for the PROJECT CONTEXT goal of "accurately capturing the timing, 
magnitude, and duration of population explosions."

=== PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT ===

Implementation: Time-Lagged Recruitment Integration

Add a 2-year moving average of recruitment potential to represent:
1. Integration of larval supply over multiple spawning seasons
2. Requirement for sustained favorable conditions to trigger outbreaks
3. Biological delay between spawning and settlement/recruitment

Mathematical Approach:
- New state variable: recruitment_potential (accumulated favorable conditions)
- Recruitment potential increases when environmental conditions favor larval survival
- Recruitment potential decays over time (representing larval mortality and dispersal)
- Actual recruitment is proportional to accumulated recruitment potential
- Time constant ~2 years matches larval development and early juvenile survival period

Ecological Justification:
- COTS spawn multiple times per year; successful cohorts require sustained favorable conditions
- Larval survival depends on food availability (phytoplankton) over weeks-to-months
- Early juvenile survival (0-6 months) is highly variable and environmentally sensitive
- Outbreaks typically follow 2-3 years of above-average larval supply

Expected Improvements:
1. More realistic outbreak periodicity (multi-year cycles rather than annual fluctuations)
2. Better capture of delayed response to environmental triggers
3. Improved prediction of outbreak timing relative to SST and nutrient conditions
4. More gradual population build-up consistent with observed outbreak development

Parameters Added:
- log_recruitment_memory: Time constant for recruitment potential accumulation (years)
- log_recruitment_threshold: Minimum accumulated potential needed for significant recruitment

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding critical temporal dynamics for 
episodic outbreak prediction.
