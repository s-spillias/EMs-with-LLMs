 1 Update intention.txt with our assessment and reasoning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 2 Add a new parameter outbreak_feedback in parameters.json (with ecological justification).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 3 Update model.cpp to declare the new parameter and then use it in the outbreak decline calculation.

 Assessment: After evaluating the model residuals, the current outbreak representation appears to oversimplify the environmental feedback on outbreak decline. Outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish are not only driven by intrinsic dynamics but are also heavily influenced by environmental conditions that modulate the duration and magnitude of the decline phase.              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement: Introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_feedback", to act as a multiplicative modifier on the outbreak decline term. This feedback parameter captures indirect ecological influences (e.g., water quality, temperature anomalies) that could slow or accelerate the decline post-peak outbreak. Such an addition should help in better fitting the pesky boom‐bust cycles a
