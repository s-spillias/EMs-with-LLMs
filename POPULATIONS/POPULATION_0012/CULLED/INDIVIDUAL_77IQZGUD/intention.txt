Assessment: After evaluating the model residuals, the current outbreak representation appears to oversimplify the environmental feedback on outbreak decline. Outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish are not only driven by intrinsic dynamics but are also heavily influenced by environmental conditions that modulate the duration and magnitude of the decline phase. 

Improvement: Introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_feedback", to act as a multiplicative modifier on the outbreak decline term. This feedback parameter captures indirect ecological influences (e.g., water quality, temperature anomalies) that could slow or accelerate the decline post-peak outbreak. Such an addition should help in better fitting the pesky boom‚Äêbust cycles and provide deeper ecological insight.
