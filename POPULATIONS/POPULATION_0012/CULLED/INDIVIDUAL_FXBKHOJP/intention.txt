Assessment:
The current model captures outbreak dynamics using logistic growth and a threshold-based outbreak trigger. However, the recovery component for coral communities is oversimplified by employing a linear gap-to-maximum approach. Ecologically, coral recovery is nonlinear and often saturates when cover is very low due to recovery limitations. To capture this, I have introduced a new parameter, "coral_recovery_saturation", which acts as a Michaelisâ€“Menten saturation constant. This adjustment enhances model realism by better reflecting the delayed and limited coral recovery under severe predation pressure, thereby improving the prediction of outbreak magnitude and duration.
