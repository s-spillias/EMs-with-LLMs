Assessment and Model Refinement:
---------------------------------------------------
Our evaluation indicates that while the current model captures the general boom‐bust cycle of COTS outbreaks and their predatory effects on coral communities, the outbreak trigger function may oversimplify the rapid acceleration in outbreak onset observed in the data. Residual analysis suggests a non‐linear threshold effect that is better captured by incorporating a higher‐order (quadratic) term.

To address this, we introduce an ecological improvement by adding a new parameter “outbreak_acceleration” to include a quadratic contribution to the outbreak trigger. This change reflects the idea that as COTS density increases (relative to carrying_capacity), the outbreak probability accelerates rapidly once a threshold is approached due to positive feedback mechanisms in the system. This refinement aims to improve the timing, magnitude, and duration predictions of outbreak phases.
