[Assessment]
Residual analysis indicates that while the model fits the data overall, it tends to underestimate the rapid surge in COTS numbers during outbreak phases. This suggests that the outbreak trigger may be too gradual near the threshold.

[Chosen Improvement]
To capture the rapid onset of COTS outbreaks more accurately, we introduce a higher-order sensitivity into the outbreak trigger by adding a new parameter, "outbreak_acceleration". This parameter scales the effect of the excess over the outbreak threshold in the logistic function. By multiplying the difference (cots_pred[t-1] - outbreak_threshold * carrying_capacity) by outbreak_acceleration, the model can produce a steeper and more responsive outbreak curve once the threshold is exceeded.

Ecological Justification:
- A steeper outbreak response is consistent with field observations of sudden COTS surges.
- The new parameter provides a tunable mechanism to reflect environmental and biological feedback that sharpens outbreak onset.
