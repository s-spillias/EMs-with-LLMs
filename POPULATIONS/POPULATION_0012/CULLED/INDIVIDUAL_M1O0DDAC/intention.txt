Project Assessment and Improvement Plan:

Assessment:
- The current model employs a smooth logistic function to trigger outbreaks of COTS, resulting in predictions that understate the sharp onset and magnitude of real outbreak events.
- Residual analysis revealed that the outbreak transitions are too gradual relative to the observed boom-bust cycles.

Improvement:
- Introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_exponent", to modify the outbreak trigger function by raising the logistic term to this exponent. This change captures a sharper, threshold-like response in outbreak dynamics.
- Ecologically, this adjustment reflects that outbreaks are often driven by feedback processes and resource limits that cause sudden transitions rather than gradual changes.
- All calculations in the prediction loop continue to use only previous time step values (avoiding data leakage).

End of assessment.
