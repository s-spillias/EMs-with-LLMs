Assessment:
The residuals indicate that while the overall boom‐bust cycle is captured, the outbreak trigger timing shows discrepancies.
We hypothesize that temperature anomalies (e.g. seasonal stress events) may heighten outbreak sensitivity.
To capture this, we introduce a new parameter “temperature_anomaly_effect” that multiplicatively modulates outbreak sharpness.
This improvement addresses indirect feedback mechanisms where coral stress from warming increases outbreak onset intensity.
