Assessment:
The current model captures the general boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks. However, residual analysis indicates that the model underestimates the rapid decline phase following an outbreak. The existing outbreak trigger based solely on a logistic transformation does not fully capture the strong non-linear, threshold-dependent collapse observed in the data.

Improvement:
Introduce an additional non-linear outbreak feedback mechanism parameterized by "outbreak_feedback". This parameter enhances the decline rate when COTS populations exceed the outbreak threshold (outbreak_threshold Ã— carrying_capacity), thereby capturing accelerated collapse dynamics due to resource depletion and behavioral feedbacks.
