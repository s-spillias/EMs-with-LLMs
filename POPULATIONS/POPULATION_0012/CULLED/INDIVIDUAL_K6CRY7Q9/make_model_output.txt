Below is our plan for the improvement:                                                                                                 

Assessment and chosen improvement:                                                                                                     
The current model captures logistic growth with an outbreak trigger and coral predation dynamics. However, it does not incorporate any 
explicit feedback from coral loss on outbreak dynamics. Ecologically, as coral cover declines (due to predation), the reef’s structural
and ecological stability diminishes, potentially further intensifying COTS outbreak dynamics. To capture this indirect feedback loop,  
we add a new parameter—outbreak_coral_feedback—to modulate the effective outbreak trigger steepness based on previous coral cover. This
modification uses only previous time‑step predictions (avoiding data leakage) and should improve the fit in capturing the boom‐bust    
cycles described in the PROJECT CONTEXT.                                                                                               

The changes are:                                                                                                                       

 1 intention.txt: Document the assessment and reasoning.                                                                               
 2 parameters.json: Add a new parameter outbreak_coral_feedback with clear ecological justification.                                   
 3 model.cpp:                                                                                                                          
    • Add a new PARAMETER(outbreak_coral_feedback); in the parameter declarations.                                                     
    • In the COTS dynamics loop, update how effective_sharpness is computed by incorporating coral cover feedback. In particular,      
      compute the coral deficit from prior fast/slow coral predictions and multiply the original effective_sharpness by a factor that  
      increases with coral deficit.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 The current model captures logistic growth, non‐linear outbreak trigger dynamics, and coral predation. However, it oversimplifies     
 feedback pathways by not considering that reduced coral cover can intensify outbreak dynamics, destabilizing the ecosystem further.   
 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                   
 Incorporate an ecological feedback mechanism through a new parameter, "outbreak_coral_feedback". This parameter amplifies the outbrea 
 trigger steepness when the coral cover (averaged from fast‐ and slow-growing coral predictions) is low. This modification better      
 reflects the boom–bust cycles observed in the ecosystem.

Once you have applied these changes, you can build your model and run it to observe if the new feedback mechanism improves the         
reproduction of the observed outbreak timing and magnitude.
