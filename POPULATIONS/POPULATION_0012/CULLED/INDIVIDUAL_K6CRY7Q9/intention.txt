Assessment:
The current model captures logistic growth, non‐linear outbreak trigger dynamics, and coral predation. However, it oversimplifies feedback pathways by not considering that reduced coral cover can intensify outbreak dynamics, destabilizing the ecosystem further.
Chosen Improvement:
Incorporate an ecological feedback mechanism through a new parameter, "outbreak_coral_feedback". This parameter amplifies the outbreak trigger steepness when the coral cover (averaged from fast‐ and slow-growing coral predictions) is low. This modification better reflects the boom–bust cycles observed in the ecosystem.
