Ecosystem Model for Episodic Outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish:
This model dynamically simulates the boom-bust cycles of COTS populations on the Great Barrier Reef.
Key ecological processes include:
1. Logistic-type COTS population growth with smooth, threshold-driven outbreak decline.
2. Selective predation effects on fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. & Porites spp.) coral communities.
3. Coral recovery dynamics moderated by resource availability and predation pressure.
Environmental modifiers and smooth transitions ensure numerical stability and ecological realism.
Prediction is based strictly on previous time-step values to prevent data leakage.
