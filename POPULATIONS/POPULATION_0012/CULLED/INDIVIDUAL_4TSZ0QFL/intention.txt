Assessment:
The current model captures key dynamics of COTS outbreaks including logistic growth, outbreak-triggered decline, and the impact of coral predation.
However, the environmental influence on outbreak triggering is modeled linearly.
We propose adding a saturating effect by introducing a new parameter "environmental_saturation".
This parameter, used in a tanh transformation with environmental_modifier, reflects that extreme environmental conditions yield diminishing increases in outbreak initiation.
This improvement better reflects ecological reality regarding threshold responses in natural systems.
