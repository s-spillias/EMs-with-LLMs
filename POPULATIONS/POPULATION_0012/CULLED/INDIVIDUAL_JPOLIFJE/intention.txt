Updated assessment and model refinement rationale:
1. The current model uses logistic growth with a smooth outbreak trigger, which may oversimplify the complex dynamics of COTS outbreaks.
2. Residual analysis indicated that outbreak intensity may be under-represented.
3. To better capture the non-linear escalation of outbreaks, a new parameter "outbreak_nonlinearity" is introduced. This parameter non-linearly amplifies the outbreak trigger when COTS population exceeds a threshold, reflecting ecological feedback mechanisms.
