Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model captures boom-bust dynamics and coral predation by COTS; however, it uses a fixed carrying capacity. 
2. Given that the primary resource for COTS is coral, it is ecologically realistic to let the carrying capacity vary with coral availability.
3. We introduce an effective carrying capacity that increases when coral cover is high and declines when coral cover is low.
4. The new parameter, coral_carrying_capacity_modifier, quantitatively scales this effect.
This modification improves the model's ability to capture feedback between coral depletion and COTS outbreak magnitude without risking data leakage.
