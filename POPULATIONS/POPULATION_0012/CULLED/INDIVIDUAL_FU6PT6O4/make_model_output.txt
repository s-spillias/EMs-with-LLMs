Below is our plan. We have decided to improve the ecological realism by allowing the effective carrying capacity for COTS to vary with coral availability. Ecologically, if the coral cover is high the system can sustain larger COTS outbreaks (more resource available), whereas when coral cover is low the effective carrying capacity should be lower. This introduces an        
indirect feedback whereby coral depletion inherently limits further COTS growth. We add a new parameter, coral_carrying_capacity_modifier, and update the COTS growth equation to compute an effective carrying capacity as                                                                                                                                                            

effective_capacity = carrying_capacity × [1 + coral_carrying_capacity_modifier × (coral_availability − 0.5)],                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

where coral_availability is the normalized coral cover (from ~0 to 1). This change is both ecologically justified and mathematically robust.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 1. The current model captures boom-bust dynamics and coral predation by COTS; however, it uses a fixed carrying capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
 2. Given that the primary resource for COTS is coral, it is ecologically realistic to let the carrying capacity vary with coral availability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 3. We introduce an effective carrying capacity that increases when coral cover is high and declines when coral cover is low.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 4. The new parameter, coral_carrying_capacity_modifier, quantitatively scales this effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 This modification improves the model's ability to capture feedback between coral depletion and COTS outbreak magnitude without risking data leakage.
