Assessment:
The current model reasonably fits the outbreak data but underestimates the non-linear response of COTS populations to extreme environmental conditions. In particular, the linear SST multiplier does not capture the saturating response observed in outbreak events. To address this, we propose incorporating a saturating non-linear environmental modifier in the COTS growth equation. This is achieved by introducing two new parameters ("beta_env" and "gamma_env") that scale and saturate the SST effect, respectively. This improvement better reflects the rapid escalation and eventual plateau in outbreak intensity.
