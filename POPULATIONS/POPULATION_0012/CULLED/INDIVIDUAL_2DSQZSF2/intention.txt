Assessment:
The current model adequately captures logistic growth and outbreak-induced declines in COTS, as well as coral recovery dynamics. However, the outbreak trigger is solely determined by COTS abundance relative to carrying capacity. Ecologically, abundant coral (the prey) increases the predation pressure, enhancing the outbreak decline. Therefore, a feedback mechanism incorporating both fast- and slow-growing coral cover is introduced. The new modification uses a parameter "coral_effect" to scale the influence of average coral cover on the outbreak trigger, such that when coral cover is high (relative to a 50% benchmark), the outbreak declines are intensified. This improvement captures an important indirect pathway in the ecosystem dynamics.
