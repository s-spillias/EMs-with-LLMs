Assessment and Improvement:
- The current model adequately fits the data but conflates the impacts of COTS predation on both fast-growing and slow-growing coral.
- Residual analysis revealed systematic biases in the coral predictions, suggesting that fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites spp.) corals respond differently to predation.
- Improvement: Split the coral predation efficiency into two distinct parameters (fast_coral_predation_efficiency and slow_coral_predation_efficiency) to capture these species-specific vulnerabilities.
- Ecological justification: Fast-growing corals are often more exposed/accessible to COTS, while slow-growing corals have inherent resilience or refugia, warranting different predation efficiencies.
- Note: All prediction calculations continue to use only previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
