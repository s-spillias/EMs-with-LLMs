Assessment and Improvement:
After evaluating the current model and its residuals, it appears that the COTS outbreak dynamics are well‐captured overall, but the model may over‐predict COTS growth at high densities. This suggests an oversimplification of density‐dependent processes. In reality, high COTS densities are often accompanied by interference competition (e.g. due to competition for resources or space), which slows individual growth rates. 
To address this, we add a new parameter, "cots_interference", representing the intensity of density‐dependent interference. The COTS growth term is updated to include a dampening factor 1/(1 + cots_interference * cots_pred[t-1]) so that growth is reduced at high densities. This change should improve the accuracy of outbreak magnitude and duration predictions while aligning with observed ecological behavior.
