Below is our proposed ecological improvement. Based on an assessment of the model (including inspection of residuals), the current formulation successfully captures core outbreak dynamics but appears to systematically over‐predict growth at high COTS densities. One key ecological process that may be oversimplified is density‐dependent interference among COTS individuals.  
In nature, as COTS numbers grow, individual interactions (e.g. competition for space or behavioural interference) can slow further population increase. To capture this mechanism we add a new parameter, cots_interference, and then modify the COTS growth term so that growth is dampened at high densities via a factor 1/(1 + cots_interference * cots_pred[t-1]). This change    
helps ensure that growth does not unrealistically overshoot when densities are high and that the boom‐bust cycles are better constrained. The corresponding ecological justification has been added in the new intention.txt documentation and in parameters.json.

 After evaluating the current model and its residuals, it appears that the COTS outbreak dynamics are well‐captured overall, but the model may over‐predict COTS growth at high densities. This suggests an oversimplification of density‐dependent processes. In reality, high COTS densities are often accompanied by interference competition (e.g. due to competition for resource 
 or space), which slows individual growth rates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, we add a new parameter, "cots_interference", representing the intensity of density‐dependent interference. The COTS growth term is updated to include a dampening factor 1/(1 + cots_interference * cots_pred[t-1]) so that growth is reduced at high densities. This change should improve the accuracy of outbreak magnitude and duration predictions while aligni 
 with observed ecological behavior.
