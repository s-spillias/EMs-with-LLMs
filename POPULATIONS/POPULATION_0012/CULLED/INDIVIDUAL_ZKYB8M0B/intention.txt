Model Assessment and Improvement:

1. Assessment:
- The current model uses logistic growth combined with a smooth outbreak trigger that depends on COTS density and coral availability.
- While it generally captures the boom-bust cycle, residuals indicate that when coral cover is high the model underestimates outbreak magnitude. This suggests that the linear dependence on coral availability in the outbreak trigger may be insufficient.

2. Chosen Improvement:
- We modify the outbreak trigger in model.cpp by replacing the linear coral availability term with its square (i.e. a quadratic term). This change increases the sensitivity of the outbreak trigger when coral cover is abundant, better reflecting the threshold dynamics seen in ecological observations.
  
3. Ecological Justification:
- Ecologically, a quadratic term implies that small increases in coral cover past a critical threshold can lead to disproportionately higher outbreak risks, aligning with observed outbreak dynamics.
- This improvement, while slightly more complex, is supported by feedback mechanisms between coral resource availability and COTS outbreak intensity.
