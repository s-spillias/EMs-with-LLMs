Assessment:
The current model captures the major dynamics of COTS outbreaks, including logistic growth and predation on coral groups. However, the outbreak trigger mechanism appears somewhat oversimplified when compared to observed residuals. In particular, the rapid shift from outbreak to bust phases may benefit from a non-linear feedback mechanism that delays the full transition. 

Improvement:
We add a new parameter, "outbreak_feedback_coef," to introduce an additional non‐linear amplification (quadratic term) into the effective outbreak trigger. This enhancement is ecologically justified by the known delayed predator-prey and intraspecific interactions in COTS populations. The new parameter modulates the outbreak trigger based on the previous COTS population (normalised by carrying capacity), thereby improving the model’s ability to capture both the timing and magnitude of outbreak events.
