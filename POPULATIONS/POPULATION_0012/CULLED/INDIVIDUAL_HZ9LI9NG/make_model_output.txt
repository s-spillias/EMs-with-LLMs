Below are the proposed changes. We are improving the ecological realism of the outbreak trigger by adding a new feedback mechanism.    
This new parameter—outbreak_feedback_coef—introduces an additional non‐linear amplification of the outbreak trigger based on the       
previous COTS population normalised by the carrying capacity. This change helps better capture the delayed feedback mechanisms typical 
in ecological outbreak dynamics, thereby addressing the boom‐bust cycles more faithfully while still preventing data leakage by using  
only previous time step values.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 The current model captures the major dynamics of COTS outbreaks, including logistic growth and predation on coral groups. However, th 
 outbreak trigger mechanism appears somewhat oversimplified when compared to observed residuals. In particular, the rapid shift from   
 outbreak to bust phases may benefit from a non-linear feedback mechanism that delays the full transition.                             
                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement:                                                                                                                          
 We add a new parameter, "outbreak_feedback_coef," to introduce an additional non‐linear amplification (quadratic term) into the       
 effective outbreak trigger. This enhancement is ecologically justified by the known delayed predator-prey and intraspecific           
 interactions in COTS populations. The new parameter modulates the outbreak trigger based on the previous COTS population (normalised  
 carrying capacity), thereby improving the model’s ability to capture both the timing and magnitude of outbreak events.

These changes improve the ecological realism by incorporating a delayed feedback term into the outbreak trigger mechanism while        
ensuring that only previous time step values are used.
