Concise Model Intention:
This TMB model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. 
The model captures boom-bust cycles driven by larval immigration and resource constraints, with COTS outbreaks 
triggered when past abundances exceed a threshold. These outbreaks result in elevated predation rates on fast-growing 
Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites coral communities. The model uses smooth transitions to avoid abrupt changes and 
integrates all observations into the likelihood for robust parameter estimation.
