Assessment:
-----------
The current model captures the basic boom-bust cycles of COTS and incorporates resource limitation via coral availability. However, the resource limitation mechanism is oversimplified. In nature, when coral cover becomes very low, the available resources for COTS decrease nonlinearly, leading to a sharper reduction in growth. 

Chosen Improvement:
-------------------
Introduce a new parameter, "resource_feedback_exponent", to nonlinearly modulate the effect of coral availability on COTS growth. By applying an exponent to the resource factor, the model can represent a more abrupt decline in COTS population growth when coral cover is severely reduced, which better reflects the ecological dynamics observed during outbreak events.

This modification improves the ecological realism of the model without introducing data leakage (only using past state values in predictions).
