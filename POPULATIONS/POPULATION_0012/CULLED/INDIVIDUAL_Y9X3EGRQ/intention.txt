Model Assessment and Improvement:

1. Current model fits the data moderately well, capturing the boom-bust cycles of COTS dynamics and their predation on coral communities. However, the outbreak trigger is solely a function of COTS population states and environmental modifiers, without feedback from the coral cover.
2. Given the ecological context, incorporating a feedback mechanism in which coral cover modifies the outbreak threshold can better capture the dynamics. This reflects the idea that lower coral cover (indicative of stressed reef conditions) may lower the outbreak threshold, triggering outbreaks earlier, while higher coral cover can buffer the outbreak onset.
3. Therefore, a new parameter "coral_based_outbreak_mod" is introduced to adjust the outbreak threshold dynamically based on coral availability.

This improvement balances increased ecological realism with model parsimony.
