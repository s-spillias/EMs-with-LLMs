   Updated with our assessment and the rationale for introducing a new parameter "coral_based_outbreak_mod" that feeds back coral      
   availability into the outbreak threshold calculation.

   A new parameter "coral_based_outbreak_mod" is added with default value 0.0 and a description outlining its ecological role.         
 3 model.cpp                                                                                                                           
   We modify the outbreak trigger section to compute a modified threshold that is a function of the previous coral cover (using        
   fast_pred and slow_pred from t-1) and the new parameter "coral_based_outbreak_mod". This change ensures the model uses only previous
   time step values for predictions.

 Model Assessment and Improvement:                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                       
 1. Current model fits the data moderately well, capturing the boom-bust cycles of COTS dynamics and their predation on coral          
 communities. However, the outbreak trigger is solely a function of COTS population states and environmental modifiers, without feedba 
 from the coral cover.                                                                                                                 
 2. Given the ecological context, incorporating a feedback mechanism in which coral cover modifies the outbreak threshold can better   
 capture the dynamics. This reflects the idea that lower coral cover (indicative of stressed reef conditions) may lower the outbreak   
 threshold, triggering outbreaks earlier, while higher coral cover can buffer the outbreak onset.                                      
 3. Therefore, a new parameter "coral_based_outbreak_mod" is introduced to adjust the outbreak threshold dynamically based on coral    
 availability.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                       
 This improvement balances increased ecological realism with model parsimony.
