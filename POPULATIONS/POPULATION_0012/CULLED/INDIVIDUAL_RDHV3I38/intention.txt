MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model captures many key COTS outbreak mechanisms:
- Age-structured population dynamics with temperature-dependent maturation
- Nutrient-mediated larval survival creating outbreak triggers
- Local spawning feedback for self-sustaining outbreaks
- Asymmetric coral thermal responses
- Type II functional responses for selective predation

However, a critical reproductive mechanism is missing that limits the model's ability to capture the explosive, threshold-driven nature of COTS outbreaks.

=== IDENTIFIED GAP ===

The current local spawning formulation uses linear density dependence:
  recruitment_local = local_fecundity * cots_prev * maturity_prev^2 * food_availability

This oversimplifies COTS reproductive biology. As broadcast spawners, COTS require sufficient adult density for successful fertilization. Field studies (Babcock et al. 2016, Pratchett et al. 2014) show:

1. Fertilization success is extremely low at densities < 0.15 individuals/m²
2. Fertilization success rapidly increases between 0.15-0.30 individuals/m²
3. Fertilization success saturates at high densities (>0.5 individuals/m²)
4. This creates a reproductive tipping point that triggers self-sustaining outbreaks

Without this mechanism, the model cannot capture:
- Why small recruitment pulses sometimes trigger outbreaks and sometimes don't
- The explosive transition from low-density to outbreak state
- The bistability between endemic and outbreak equilibria
- Why outbreaks become self-sustaining once initiated

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add density-dependent fertilization success to local spawning using a sigmoidal function:

EQUATION: Fertilization success function
  fertilization_success = 1 / (1 + exp(-fertilization_steepness * (cots_prev - fertilization_threshold)))

EQUATION: Modified local recruitment
  recruitment_local = local_fecundity * cots_prev * maturity_prev^2 * food_availability * fertilization_success

New parameters:
- fertilization_threshold: Adult density at which fertilization success = 50% (individuals/m²)
  Literature suggests ~0.22 individuals/m² (Babcock et al. 2016)
  
- log_fertilization_steepness: Controls abruptness of fertilization transition (m²/individuals)
  Higher values = sharper threshold = more explosive outbreak dynamics
  Initial estimate: log(20) = 3.0, giving steep but realistic transition

=== ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION ===

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT requirements:

1. "Mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events"
   → Fertilization threshold creates clear outbreak trigger mechanism
   → Once crossed, positive feedback sustains outbreak

2. "Timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions"
   → Threshold dynamics explain sudden onset (timing)
   → Positive feedback above threshold explains rapid growth (magnitude)
   → Depletion of coral food eventually breaks feedback (duration)

3. "Boom-bust cycles"
   → Creates bistable system with low-density and outbreak attractors
   → Natural cycling between states driven by stochastic recruitment events

=== EXPECTED DYNAMICS ===

Below fertilization threshold (~0.22/m²):
- Immigration recruitment occurs but local spawning contributes minimally
- Population remains at low endemic levels
- System vulnerable to stochastic extinction

Near fertilization threshold:
- Small recruitment pulses can push population over threshold
- Rapid transition to outbreak state
- High sensitivity to environmental conditions

Above fertilization threshold:
- Strong local spawning feedback
- Self-sustaining outbreak even without immigration
- Population grows until coral food depleted or density-dependent mortality dominates

This creates the characteristic COTS outbreak pattern: long periods at low density punctuated by explosive outbreaks when conditions align to push population over the reproductive threshold.

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

The fertilization success function is implemented using the same sigmoidal form as the nutrient threshold response, ensuring mathematical consistency. The function is bounded between 0 and 1, representing the proportion of spawned gametes that successfully fertilize.

The fertilization_threshold parameter should be constrained to biologically realistic densities (0.1-0.5 individuals/m²) based on field observations. The steepness parameter controls how abrupt the transition is - higher values create sharper thresholds and more explosive outbreak dynamics.

This modification maintains all existing model structure while adding a single critical nonlinearity that fundamentally changes outbreak dynamics in an ecologically justified way.
