Assessment and Improvement:
Our initial analysis of residuals indicates that while the model reproduces the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks reasonably, there is an underestimation in the decline (bust) phase. This discrepancy suggests that additional density-dependent processes may be at play during high population levels.
To address this, we have introduced an intraspecific competition term into the COTS growth equation. Ecologically, at high densities, interference and competition among COTS can reduce their effective growth rate. This modification helps capture the rapid collapse observed post-outbreak.
