Below is our proposed improvement and corresponding edits. We decided to incorporate an intraspecific competition term into the COTS growth equation. Our assessment found that although the model captures outbreak timing and magnitude fairly well, the sharp declines observed in the data (the bust phase) are not entirely explained by the current logistic and outbreak‐trigger
functions. In reality, very high COTS densities may lead to increased competition and interference, reducing growth more than expected. By subtracting a quadratic density–dependent term (using a new parameter intraspecific_competition) from the growth rate, we better capture these boom–bust dynamics. We have also updated the documentation in intention.txt and introduced   
the new parameter in parameters.json with a clear ecological justification.

 Our initial analysis of residuals indicates that while the model reproduces the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks reasonably, there is an underestimation in the decline (bust) phase. This discrepancy suggests that additional density-dependent processes may be at play during high population levels.                                                                       
 To address this, we have introduced an intraspecific competition term into the COTS growth equation. Ecologically, at high densities, interference and competition among COTS can reduce their effective growth rate. This modification helps capture the rapid collapse observed post-outbreak.
