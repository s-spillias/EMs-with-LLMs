Assessment:
The current model effectively simulates the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and coral predation. However, the coral recovery rules assume linear recovery toward full cover without accounting for density‐dependent limitations (i.e. intraspecific competition among corals). 

Chosen Improvement:
We add a density-dependent competition term by introducing a new parameter, "coral_competition_strength". This parameter reduces the recovery rate as the predicted coral cover approaches 100% by multiplying the recovery term with a factor 
    (1 - coral_competition_strength * (predicted_coral/100)).
This ecological mechanism better reflects limits in resource availability and space when coral communities are near saturation, and thereby improves the model’s fit to the observed residuals.

Note: Only previous timestep predictions are used, ensuring no data leakage.
