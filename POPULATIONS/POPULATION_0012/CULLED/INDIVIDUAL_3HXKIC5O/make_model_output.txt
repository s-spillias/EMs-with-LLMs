Below is our proposal. We have updated the model’s documentation (intention.txt) with our ecological assessment and reasoning, added a 
new parameter ("coral_competition_strength") to capture subtle density‐dependent feedback on coral recovery, and modified the coral    
recovery equations in model.cpp so that recovery slows as coral cover increases. Note that in each update only previous time step      
predictions are used.

 =======                                                                                                                               
 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 The current model effectively simulates the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and coral predation. However, the coral recovery rul 
 assume linear recovery toward full cover without accounting for density‐dependent limitations (i.e. intraspecific competition among   
 corals).                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                       
 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                   
 We add a density-dependent competition term by introducing a new parameter, "coral_competition_strength". This parameter reduces the  
 recovery rate as the predicted coral cover approaches 100% by multiplying the recovery term with a factor                             
     (1 - coral_competition_strength * (predicted_coral/100)).                                                                         
 This ecological mechanism better reflects limits in resource availability and space when coral communities are near saturation, and   
 thereby improves the model’s fit to the observed residuals.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                       
 Note: Only previous timestep predictions are used, ensuring no data leakage.
