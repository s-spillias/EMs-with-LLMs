MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE
==========================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION
------------------------

Strengths:
1. Age-structured COTS population with temperature-dependent maturation (Q10 formulation)
2. Dual recruitment pathways (immigration + local spawning feedback)
3. Nutrient-mediated larval survival creating outbreak trigger mechanism
4. Type II functional response for selective coral predation
5. Temperature-dependent coral growth with species-specific thermal optima

Parameter Review Findings:
- temp_optimal_slow constrained to 27.0°C (literature-updated, very narrow bounds)
- Both coral types have identical thermal sensitivity (-1.5), contradicting ecological knowledge
- Q10_maturation = 2.5 suggests strong temperature dependence on development
- Maturation dynamics use simple linear interpolation between life stages

Critical Gap Identified:
The model lacks BLEACHING-INDUCED CORAL MORTALITY, which is essential for a contemporary GBR model because:
- Mass bleaching events (1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020) are major disturbances
- Differential bleaching susceptibility (Acropora > massive corals) affects COTS food availability
- Post-bleaching recovery phases may facilitate COTS recruitment
- Temperature data is already tracked but not used for thermal stress mortality

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: THERMAL STRESS MORTALITY
----------------------------------------------

Ecological Justification:
Add temperature-dependent bleaching mortality to capture realistic disturbance-recovery dynamics on the GBR. This mechanism:

1. Creates episodic coral mortality events when SST exceeds bleaching thresholds
2. Differentiates fast coral (Acropora) vulnerability from slow coral (massive) vulnerability
3. Generates boom-bust cycles in coral cover that interact with COTS outbreak dynamics
4. Allows COTS outbreaks during post-bleaching recovery when juvenile corals are abundant

Mathematical Implementation:
- Exponential mortality function: mort_bleach = bleach_sensitivity * exp(bleach_steepness * (SST - bleach_threshold))
- Only activates when SST > threshold (using conditional expression)
- Separate parameters for fast vs slow corals reflecting differential susceptibility
- Scales with thermal anomaly magnitude (degree heating concept)

New Parameters Added:
1. bleach_threshold_fast (°C): Temperature above which fast corals experience bleaching mortality
   - Initial: 29.5°C (Acropora bleach at ~1°C above summer maximum)
   - Bounds: 29.0-30.5°C

2. bleach_threshold_slow (°C): Temperature above which slow corals experience bleaching mortality  
   - Initial: 30.5°C (massive corals more thermally tolerant, +1°C relative to Acropora)
   - Bounds: 30.0-31.5°C

3. log_bleach_sensitivity_fast (year⁻¹): Log baseline bleaching mortality rate for fast corals
   - Initial: 0.0 (exp(0) = 1.0 year⁻¹, moderate mortality when threshold exceeded)
   - Bounds: -1.0 to 2.0

4. log_bleach_sensitivity_slow (year⁻¹): Log baseline bleaching mortality rate for slow corals
   - Initial: -0.7 (exp(-0.7) = 0.5 year⁻¹, lower than fast corals)
   - Bounds: -2.0 to 1.5

5. log_bleach_steepness (°C⁻¹): Log steepness of exponential thermal stress response
   - Initial: 0.7 (exp(0.7) = 2.0 °C⁻¹, mortality doubles per degree above threshold)
   - Bounds: 0.0 to 2.0
   - Shared between coral types (thermal stress scaling is similar, but baseline differs)

Expected Ecological Outcomes:
- Bleaching events create coral mortality pulses during warm years
- Fast corals decline more rapidly than slow corals during thermal stress
- Post-bleaching recovery creates variable coral community states
- COTS outbreaks may be suppressed during bleaching (food limitation) or facilitated during recovery
- More realistic representation of contemporary GBR dynamics with climate change

Model Structure Changes:
- Add bleaching mortality terms to fast and slow coral dynamics (Equations 17 and 20)
- Mortality only applies when SST exceeds species-specific thresholds
- Exponential scaling captures non-linear increase in mortality with thermal anomaly severity
- Maintains existing growth and predation terms while adding environmental stressor

This improvement directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT by:
1. Capturing episodic disturbance events that characterize modern GBR dynamics
2. Creating realistic boom-bust cycles in coral communities
3. Allowing COTS outbreak timing to interact with coral recovery phases
4. Maintaining focus on outbreak mechanisms while adding critical environmental context
