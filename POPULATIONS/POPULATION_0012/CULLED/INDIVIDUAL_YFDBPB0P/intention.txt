Assessment:
The current model predicts outbreak dynamics and coral recovery but treats fast- and slow-growing corals independently, ignoring interspecific competition for limited reef space.

Improvement:
I have modified the recovery terms so that both coral types now recover toward a maximum total cover of 100% (i.e. the available space is 100 minus the sum of fast and slow coral cover). This better reflects the ecological reality that increased cover by one coral group limits recovery capacity for the other.

Ecological Justification:
Limited reef space causes competition between coral types. High cover by one group may inhibit the other’s recovery; therefore, using the joint coral cover as a limiter enhances the model’s ability to capture ecosystem feedbacks and the dynamics of outbreak events.
