Assessment:
The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and coral predation reasonably well. However, the mechanism for outbreak decline does not account for ecosystem feedback. In reality, as coral cover decreases the decline may be reduced (sustaining outbreaks) since fewer resources are available to trigger a rapid collapse. 

Improvement:
Add an outbreak decline feedback by modulating the decline with the available coral cover. A new parameter, `coral_dependency_modifier`, is introduced to scale the decline based on the previous time stepâ€™s total coral cover, capturing the ecological feedback between coral availability and outbreak decay.
