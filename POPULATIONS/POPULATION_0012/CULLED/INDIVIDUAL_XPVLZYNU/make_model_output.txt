Below are the proposed changes and their rationales. In our assessment we observed that while the current model captures the overall trend of COTS outbreaks, the abrupt collapse phase is under‐represented. This     
suggests that the outbreak trigger function is too smooth. To improve this, we add a higher-order nonlinearity by raising the outbreak trigger to a new exponent (named outbreak_trigger_exponent). Ecologically, this 
reflects that outbreak collapse may be driven by threshold processes triggered at high population levels. This change adjusts the decline term so that when the outbreak trigger is high the decline intensifies       
non‐linearly, while maintaining the exclusive use of past state variables. We update the intention file with our reasoning, add a new parameter in parameters.json to control the nonlinearity, and then modify        
model.cpp accordingly.

 The current model fits the general trend of COTS outbreaks but may not fully capture the abrupt transitions observed in the residuals. The present outbreak trigger mechanism, while capturing the onset, appears too 
 smooth, thereby oversimplifying the dynamics of outbreak collapse. To address this, we introduce a higher-order nonlinearity by raising the outbreak trigger to a new exponent. This change will allow a sharper,     
 threshold‐like transition in the decline phase, reflecting ecological feedbacks that drive rapid collapses at high COTS densities.
