Assessment:
The current model fits the general trend of COTS outbreaks but may not fully capture the abrupt transitions observed in the residuals. The present outbreak trigger mechanism, while capturing the onset, appears too smooth, thereby oversimplifying the dynamics of outbreak collapse. To address this, we introduce a higher-order nonlinearity by raising the outbreak trigger to a new exponent. This change will allow a sharper, threshold‚Äêlike transition in the decline phase, reflecting ecological feedbacks that drive rapid collapses at high COTS densities.
