Assessment:
The current model implements logistic growth for COTS with a smooth outbreak-triggered decline and a saturating predation response on coral cover. However, it lacks a resource limitation mechanism whereby low coral cover limits the available food for COTS, ultimately constraining their population growth.

Improvement:
We introduce a feedback mechanism by modulating the COTS growth term with coral availability. Specifically, the growth is now scaled by the combined predicted fast and slow coral cover (normalized by 200) and a new parameter `coral_feedback`. This change captures how reduced coral cover restricts COTS growth and thereby better reflects the observed boomâ€“bust outbreak dynamics.
