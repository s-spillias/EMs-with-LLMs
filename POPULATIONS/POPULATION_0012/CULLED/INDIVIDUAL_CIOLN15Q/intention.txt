Assessment:
The model currently captures boom-bust cycles, but residuals indicate misfits during outbreak initiation. While the model addresses key predatorâ€“prey dynamics, the outbreak trigger is oversimplified by using a fixed threshold based only on COTS density.
Improvement:
We introduce a dynamic outbreak threshold that adjusts based on coral availability. When coral is abundant (high resource_factor), the threshold is lowered to trigger outbreaks more readily. Conversely, when coral is scarce, the threshold is raised, reducing outbreak likelihood. This better represents ecological feedback between coral resource status and COTS outbreak dynamics.
A new parameter "threshold_coral_sensitivity" (default value 0.5) is added to modulate this effect. All predictions use previous time step values only, ensuring no data leakage.
