Assessment Summary:
The current model fits the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks reasonably well based on logistic growth and a smooth outbreak trigger. However, it oversimplifies the ecological dynamics by not accounting for the resource limitation imposed by coral cover. This improvement introduces a new parameter, "coral_feedback," to intensify the decline in COTS when coral cover is low. Ecologically, when coral (the primary resource for sustaining COTS) is scarce, the population collapse is accelerated, better capturing the boomâ€“bust dynamics observed in nature.
