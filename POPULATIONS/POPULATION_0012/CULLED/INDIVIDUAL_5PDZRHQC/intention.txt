Assessment:
The current model generally captures outbreak trends but underestimates the timing and magnitude of bursts. Notably, the sea-surface temperature (SST) data is provided but not used to modulate the COTS growth rate.
To better represent ecological dynamics, we incorporate a non-linear saturating effect of SST on COTS growth. A new parameter "temp_half" represents the half‚Äêsaturation constant; i.e., the SST at which the effective growth rate is half its maximum.
This adjustment reflects that warmer previous conditions can trigger rapid growth while cooler conditions inhibit it, thereby improving outbreak characterization without data leakage.
