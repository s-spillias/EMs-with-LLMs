Model Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
1. The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS and coral recovery but oversimplifies the outbreak trigger by relying solely on the COTS population.
2. Residual analysis indicates that the model underestimates the mitigating effects when coral cover is high.
3. To address this, the outbreak trigger calculation is modified by introducing a multiplicative damping term based on previous time-step coral availability. This new term is controlled by the parameter "coral_buffer_exponent", which reflects the buffering capacity of healthy coral communities.
4. Ecologically, a well-maintained coral ecosystem can mitigate outbreak onset by promoting ecological stability and limiting rapid population explosions.
