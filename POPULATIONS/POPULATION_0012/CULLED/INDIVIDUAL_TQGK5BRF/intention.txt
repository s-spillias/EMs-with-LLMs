Assessment and Improvement:
The current model captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and coral response. However, residual analysis indicates that the outbreak initiation is not steep enough compared to observed data. To address this, we introduce a quadratic term in the outbreak trigger function. This additional term (parameter: outbreak_polynomial) adds a non-linear amplification effect, thereby improving the model's ability to replicate the abrupt outbreak onset seen in nature. Such an improvement is ecologically justified because outbreak events may rapidly accelerate due to complex feedbacks once critical thresholds are exceeded.
