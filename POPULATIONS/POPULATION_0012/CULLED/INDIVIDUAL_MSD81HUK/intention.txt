Assessment:
The current model captures the outbreak dynamics reasonably well; however, residual analysis indicates that the outbreak trigger mechanism might underrepresent ecological feedback from coral communities. In ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef, higher coral cover can support larger COTS outbreaks by providing increased food availability, while reduced coral cover may dampen outbreak intensity.

Chosen improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, "coral_activity_modifier", which scales the outbreak trigger sharpness based on the aggregated coral cover (combining fast- and slow-growing coral predictions). This change adds an indirect feedback mechanism that adjusts the sensitivity of outbreak initiation in response to the ecosystem's coral state, ensuring more ecologically realistic boom-bust cycles. Importantly, all prediction calculations continue to use only previous time step states to avoid data leakage.
