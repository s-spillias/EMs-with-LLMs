[Assessment]
The current model reasonably captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations using logistic growth modified by an outbreak trigger based solely on the existing population density. However, analysis of residuals indicates that the model may underpredict the rapid onset of outbreaks.

[Improvement]
To better reflect the ecological dynamics of COTS outbreaks, we introduce an acceleration-based modifier into the outbreak trigger. By incorporating the rate of increase in COTS population (i.e. the difference between the previous two time steps), the model now more effectively captures the rapid escalation observed in outbreak events. Two new parameters are added:
- outbreak_acceleration_threshold: the minimal growth rate that, when exceeded, intensifies the outbreak trigger.
- outbreak_acceleration_factor: a multiplier that enhances outbreak sensitivity when the COTS population increases rapidly.
This change provides a more dynamic non-linear response aligned with ecological feedback mechanisms.
