Below is our plan of action and the proposed changes:                                                                                  

 1 In intention.txt, we will record our assessment and explain our improvement. We explain that although the current model captures    
   boom‐bust dynamics reasonably well using logistic growth and an outbreak trigger based solely on COTS density, ecological evidence  
   indicates that the pace of increase (i.e. the rate of change) also influences outbreak initiation. Therefore, we are introducing an 
   acceleration‐based modifier that uses the population derivative to boost the outbreak trigger when COTS populations are growing very
   rapidly. This is justified by the ecological concept that a rapid surge in COTS numbers may trigger a different (more abrupt)       
   outbreak dynamic.                                                                                                                   
 2 In parameters.json, we add two new parameters:                                                                                      
    • outbreak_acceleration_threshold: the minimal rate of increase required before the outbreak trigger is enhanced, and              
    • outbreak_acceleration_factor: a multiplier that intensifies the outbreak trigger when the rate of increase (beyond the threshold)
      is high.                                                                                                                         
      Both parameters are given priority 2 with ecological justification in their descriptions.                                        
 3 In model.cpp, we add the new parameters into the parameter list. We then modify the outbreak trigger calculation inside the time    
   loop. After computing the usual effective sharpness, if we are beyond the first time step we calculate the COTS population increase 
   (using the difference between the last two predictions) and, if that increase exceeds the threshold, we further boost the effective 
   sharpness. This modification does not use any current time step observed value (only past predictions) so it avoids data leakage.

 [Assessment]                                                                                                                          
 The current model reasonably captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations using logistic growth modified by an outbreak trigge 
 based solely on the existing population density. However, analysis of residuals indicates that the model may underpredict the rapid   
 onset of outbreaks.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                       
 [Improvement]                                                                                                                         
 To better reflect the ecological dynamics of COTS outbreaks, we introduce an acceleration-based modifier into the outbreak trigger. B 
 incorporating the rate of increase in COTS population (i.e. the difference between the previous two time steps), the model now more   
 effectively captures the rapid escalation observed in outbreak events. Two new parameters are added:                                  
 - outbreak_acceleration_threshold: the minimal growth rate that, when exceeded, intensifies the outbreak trigger.                     
 - outbreak_acceleration_factor: a multiplier that enhances outbreak sensitivity when the COTS population increases rapidly.           
 This change provides a more dynamic non-linear response aligned with ecological feedback mechanisms.

Below is the SEARCH/REPLACE block with modifications in POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_1SSO4VJW/model.cpp. This change adds a  
safeguard by ensuring that the COTS prediction is non-negative (using a small constant) when computing the outbreak trigger and        
decline, which should prevent any NaN gradient issues.

Below are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to ensure that the carrying capacity is kept positive (using a safe value) throughout the model,   
which should prevent NaN gradient evaluations resulting from negative carrying_capacity.                                               

1. Insert a safe carrying capacity definition in model.cpp:
