Assessment:
The current model captures the logistic growth of COTS and uses a smooth outbreak trigger; however, it appears to oversimplify the feedback from fast-growing coral cover depletion. Residuals indicate that when Acropora (fast-growing coral) declines significantly, the model under‚Äêpredicts the intensity of COTS outbreaks.
 
Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a feedback mechanism by adding a new parameter, "coral_depletion_feedback". This parameter will amplify the outbreak trigger when fast-growing coral cover is low. Ecologically, reduced coral cover may weaken ecosystem resilience and allow outbreaks to proceed more brutally. This modification adds a non-linear feedback element to better capture the boom-bust dynamics observed.
