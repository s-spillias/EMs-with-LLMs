Assessment: 
The original model employs a linear recovery term for coral cover, which may oversimplify key resource limitation processes and interspecific competition. This approach can underrepresent the slowdown in recovery observed when coral cover is high.
To better capture ecological dynamics of the Great Barrier Reef during COTS outbreaks, a saturating recovery function using a half‚Äêsaturation constant (recovery_half_saturation) is introduced. This parameter modulates recovery nonlinearly, representing the point where increasing coral cover yields diminishing recovery benefits. Residual analysis also indicated that recovery rates need to slow as coral cover nears its maximum.
