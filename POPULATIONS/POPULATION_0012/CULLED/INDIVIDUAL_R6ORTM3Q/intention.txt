Model Assessment and Improvement:
-----------------------------------
The current model adequately captures the basic boom-bust cycle of COTS outbreaks but underestimates the outbreak termination phase. Residuals suggest that additional non‚Äêlinear density dependence could improve the model fit. We propose adding a quadratic density-dependent term to the logistic growth component. This new term (with parameter density_dependent_quadratic) represents additional mortality or interference competition at high COTS densities, ensuring that growth is more heavily curtailed as the population nears or exceeds ecosystem carrying capacity.
