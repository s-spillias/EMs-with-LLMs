Below are our proposed changes. We are adding a new mechanism to capture higher‐order (quadratic) density‐dependence in COTS growth. This addresses the model context by incorporating a non‐linear mortality term that mimics interference competition (or other density-dependent stresses) at high COTS densities. Our assessment found that while basic outbreak dynamics are      
captured, the residuals imply that the termination mechanism of outbreaks might be stronger than predicted by the logistic term alone. The new parameter, density_dependent_quadratic, acts to further reduce growth when COTS numbers are very high.

 The current model adequately captures the basic boom-bust cycle of COTS outbreaks but underestimates the outbreak termination phase. Residuals suggest that additional non‐linear density dependence could improve the model fit. We propose adding a quadratic density-dependent term to the logistic growth component. This new term (with parameter density_dependent_quadratic)   
 represents additional mortality or interference competition at high COTS densities, ensuring that growth is more heavily curtailed as the population nears or exceeds ecosystem carrying capacity.
