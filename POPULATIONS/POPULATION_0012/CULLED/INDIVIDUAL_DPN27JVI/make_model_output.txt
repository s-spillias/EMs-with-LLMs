Below are the proposed changes. I will make edits to three files:                                                                      

 1 POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_DPN27JVI/intention.txt                                                                       
   We update the file with our assessment and reasoning. We explain that the current model fits data reasonably well but could better  
   capture outbreak acceleration by incorporating a higher-order (cubic) term in the outbreak trigger function. This additional term   
   represents complex non-linear feedbacks in COTS dynamics and is ecologically justified by the need to capture abrupt outbreak       
   transitions.                                                                                                                        
 2 POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_DPN27JVI/parameters.json                                                                     
   We add a new parameter outbreak_poly_term (with a default value of 0.0), representing the coefficient for the cubic term that       
   further amplifies outbreak non-linearity. This provides additional flexibility to match the observed boom-bust behavior while being 
   consistent with ecological theory.

   We modify the outbreak trigger calculation to incorporate the new cubic term (using outbreak_poly_term multiplied by the cube of the
   previous COTS population). This change ensures that only values from the previous time step are used and helps capture sharper      
   outbreak transitions observed in the data.

 =======                                                                                                                               
 Assessment and Reasoning:                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                       
 After evaluating the residuals and overall fit of the current model, the model reasonably captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS     
 outbreaks, including the selective predation on fast and slow-growing corals. However, the outbreak trigger function appears          
 oversimplified and lacks sufficient flexibility to capture abrupt outbreak accelerations.                                             
                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, we propose to add a higher-order (cubic) term to the outbreak trigger function. This addition (via a new parameter   
 "outbreak_poly_term") will allow the model to capture more abrupt transitions and overshooting behavior during outbreak initiation.   
 Ecologically, this term can represent complex feedbacks (e.g., delayed resource depletion and density‐dependent effects) that sharpen 
 outbreak responses.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                       
 This improvement avoids data leakage by only using lagged state values and is in line with ecological theory on non-linear dynamics i 
 outbreak systems.

After applying these edits, you can compile the model as usual and check if the new parameter improves the fit to data by capturing    
more abrupt outbreak transitions.
