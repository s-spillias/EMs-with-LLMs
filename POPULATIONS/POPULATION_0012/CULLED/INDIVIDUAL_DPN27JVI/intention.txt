Assessment and Reasoning:

After evaluating the residuals and overall fit of the current model, the model reasonably captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks, including the selective predation on fast and slow-growing corals. However, the outbreak trigger function appears oversimplified and lacks sufficient flexibility to capture abrupt outbreak accelerations.

To address this, we propose to add a higher-order (cubic) term to the outbreak trigger function. This addition (via a new parameter "outbreak_poly_term") will allow the model to capture more abrupt transitions and overshooting behavior during outbreak initiation. Ecologically, this term can represent complex feedbacks (e.g., delayed resource depletion and density‐dependent effects) that sharpen outbreak responses.

This improvement avoids data leakage by only using lagged state values and is in line with ecological theory on non-linear dynamics in outbreak systems.
