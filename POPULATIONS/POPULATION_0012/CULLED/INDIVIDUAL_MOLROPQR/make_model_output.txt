Below are the proposed changes. We will:                                                                                                                                                                               

 1 Update the intention.txt file to document our assessment (the residuals indicate that the early outbreak phase is over‐predicted, and incorporating an Allee effect in the COTS growth term should help capture the 
   ecological threshold for outbreak initiation).                                                                                                                                                                      
 2 Update parameters.json to add a new parameter allee_threshold with an ecological justification.                                                                                                                     
 3 Update model.cpp by adding a new parameter declaration for allee_threshold and then modifying the COTS growth equation in the time loop so that it multiplies the logistic growth term by an Allee effect factor    
   (which slows growth at low abundance).

 Residuals indicate that the current model tends to over‐predict outbreak initiation at low COTS densities. This may be due to an oversimplified logistic growth function. By incorporating an Allee effect – a        
 mechanism that limits growth when the population is too sparse for successful reproduction – the model can better capture the critical threshold needed for an outbreak. This improvement is ecologically justified a 
 COTS, like many species, may have difficulty finding mates at low densities, delaying outbreak onset.
