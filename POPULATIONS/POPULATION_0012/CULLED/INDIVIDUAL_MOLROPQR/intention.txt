Assessment:
Residuals indicate that the current model tends to over‐predict outbreak initiation at low COTS densities. This may be due to an oversimplified logistic growth function. By incorporating an Allee effect – a mechanism that limits growth when the population is too sparse for successful reproduction – the model can better capture the critical threshold needed for an outbreak. This improvement is ecologically justified as COTS, like many species, may have difficulty finding mates at low densities, delaying outbreak onset.
