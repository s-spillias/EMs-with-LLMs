Assessment:
The current model captures the boom-bust cycles and outbreak timing of COTS through logistic growth and a smooth outbreak-trigger decline. However, the fixed predation efficiency does not account for environmental influences on predator behavior and coral vulnerability.

Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, "pred_env_modifier", to dynamically modulate the coral predation term. This modifier reflects how environmental conditions (e.g., temperature anomalies or other stressors) can elevate or reduce the effective predation rate of COTS on both fast- and slow-growing corals. The change provides a more ecologically realistic representation of outbreak dynamics, improving model performance in capturing observed variability.
