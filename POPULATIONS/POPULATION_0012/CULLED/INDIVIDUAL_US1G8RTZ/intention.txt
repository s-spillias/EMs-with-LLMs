Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures the episodic nature of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth with an outbreak trigger. However, the fixed threshold (set at 50% of the carrying capacity) for outbreak initiation may oversimplify the true ecological variability observed in the field. 

To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_threshold", which allows tuning the level (as a fraction of carrying capacity) at which the outbreak is triggered. This change reflects the ecological reality that the onset of outbreaks could vary with environmental conditions and resource limitations. This improvement should help in capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks more flexibly.
