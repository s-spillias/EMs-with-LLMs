Our assessment indicates that while the current model captures logistic growth and outbreak-triggered decline for COTS, it neglects the potential feedback from coral availability on COTS reproduction. Ecologically, lower coral cover can reduce larval success and hence limit outbreak magnitude. We improve the model by incorporating resource limitation via an average coral cover term (from fast- and slow-growing coral) in the growth equation. This change helps capture boom-bust cycles more realistically.
