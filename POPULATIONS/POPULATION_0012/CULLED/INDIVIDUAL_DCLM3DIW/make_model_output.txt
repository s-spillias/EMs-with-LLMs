Below is the plan for the improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                 

 1 Assessment and Reasoning (intention):                                                                                                                                                                               
   The assessment suggests that while the current model uses logistic growth with an outbreak‐trigger decay, it does not account for the indirect resource limitation on COTS reproduction. In nature, COTS larval     
   success is partially limited by the availability of coral. Thus, we add a term so that the COTS growth rate is modulated by the average coral cover (averaging fast‐ and slow‐growing coral cover) to better capture
   boom‐bust cycles under varying coral availability.                                                                                                                                                                  
 2 New Parameter:                                                                                                                                                                                                      
   We add a new parameter (coral_effect_scaler) to provide flexibility over the strength of the coral cover’s effect on COTS growth. It has an initial value of 1.0 and includes ecological justification in its       
   description.                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 3 Changes in the Model:                                                                                                                                                                                               
   In model.cpp, we modify the COTS growth term by computing the average coral cover (from previous time steps) and normalising it to a fraction. We then multiply the original growth term by this factor (scaled by  
   the new parameter) so that lower coral cover reduces the effective growth of COTS.

 Our assessment indicates that while the current model captures logistic growth and outbreak-triggered decline for COTS, it neglects the potential feedback from coral availability on COTS reproduction. Ecologically 
 lower coral cover can reduce larval success and hence limit outbreak magnitude. We improve the model by incorporating resource limitation via an average coral cover term (from fast- and slow-growing coral) in the  
 growth equation. This change helps capture boom-bust cycles more realistically.
