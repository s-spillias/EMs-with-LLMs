Assessment and Rationale:
Residual analysis revealed that the current model underestimates the outbreak collapse when coral cover falls. In reality, as the key prey becomes scarce the COTS outbreak should dampen more rapidly. To improve ecological realism and capture the abrupt boom‚Äêbust cycles, a new parameter "coral_availability_modifier" is introduced in the model. This parameter intensifies the outbreak decline when the total coral cover (fast-growing plus slow-growing, with a maximum potential of 200) is lower, effectively representing prey scarcity effects on the outbreak dynamics.
