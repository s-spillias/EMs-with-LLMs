Overview of the changes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

 1 We have updated the intention.txt file with an assessment and rationale. Our assessment found that while the current model reasonably captures population outbreaks, the outbreak trigger mechanism is oversimplified. In particular, it does not fully account for subtle environmental influences that might dynamically alter outbreak timing and magnitude. We have therefore   
   chosen to improve the outbreak trigger function by adding an extra sensitivity term, which we call outbreak_env_sensitivity. Ecologically, this parameter quantifies how environmental conditions (in combination with COTS density relative to carrying capacity) accentuate outbreak onset. This added complexity is justified by observations of non‐linear, threshold‐like      
   outbreak dynamics in field data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 2 We add a new parameter in parameters.json (outbreak_env_sensitivity) with a clear ecological justification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 3 In model.cpp, we update the calculation of the effective outbreak trigger sharpness such that it leverages the new parameter. We now compute:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    effective_sharpness = outbreak_sharpness * (environmental_modifier + outbreak_env_sensitivity * (cots_pred[t-1] / (carrying_capacity + eps)));                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
   This ensures that only the previous time step’s values are used and that environmental effects become more pronounced with higher relative COTS density.

 1. The current model approximates outbreak dynamics with a sigmoidal outbreak trigger. However, residual analysis suggests that the timing and steepness of outbreaks are not being fully captured.                                                                                                                                                                                   
 2. Ecologically, outbreak events in COTS are known to be modulated not only by intrinsic population dynamics but also by environmental drivers (e.g. temperature anomalies, water quality).                                                                                                                                                                                           
 3. To better represent these dynamics, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_env_sensitivity", which scales the effective outbreak trigger in relation to the previous time step's COTS density relative to carrying capacity.                                                                                                                                                      
 4. This change adds a dynamic environmental sensitivity to the outbreak trigger, improving the model's ability to capture the rapid ‘boom’ phase while avoiding data leakage (only previous time step values are used).                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 These improvements should help the model better predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.

Did you mean to match some of these actual lines from POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_5ATHTFIG/model.cpp?

```
    PARAMETER(predation_scaler);

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

Below is the SEARCH/REPLACE block that will add the missing parameter declaration exactly where needed in POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_5ATHTFIG/model.cpp.
