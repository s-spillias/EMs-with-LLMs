Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
- The current model fits the data reasonably but shows systematic discrepancies in capturing the rapid escalation and abrupt collapse observed during outbreak events.
- Although the outbreak trigger accommodates resource limitation and quadratic nonlinearity, the abrupt transition appears oversimplified.
- To address this, we introduce a cubic term in the outbreak trigger, allowing a higher-order non-linear effect. This change helps to capture extreme outbreak escalation dynamics under high COTS densities, thus aligning the model closer to ecological observations of boom‚Äêbust cycles.
