Below is our proposed improvement. In summary, our assessment is that although the model captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS reasonably well, the fixed carrying capacity does not reflect how the availability of 
fast‐growing coral (Acropora spp.) limits sustainable COTS abundance. Ecologically, as coral cover declines from predation, the resource base for COTS is reduced, leading to a lower effective carrying capacity. We  
therefore add a new parameter (coral_influence_on_capacity) that modulates the carrying capacity based on the lagged fast-growing coral cover. This addition provides a feedback mechanism better matching observed    
outbreak suppression dynamics.

    • Update the logistic growth equation to calculate an effective carrying capacity based on the previous fast-growing coral cover, avoiding any use of the current time step's data.

 The current model fits the data moderately well but oversimplifies the ecological feedback between coral communities and COTS dynamics. In reality, the available fast‐growing coral (Acropora spp.) determines the   
 sustainability of high COTS densities, as coral decline reduces prey availability and thus lowers the effective carrying capacity for COTS.

 We introduce a feedback mechanism by modulating the carrying capacity. A new parameter, "coral_influence_on_capacity", is added to adjust the base carrying capacity based on the lagged value of fast-growing coral  
 cover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 This change prevents unrealistic predictions during periods of severely low coral cover and better captures the boom‐bust cycle especially during the outbreak decline phase.
