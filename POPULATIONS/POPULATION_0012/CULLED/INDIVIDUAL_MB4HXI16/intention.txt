Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
======================================
The current model fits the data moderately well but oversimplifies the ecological feedback between coral communities and COTS dynamics. In reality, the available fast‐growing coral (Acropora spp.) determines the sustainability of high COTS densities, as coral decline reduces prey availability and thus lowers the effective carrying capacity for COTS.
 
Improvement:
------------
We introduce a feedback mechanism by modulating the carrying capacity. A new parameter, "coral_influence_on_capacity", is added to adjust the base carrying capacity based on the lagged value of fast-growing coral cover. 
This change prevents unrealistic predictions during periods of severely low coral cover and better captures the boom‐bust cycle especially during the outbreak decline phase.
