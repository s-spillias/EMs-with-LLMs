Assessment:
- The model captures basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth and outbreak-triggered decline.
- Residual analysis indicates that while the outbreak timing is reasonably modeled, the coral predation dynamics are oversimplified.
- Currently, a Type II (saturating) functional response is used to model coral predation, which may overestimate predation efficiency at low coral densities.

Chosen Improvement:
- Modify the coral predation functional response in the model equations to a Holling Type III response. This is achieved by squaring coral cover values in both the numerator and denominator.
  Ecological Justification: A Holling Type III response better captures reduced predation rates at low densities (prey refuge effects), leading to more realistic dynamics in coral recovery and facilitating improved timing and magnitude estimates of COTS outbreaks.
