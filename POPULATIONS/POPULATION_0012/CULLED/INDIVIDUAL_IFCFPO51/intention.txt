Assessment and Improvement:
After analyzing the model’s residuals and comparing observed versus predicted values, we identified that the resource limitation mechanism in the COTS growth equation may be too simplistic. To improve ecological realism and capture the nonlinear effects of coral availability on COTS population dynamics, we introduce a new parameter "resource_limitation_exponent". This parameter allows the model to intensify resource limitation when coral availability is low and to saturate when coral cover is high—reflecting competitive and uptake constraints within the reef ecosystem.
