Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth with outbreak-triggered decline and coral-predation dynamics. However, the resource limitation mechanism treats coral availability using only a quadratic saturating function. This may oversimplify the ecological reality in which diminishing returns become more pronounced at higher coral cover.

Improvement:
A cubic term has been added to the resource limitation function in order to capture subtle nonlinear saturation effects. The new "cubic_coral_effect" parameter provides additional flexibility, allowing the model to better represent the complex interactions between coral cover and COTS growth when coral availability is high. This adjustment should improve the fit, particularly in cases where the observed residuals indicate under- or over-estimation of the resource-driven changes.
