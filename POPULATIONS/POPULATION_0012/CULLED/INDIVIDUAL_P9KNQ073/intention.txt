Assessment and Improvement:
----------------------------
The current model captures the general boom‚Äêbust dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) outbreaks and their predation on coral communities. However, it does not explicitly account for the resource limitation effect arising from declining coral cover. Ecologically, as coral cover (both fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites) decreases, the available food for COTS reduces, thereby limiting their growth even if intrinsic growth conditions are favourable.
  
To address this, we introduce a non-linear resource limitation mechanism by adding a new parameter, "coral_limitation_power". In the updated model, the growth rate of COTS is scaled by a factor proportional to the normalized coral availability (average of fast and slow coral cover divided by 200) raised to the power of "coral_limitation_power". This flexible formulation allows the model to capture a range of non-linear feedbacks, reflecting an ecologically plausible control on outbreak magnitudes and durations.
