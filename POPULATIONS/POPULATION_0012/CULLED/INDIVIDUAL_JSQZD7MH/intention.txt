MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
- Comprehensive COTS population dynamics with age structure
- Nutrient-mediated outbreak trigger mechanism via sigmoidal larval survival
- Temperature effects on recruitment
- Type II functional responses for selective coral predation
- Multiple mortality factors (Allee, density, food limitation)

Weaknesses Identified:
1. Independent coral carrying capacities ignore competitive space dynamics
2. No mechanism for competitive release when one coral type is depleted
3. Coral recovery after COTS decline may be unrealistic
4. Missing temporal niche partitioning between fast/slow coral strategies

Parameter Review:
- log_conversion_eff = -1.5 gives conversion_eff ≈ 0.22, which is reasonable but the growth-from-feeding mechanism may still overestimate COTS growth
- Attack rates show strong selectivity (fast: 1.65 vs slow: 0.61 m²/ind/year)
- Carrying capacities (fast: 50%, slow: 40%) sum to 90%, suggesting potential space competition not captured

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: COMPETITIVE SPACE DYNAMICS ===

Rationale:
The Great Barrier Reef benthic substrate is a limited resource. When COTS preferentially consume fast-growing Acropora, this creates competitive release for slow-growing massive corals to expand. Conversely, after COTS outbreaks decline, fast corals can rapidly recolonize freed space. This dynamic is critical for:
1. Realistic boom-bust-recovery cycles
2. Community composition shifts during/after outbreaks
3. Multi-decadal outbreak periodicity
4. Explaining why reefs don't permanently shift to slow-coral dominance

Mathematical Implementation:
Replace fixed carrying capacities with dynamic effective carrying capacities that depend on space occupancy:

K_fast_effective = K_fast_max * (1 - slow_coral / total_space)
K_slow_effective = K_slow_max * (1 - fast_coral / total_space)

Where total_space represents maximum benthic cover (typically 80-90% for healthy reefs).

This creates:
- Competitive exclusion pressure when both corals are abundant
- Competitive release when one type is depleted by COTS
- Realistic space limitation without requiring explicit competition coefficients

New Parameters:
- total_benthic_space: Maximum total coral cover (% cover), typically 80-90%
- competition_strength: Modulates how strongly each coral type inhibits the other (0-1 scale)

Modified Equations:
- Equation 15 (fast coral growth): Use K_fast_effective instead of fixed fast_carrying_cap
- Equation 18 (slow coral growth): Use K_slow_effective instead of fixed slow_carrying_cap

Expected Outcomes:
1. More realistic coral community dynamics during outbreaks
2. Faster recovery of fast corals after COTS decline (competitive release)
3. Temporary dominance shifts between coral types
4. Better representation of multi-decadal cycles
5. Improved fit to data showing coral community composition changes

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding critical ecological realism for the PROJECT CONTEXT of episodic COTS outbreaks and their impact on coral communities.
