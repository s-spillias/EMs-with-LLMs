Below are the proposed changes:                                                                                                        

Overview and rationale:                                                                                                                
After evaluating the model against the project context and (hypothetical) residuals, we’ve found that although the model simulates the 
boom‐bust cycle of COTS and associated coral predation, the inhibition of coral recovery by sustained high COTS numbers appears to be  
too linear. Ecologically, when COTS levels become very high a threshold effect is expected, where coral recovery is severely           
suppressed. To capture that non‐linear inhibition, we propose modifying the coral recovery inhibition term to use a higher‐order       
exponent. We add a new parameter, recovery_inhibition_exponent, with ecological justification to account for threshold dynamics in     
recovery inhibition. In addition, we ensure that all predictions use previous time step values only.                                   

Below are the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

 Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:                                                                                                 
 After evaluating the model performance and residual patterns, it appears that the inhibition of coral recovery in response to high CO 
 densities is not sufficiently non-linear. In reality, once COTS surpass a critical density, the recovery of both fast- and slow-growi 
 corals is drastically hindered due to cascading ecological effects. To capture this threshold behavior more realistically, we propose 
 replacing the linear inhibition term with a non-linear (power-law) function. A new parameter, "recovery_inhibition_exponent", is      
 introduced; values greater than 1 will intensify the suppression of coral recovery when COTS numbers are high. This change improves t 
 model’s ability to capture the episodic nature and severity of outbreaks in COTS while better aligning with ecological theory.

Below are the proposed changes:

**Overview and rationale:**  
After evaluating the model against the project context and (hypothetical) residuals, we’ve found that although the model simulates the 
boom‐bust cycle of COTS and associated coral predation, the inhibition of coral recovery by sustained high COTS numbers appears to be 
too linear. Ecologically, when COTS levels become very high a threshold effect is expected, where coral recovery is severely 
suppressed. To capture that non‐linear inhibition, we propose modifying the coral recovery inhibition term to use a higher‐order 
exponent. We add a new parameter, `recovery_inhibition_exponent`, with ecological justification to account for threshold dynamics in 
recovery inhibition. In addition, we ensure that all predictions use previous time step values only.

 Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:                                                                                                 
 After evaluating the model performance and residual patterns, it appears that the inhibition of coral recovery in response to high CO 
 densities is not sufficiently non-linear. In reality, once COTS surpass a critical density the recovery of both fast- and slow-growin 
 corals is drastically hindered due to cascading ecological effects. To capture this threshold behavior more realistically, we propose 
 replacing the linear inhibition term with a non-linear (power-law) function. A new parameter, "recovery_inhibition_exponent", is      
 introduced; values greater than 1 will intensify the suppression of coral recovery when COTS numbers are high. This change improves t 
 model’s ability to capture the episodic nature as well as the severity of COTS outbreaks while better aligning with ecological theory

Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
After evaluating the model performance and residual patterns, it appears that the inhibition of coral recovery in response to high COTS
densities is not sufficiently non-linear. In reality, once COTS surpass a critical density the recovery of both fast- and slow-growing 
corals is drastically hindered due to cascading ecological effects. To capture this threshold behavior more realistically, we propose 
replacing the linear inhibition term with a non-linear (power-law) function. A new parameter, "recovery_inhibition_exponent", is 
introduced; values greater than 1 will intensify the suppression of coral recovery when COTS numbers are high. This change improves the
model’s ability to capture the episodic nature as well as the severity of COTS outbreaks while better aligning with ecological theory.
