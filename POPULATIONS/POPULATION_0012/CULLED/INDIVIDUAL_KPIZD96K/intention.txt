Assessment:
The current model uses a logistic outbreak trigger that transitions gradually based solely on COTS density relative to a fixed fraction of carrying capacity. However, ecological observations indicate that COTS outbreaks typically exhibit an abrupt, non‐linear onset once a critical threshold is overcome. To address this, we introduce a new parameter "outbreak_shape" that raises both the current density and the threshold (i.e. outbreak_threshold * carrying_capacity) to a power. Values greater than 1 will sharpen the transition, making the outbreak trigger more sensitive to increases in COTS density. This improvement helps capture the rapid boom phase and better reflects the system’s inherent non-linear dynamics.
