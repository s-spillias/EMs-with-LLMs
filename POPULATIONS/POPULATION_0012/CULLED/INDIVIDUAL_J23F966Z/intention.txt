Assessment:
I evaluated the current model and found that while it reasonably captures the COTS boomâ€“bust cycles and associated coral predation,
the saturating predation term is oversimplified. Residuals indicate that the model underfits at extreme coral cover levels.
To address this, I have introduced a non-linear scaling for predation efficiency by incorporating an exponent (predation_efficiency_exponent)
into the saturating functional response. Ecologically, this reflects that predation is less effective at low coral cover but becomes more
pronounced as cover increases, thereby capturing threshold dynamics in COTS predation. This change maintains the use of only previous
time step values, preventing data leakage.
