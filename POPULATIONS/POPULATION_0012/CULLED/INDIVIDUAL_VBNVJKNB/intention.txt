Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model fits the data moderately well in capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks. However, it lacks an explicit resource limitation mechanism: the growth rate of COTS is independent of the available coral cover. Ecologically, outbreak success is closely tied to the abundance of coral prey. When coral cover is low, the food resource for COTS declines, impeding outbreak escalation. 

Chosen Improvement:
Introduce a resource limitation factor in the COTS growth term. The new factor, "coral_availability", is calculated as (fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / 200, which scales the intrinsic growth rate by the proportion of available coral. This adjustment reflects that lower coral cover limits outbreak potential.
