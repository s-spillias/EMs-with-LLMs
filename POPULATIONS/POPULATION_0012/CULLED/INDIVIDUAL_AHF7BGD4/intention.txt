MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The existing model implements a coupled COTS-coral system with:
- Temperature-dependent recruitment (Gaussian response around optimal SST)
- Multiple mortality pathways (baseline, Allee effects, density-dependence, food limitation)
- Type II functional response for selective coral predation
- Logistic growth for fast (Acropora) and slow (massive) coral groups

STRENGTHS:
- Captures basic predator-prey dynamics
- Includes temperature effects on recruitment
- Differentiates coral functional groups
- Implements Allee effects at low densities

CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:
The model lacks the PRIMARY ecological driver of COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef: nutrient-enhanced larval survival. Current literature overwhelmingly supports that terrestrial runoff carrying nutrients triggers phytoplankton blooms, which dramatically increase larval COTS survival during their planktonic phase (2-3 weeks). This is the key mechanism that transforms background larval immigration into explosive outbreak events.

Current recruitment equation:
  recruitment = cots_recruit_base * cotsimm_dat * temp_response

This treats larval immigration as a simple forcing variable with temperature modulation, but misses the critical SURVIVAL component that depends on food availability for larvae.

=== PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT ===

IMPROVEMENT: Nutrient-mediated larval survival amplification

Add a non-linear nutrient response function that modulates larval survival based on environmental conditions that promote phytoplankton productivity. Since direct nutrient data may not be available, we can use SST anomalies and seasonal patterns as proxies for conditions associated with runoff events (cooler water during wet season).

NEW MECHANISM:
Larval survival is enhanced when conditions favor phytoplankton blooms. We implement this as a saturating response to environmental favorability:

  nutrient_proxy = exp(-nutrient_sensitivity * (sst_dat - sst_bloom_optimal)Â²)
  larval_survival = larval_survival_base / (1 + exp(-nutrient_steepness * (nutrient_proxy - nutrient_threshold)))
  
  recruitment = cots_recruit_base * cotsimm_dat * temp_response * larval_survival

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Phytoplankton blooms occur during specific temperature/nutrient windows (often cooler, wet season conditions)
2. Larval COTS survival increases dramatically (10-100x) when phytoplankton food is abundant
3. This creates the non-linear amplification needed to generate episodic outbreaks from background immigration
4. The sigmoidal response captures threshold behavior: small nutrient increases have little effect until a critical level is reached

MATHEMATICAL FORM:
- Gaussian component: Captures optimal environmental window for blooms
- Logistic component: Creates threshold response and saturation at high favorability
- Multiplicative interaction: Larval survival amplifies recruitment only when both immigration and environmental conditions align

This addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT requirement to capture "mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events" by adding the well-documented nutrient-larval survival pathway that is absent from the current model.

PARAMETER ADDITIONS:
- log_larval_survival_base: Baseline larval survival multiplier (log scale)
- log_nutrient_sensitivity: Sensitivity to environmental conditions for bloom formation
- sst_bloom_optimal: Optimal SST for phytoplankton bloom conditions (typically cooler than adult optimal)
- log_nutrient_steepness: Steepness of threshold response
- nutrient_threshold: Threshold environmental favorability for enhanced survival

Expected outcome: Model will now be able to generate episodic outbreaks when environmental conditions align with larval immigration pulses, rather than showing proportional responses to immigration forcing.
