Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

Residual analysis indicates that the outbreak trigger function is overly sensitive to short‐term fluctuations in the COTS population, which can lead to unrealistic boom–bust cycles. To address this, we introduced a new parameter "memory_effect" that implements an ecological memory: outbreak triggering now uses a weighted average of the COTS population from the previous two time steps. This delays the outbreak response, reflecting the natural inertia of population dynamics in the reef ecosystem.
