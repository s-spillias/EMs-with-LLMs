The current model uses a linear saturation in the effect of fast-growing coral cover on COTS growth. However, the transition from low to high coral cover may be better represented non-linearly. To capture a         
threshold response—where below a certain coral cover the effect is minimal, but above it, the resource availability boosts COTS growth substantially—we add a Hill function. This is achieved by introducing a new     
parameter, growth_curve_shape, which acts as a Hill coefficient. A value greater than 1 (e.g., 2.0) will provide a steeper response. This addition more accurately represents ecological reality under resource-limited
conditions and better fits the observed boom-bust dynamics.

 Assessment and Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                           
 The current model fits the observed boom-bust dynamics of COTS reasonably well but employs a linear saturation function for the influence of fast-growing coral on COTS growth. Given episodic outbreaks, a sharper   
 threshold response may better capture the transition in resource availability. By introducing a Hill coefficient (growth_curve_shape), we allow the model to transition more abruptly from low to high effects as cor 
 cover increases, thus reflecting non-linear resource limitation in the reef ecosystem. This improvement aligns with ecological feedbacks where small changes in coral cover can trigger significant shifts in starfis 
 reproduction.
