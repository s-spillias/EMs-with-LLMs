Assessment and Improvement:
The current model fits the observed boom-bust dynamics of COTS reasonably well but employs a linear saturation function for the influence of fast-growing coral on COTS growth. Given episodic outbreaks, a sharper threshold response may better capture the transition in resource availability. By introducing a Hill coefficient (growth_curve_shape), we allow the model to transition more abruptly from low to high effects as coral cover increases, thus reflecting non-linear resource limitation in the reef ecosystem. This improvement aligns with ecological feedbacks where small changes in coral cover can trigger significant shifts in starfish reproduction.
