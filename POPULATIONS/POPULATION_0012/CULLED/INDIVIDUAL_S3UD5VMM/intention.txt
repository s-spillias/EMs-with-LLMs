Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
- Assessment: The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS reasonably well, but residuals suggest that the outbreak decline phase is not as steep as observed in nature.
- Reasoning: In natural systems, once COTS exceed a critical threshold, rapid bust-phase transitions are often observed. To reflect this, we propose an additional non-linear term.
- Chosen Improvement: Introduce an "additional_decline_exponent" parameter that is applied in the outbreak decline dynamics when COTS exceed the outbreak threshold. This change accelerates the decline during outbreak bust phases and better captures the ecological feedback mechanisms.
