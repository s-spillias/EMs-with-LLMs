 1 intention.txt: We add a detailed assessment outlining that while the current model captures general boom‐bust dynamics, the outbreak decline phase appears oversimplified. We now propose an accelerated (non‐linear) decline once the COTS population exceeds a threshold. This change better reflects the rapid bust observed in nature.                                          
 2 parameters.json: We add a new parameter, additional_decline_exponent, to allow the outbreak decline exponent to increase when the COTS population is above the outbreak threshold. This extra exponent term captures the accelerated bust-phase.                                                                                                                                    
 3 model.cpp: In the loop, we replace the existing outbreak trigger and decline calculations with new code that first computes the excess population above threshold. Then, if excess > 0 the decline is computed with an extra exponent (i.e. using outbreak_decline_exponent + additional_decline_exponent), otherwise the original formulation is retained. This ensures that only  
   when COTS exceed their threshold will the model invoke an accelerated decline.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 - Assessment: The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS reasonably well, but residuals suggest that the outbreak decline phase is not as steep as observed in nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 - Reasoning: In natural systems, once COTS exceed a critical threshold, rapid bust-phase transitions are often observed. To reflect this, we propose an additional non-linear term.                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 - Chosen Improvement: Introduce an "additional_decline_exponent" parameter that is applied in the outbreak decline dynamics when COTS exceed the outbreak threshold. This change accelerates the decline during outbreak bust phases and better captures the ecological feedback mechanisms.
