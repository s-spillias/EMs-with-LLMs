Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
Residual analysis indicates that the current model tends to overestimate early outbreak growth. One plausible ecological explanation is the absence of an Allee effect: at very low densities, Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) may have difficulty finding mates or benefit from group behaviors, leading to reduced growth. By introducing an "allee_threshold" parameter, we allow the model to incorporate density-dependent inhibition at low population sizes. This change helps improve outbreak timing and magnitude predictions while capturing the natural threshold effect in population dynamics.
