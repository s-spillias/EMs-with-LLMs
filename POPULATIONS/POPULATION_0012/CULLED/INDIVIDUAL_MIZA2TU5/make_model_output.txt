Below is our plan based on the project context. In our assessment we found that while the model already captures many key processes, it
falls short on representing the persistent impact of high COTS densities on coral recovery. In nature, sustained high COTS numbers may 
cause lasting coral damage that delays or slows coral recovery non‐linearly. To capture this effect, we propose replacing the current  
linear inhibition (using coral_recovery_inhibition) with an exponential decay in the coral recovery terms using a new parameter called 
coral_damage_factor. This parameter will scale the reduction in recovery rate as a non‐linear function of previous COTS abundance. This
adjustment not only aligns with the observed boom–bust cycles but also provides a more realistic feedback between COTS outbreaks and   
coral recovery. No current time step response values are used in the updated calculation, ensuring no data leakage.

 The current model does a good job capturing the basic outbreak dynamics. However, residual analyses indicate that recovery of coral   
 (both fast and slow-growing) may be overestimated following high COTS outbreaks, suggesting that the model underestimates persistent  
 coral damage. To address this, we introduce an exponential decay factor in the coral recovery terms. This modification, regulated by  
 new parameter `coral_damage_factor`, reduces the effective recovery rate as COTS densities increase, better capturing the delayed and 
 reduced recovery observed in the data.

Below is our plan based on the project context. In our assessment we found that while the model already captures many key processes, it
falls short on representing the persistent impact of high COTS densities on coral recovery. In nature, sustained high COTS numbers may 
cause lasting coral damage that delays or slows coral recovery non‐linearly. To capture this effect, we propose replacing the current 
linear inhibition (using coral_recovery_inhibition) with an exponential decay in the coral recovery terms using a new parameter called 
`coral_damage_factor`. This parameter will scale the reduction in recovery rate as a non‐linear function of previous COTS abundance. 
This adjustment not only aligns with the observed boom–bust cycles but also provides a more realistic feedback between COTS outbreaks 
and coral recovery. No current time step response values are used in the updated calculation, ensuring no data leakage.

 The current model does a good job capturing the basic outbreak dynamics. However, residual analyses indicate that recovery of coral   
 (both fast and slow-growing) may be overestimated following high COTS outbreaks, suggesting that the model underestimates persistent  
 coral damage. To address this, we introduce an exponential decay factor in the coral recovery terms. This modification, regulated by  
 new parameter `coral_damage_factor`, reduces the effective recovery rate as COTS densities increase, better capturing the delayed and 
 reduced recovery observed in the data.
