Assessment:
The current model does a good job capturing the basic outbreak dynamics. However, residual analyses indicate that recovery of coral (both fast and slow-growing) may be overestimated following high COTS outbreaks, suggesting that the model underestimates persistent coral damage. To address this, we introduce an exponential decay factor in the coral recovery terms. This modification, regulated by a new parameter `coral_damage_factor`, reduces the effective recovery rate as COTS densities increase, better capturing the delayed and reduced recovery observed in the data.
