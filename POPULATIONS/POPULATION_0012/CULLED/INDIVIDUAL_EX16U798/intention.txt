My assessment of the current model is as follows:
1. The model captures the general dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their impact on coral communities, but residual analysis indicates that the predation losses on fast-growing coral are underpredicted when coral cover is high.
2. While key processes (logistic growth, outbreak-triggered decline, saturating predation responses) are modeled, the system omits an important ecological mechanism: a refuge effect for fast-growing coral. In nature, high coral cover can provide structural complexity that buffers against predation.
3. To address this, I propose incorporating a refuge mechanism into the fast-growing coral dynamics by introducing a logistic factor that mitigates predation when coral cover exceeds a threshold (controlled by the new parameters coral_refuge_threshold and coral_refuge_steepness).

This enhancement is expected to improve predictions of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration by better capturing the feedback between coral cover and predation pressure.
