Below are the proposed changes:                                                                                                        

 1 We update the intention.txt with our assessment and reasoning for incorporating a coral refuge mechanism into the fast-growing coral
   predation dynamics. This modification is intended to capture the observed mis‐fit in residuals at high coral cover and is           
   ecologically justified by the expectation that high coral cover provides structural refuge, reducing effective predation.           
 2 We add two new parameters to parameters.json—coral_refuge_threshold and coral_refuge_steepness—with clear ecological justifications 
   for representing a refuge effect.                                                                                                   
 3 In model.cpp, we update the fast-growing coral dynamics. We first compute a logistic refuge factor (using the new parameters) that  
   reduces the effective predation when the fast-growing coral cover is high, then apply this factor to modify the predation decline   
   term. This change preserves the correct use of previous time step values.

 =======                                                                                                                               
 My assessment of the current model is as follows:                                                                                     
 1. The model captures the general dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their impact on coral communities, but residual analysis indicates   
 that the predation losses on fast-growing coral are underpredicted when coral cover is high.                                          
 2. While key processes (logistic growth, outbreak-triggered decline, saturating predation responses) are modeled, the system omits an 
 important ecological mechanism: a refuge effect for fast-growing coral. In nature, high coral cover can provide structural complexity 
 that buffers against predation.                                                                                                       
 3. To address this, I propose incorporating a refuge mechanism into the fast-growing coral dynamics by introducing a logistic factor  
 that mitigates predation when coral cover exceeds a threshold (controlled by the new parameters coral_refuge_threshold and            
 coral_refuge_steepness).                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                       
 This enhancement is expected to improve predictions of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration by better capturing the feedback      
 between coral cover and predation pressure.
