Assessment: The current model captures COTS outbreak dynamics with logistic growth and a smooth outbreak-triggered decline fixed at 50% of the carrying capacity. Residual analysis indicates that the outbreak initiation may vary more dynamically. Hence, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_threshold", to allow the model to flexibly determine the fraction of carrying capacity at which outbreak decline is triggered. Ecologically, this represents variation in resource competition and environmental influences on outbreak dynamics.
