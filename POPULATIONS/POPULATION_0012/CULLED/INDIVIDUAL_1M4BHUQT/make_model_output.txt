Below is our proposed update. We introduce a new parameter, outbreak_threshold, so that the outbreak-triggered decline is governed by a flexible fraction of the carrying capacity rather than a fixed 50%. This change
is ecologically justified because ecological threshold levels may vary according to resource limitation and competition. The new parameter and its effect on the outbreak trigger function should improve the accuracy 
of the predicted outbreak timing and magnitude.

 Assessment: The current model captures COTS outbreak dynamics with logistic growth and a smooth outbreak-triggered decline fixed at 50% of the carrying capacity. Residual analysis indicates that the outbreak       
 initiation may vary more dynamically. Hence, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_threshold", to allow the model to flexibly determine the fraction of carrying capacity at which outbreak decline is triggered.   
 Ecologically, this represents variation in resource competition and environmental influences on outbreak dynamics.
