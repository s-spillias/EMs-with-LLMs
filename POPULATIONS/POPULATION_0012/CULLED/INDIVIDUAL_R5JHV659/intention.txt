Project Assessment:
The current model is able to capture the boom-bust dynamics of COTS via logistic growth and outbreak trigger functions. However, an inspection of the residuals indicates that the model may under‐ or over‐estimate outbreak magnitude depending on coral availability. Ecologically, sustained outbreak growth requires a minimum coral cover because COTS rely on coral prey for nutrition. When coral cover falls below a threshold, reduced food availability should limit outbreak growth.
Chosen Improvement:
We add an indirect feedback mechanism by computing a new factor ("coral_growth_factor") that modulates the intrinsic COTS growth rate based on total coral cover (sum of fast- and slow-growing corals). This factor is computed with a logistic function parameterized by two new parameters: "coral_threshold" (minimum coral cover to sustain high growth) and "coral_effect_steepness" (controls the sensitivity of the growth reduction below the threshold). This addition increases ecological realism by capturing reduced outbreak growth when coral prey become scarce.
