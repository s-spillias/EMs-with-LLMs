Assessment and Improvement:
The current model uses logistic growth and a sharp outbreak trigger to simulate COTS dynamics, and a linear predation term on corals. While it captures boom‐bust cycles, residual analysis suggests that when COTS numbers are high, the model overestimates coral losses. This indicates that per‐capita predation may saturate under high COTS density.
We have therefore introduced a saturating functional response in the coral predation term. This change reflects the ecological reality that predation efficiency diminishes as COTS abundance increases, due to limitations like handling time and resource availability.
