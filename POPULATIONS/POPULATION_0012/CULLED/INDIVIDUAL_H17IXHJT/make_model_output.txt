Below are the proposed changes. I've chosen to improve how coral losses are modeled by introducing a saturating functional response to COTS predation. Ecologically, as starfish become highly abundant, their         
per‐capita predation should plateau due to limitations such as handling time. We add a new parameter (predation_saturation) in parameters.json with clear justification and update the coral equations in model.cpp    
accordingly. We also update intention.txt with a summary of the assessment and rationale.

 Assessment and Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                           
 The current model uses logistic growth and a sharp outbreak trigger to simulate COTS dynamics, and a linear predation term on corals. While it captures boom‐bust cycles, residual analysis suggests that when COTS   
 numbers are high, the model overestimates coral losses. This indicates that per‐capita predation may saturate under high COTS density.                                                                                
 We have therefore introduced a saturating functional response in the coral predation term. This change reflects the ecological reality that predation efficiency diminishes as COTS abundance increases, due to       
 limitations like handling time and resource availability.

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc

Below is the revised SEARCH/REPLACE block. This block adds a declaration for predation_saturation immediately after the existing observed_sd declaration. The SEARCH block exactly matches the corresponding line in
