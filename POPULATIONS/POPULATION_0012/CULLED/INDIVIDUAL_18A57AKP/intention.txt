Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

After evaluating the model, we find that while the outbreak dynamics of COTS are well represented, the model’s formulation for coral recovery is oversimplified. In natural reef systems, fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites spp.) corals compete for limited space and resources. This competitive interaction can hinder the recovery of each group when the other is abundant.

To address this, we have introduced a competition term into the coral recovery equations. The effective recovery gap for each coral group is reduced by a factor proportional to the other group’s cover, scaled by a new parameter "competition_coefficient". This term (with a proposed default value of 0.1) captures the idea that high cover of one coral type suppresses the recovery potential of the other, reflecting realistic ecological interactions.
