Below is our proposed ecological improvement. In our assessment we noted that while the outbreak dynamics are well captured, the recovery of coral is potentially oversimplified. In rich reef environments, fast‐growing and slow‐growing coral groups compete for space, effectively reducing each other’s net recovery. We propose to add a competition mechanism into the recovery 
equations where the effective recovery gap for each coral group is reduced by the presence of the other group. We introduce a new parameter, competition_coefficient, with an ecologically justified default (e.g. 0.1) that represents the intensity of competition between the two coral groups. This improvement is expected to better capture the resource competition and indirect
feedbacks between coral types in the context of COTS outbreaks.

 3 In model.cpp, update the coral recovery equations so that fast-growing coral recovery depends not only on its gap to full cover (100%) but is further reduced by the current state of slow-growing coral and vice versa.

 After evaluating the model, we find that while the outbreak dynamics of COTS are well represented, the model’s formulation for coral recovery is oversimplified. In natural reef systems, fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites spp.) corals compete for limited space and resources. This competitive interaction can hinder the recovery of each group wh 
 the other is abundant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, we have introduced a competition term into the coral recovery equations. The effective recovery gap for each coral group is reduced by a factor proportional to the other group’s cover, scaled by a new parameter "competition_coefficient". This term (with a proposed default value of 0.1) captures the idea that high cover of one coral type suppresses the    
 recovery potential of the other, reflecting realistic ecological interactions.
