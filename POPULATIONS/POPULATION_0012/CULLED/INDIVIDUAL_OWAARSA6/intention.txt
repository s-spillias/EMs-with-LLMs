Assessment:
1. The current model captures COTS outbreak dynamics and coral responses but applies a constant predation efficiency.
2. In reality, predation efficiency should decline when coral cover is low because COTS have reduced success in locating sparse prey.
3. This resource limitation mechanism is oversimplified in the current formulation.

Improvement:
- Introduce a new parameter "half_saturation_coral_cover" to model resource limitation on coral predation.
  This parameter determines the coral cover level at which predation efficiency is half its maximum.
- Update the model equations to compute effective predation efficiency as:
    effective_efficiency = coral_predation_efficiency * (coral_cover / (coral_cover + half_saturation_coral_cover))
  
Ecological Justification:
- The modification reflects the ecological reality: when coral cover is low, the search efficiency of COTS decreases, thereby reducing overall predation pressure.
- This enhancement improves the modelâ€™s representation of outbreak dynamics while keeping additional complexity minimal.
