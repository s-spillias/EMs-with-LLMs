Below is our step‐by‐step plan and the necessary changes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

 1 Assessment and Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
    • Assessment: The model currently reproduces the outbreak curves but its resource limitation mechanism is rather oversimplified. The saturating function for coral availability uses a fixed Michaelis–Menten formulation. However, the influence of coral cover on COTS growth may be more non‐linear than assumed.                                                               
    • Chosen Improvement: We propose to introduce a new parameter, resource_exponent, which will exponentiate the coral availability in the saturating function. In this way, we can flexibly modulate how sensitive COTS growth is to changes in coral cover. Ecologically, if this exponent is greater than one, it amplifies the non‐linear response and can help capture threshold 
      effects in resource uptake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
    • Implementation:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
      a) Update the intention.txt file with this assessment and rationale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
      b) In the C++ model (model.cpp), add a new parameter resource_exponent and update the resource limitation calculation by replacing:

 The current model adequately captures the timing and magnitude of the COTS outbreak cycles, but the resource limitation mechanism is oversimplified. Currently, the saturating function for coral availability has a fixed nonlinearity that may not flexibly capture the ecological dynamics.

 Introduce a new parameter "resource_exponent" to exponentiate the coral availability in the Michaelis–Menten-like function. This allows the model to capture a variable non-linear response of COTS growth to coral cover, reflecting threshold effects and more realistic resource uptake under low or high coral conditions.

 A resource_exponent > 1 amplifies the effect of coral availability changes on COTS growth, better capturing potential threshold dynamics in resource uptake and competition. This adjustment improves the model's fidelity to the observed boom-bust cycles while avoiding data leakage by using only lagged state variables.

After applying these changes, you may want to run the model to check if the additional non-linearity improves the fit and better captures the observed outbreak dynamics.
