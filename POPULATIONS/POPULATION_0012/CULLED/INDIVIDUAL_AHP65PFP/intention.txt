Assessment:
The current model adequately captures the timing and magnitude of the COTS outbreak cycles, but the resource limitation mechanism is oversimplified. Currently, the saturating function for coral availability has a fixed nonlinearity that may not flexibly capture the ecological dynamics. 

Proposed Improvement:
Introduce a new parameter "resource_exponent" to exponentiate the coral availability in the Michaelisâ€“Menten-like function. This allows the model to capture a variable non-linear response of COTS growth to coral cover, reflecting threshold effects and more realistic resource uptake under low or high coral conditions. 

Ecological Justification:
A resource_exponent > 1 amplifies the effect of coral availability changes on COTS growth, better capturing potential threshold dynamics in resource uptake and competition. This adjustment improves the model's fidelity to the observed boom-bust cycles while avoiding data leakage by using only lagged state variables.
