Assessment:
The current model captures many important outbreak and coral-predation processes but oversimplifies the coral recovery dynamics. In natural systems, when fast-growing coral cover is very low an Allee effect may slow recovery due to reduced recruitment and competitive constraints. To address this, we introduce a new parameter, `allee_effect_exponent`, which nonlinearly scales the gap to maximum cover (i.e. (100 - coral_cover) raised to an exponent). Values greater than 1 will cause recovery to be slower at intermediate levels of coral cover, reflecting ecological feedbacks and recruitment failure. This change should help improve the modelâ€™s ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events.
