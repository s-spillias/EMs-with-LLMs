Assessment and Reasoning:
The model generally captures the boom-bust cycles but underestimates the rapid onset of outbreaks. 
The current outbreak trigger uses a standard logistic function that may oversimplify critical ecological feedbacks.
To improve realism, we introduce a higher-order nonlinear amplification: by computing the excess of COTS (from the previous time step) above the outbreak threshold and raising it to an exponent (excess_exponent), even small exceedances can trigger disproportionately large outbreak effects.
This change better reflects the sudden, explosive dynamics observed in outbreak events.
