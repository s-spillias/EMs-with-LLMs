Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
- The current model uses logistic growth for COTS and simple saturating functions for coral predation.
- While it effectively captures boom-bust dynamics, the linear saturating term for predation does not fully capture potential non-linear threshold effects observed in real ecosystems.
- We propose adding a new parameter "predation_exp" to allow a flexible, non-linear predation efficiency. This parameter modifies the saturating function (using a power transformation) to reflect that predation efficiency may escalate sharply once coral cover passes a threshold.
- This adjustment better represents ecological complexity in predator-prey interactions, enhancing the model's ability to simulate the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events.
