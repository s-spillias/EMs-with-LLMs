Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model reasonably captures the observed boom‐bust cycles in COTS populations and their impact on coral cover. However, the resource limitation mechanism—implemented as a quadratic saturating function—appears oversimplified given the complex nonlinearities observed in ecological resource uptake.
To better represent these dynamics, we are replacing the quadratic function with a Hill function. This improvement captures a more realistic saturating response to coral availability, where below a threshold, resource uptake is strongly limited and then saturates at higher coral cover. The new parameters "resource_limitation_exponent" and "resource_limitation_half" quantify the steepness and half‐saturation point of this response. This non‐linear formulation is expected to improve the accuracy of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration predictions.
