Assessment:
The current model moderately fits the observed boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks but lacks a detailed non-linear resource limitation mechanism. The outbreak timing and magnitude are captured reasonably; however, the effect of coral availability on COTS growth is oversimplified by a linear adjustment.

Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter "resource_limitation_exponent" to allow a non-linear (power-law) response of COTS growth to coral availability. This parameter models diminishing returns in resource uptake when coral cover is low, reflecting the ecological reality of resource depletion and competition. This enhancement should better capture the dynamics of outbreak initiation and decline.

Note:
All predictions use lagged (previous time step) values to avoid data leakage.
