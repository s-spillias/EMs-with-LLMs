Assessment:
-------------
Based on the residuals analysis, the current model tends to underestimate the onset of COTS outbreaks and does not adequately capture the threshold behavior associated with coral-provided resources.
To address this, the model is improved by introducing a nonlinear saturating effect of fast-growing coral cover on COTS growth. A new parameter, "coral_half_saturation", represents the coral cover level
at which the positive effect on COTS growth is half of its maximum. This change better captures resource limitation dynamics and the ecological threshold effects, ensuring that when coral cover is low,
even small increases significantly boost COTS growth, but the effect saturates at higher coral cover.
