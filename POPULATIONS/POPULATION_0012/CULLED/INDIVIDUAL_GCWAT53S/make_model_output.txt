Below is the plan and the proposed changes:                                                                                                                                                                            

 1 Intention update: We update intention.txt to document that after evaluating the residuals and model performance, the model underestimates the onset of outbreaks. To address this, we introduce a nonlinear         
   saturation (a Hill‐type function) into how fast-growing coral cover influences COTS growth. Ecologically, this represents that when coral cover is low, increases to coral cover have a large positive effect on    
   COTS growth, but the effect saturates as cover increases. This addresses resource limitation and a more realistic nonlinear response.                                                                               
 2 New parameter addition: We add a new parameter, coral_half_saturation, into parameters.json to represent the half-saturation constant (in percentage) for the effect of fast-growing coral cover on COTS growth.    
 3 Model code changes:                                                                                                                                                                                                 
    • In model.cpp, we insert a new parameter definition for coral_half_saturation among the PARAMETER declarations.                                                                                                   
    • We then modify the calculation of effective_growth_rate to use a saturating function based on the available fast-growing coral cover rather than using the linear term (fast_pred[t-1] / 100.0).                 
    • We also add the eps constant in the denominator for numerical stability.

 Based on the residuals analysis, the current model tends to underestimate the onset of COTS outbreaks and does not adequately capture the threshold behavior associated with coral-provided resources.                
 To address this, the model is improved by introducing a nonlinear saturating effect of fast-growing coral cover on COTS growth. A new parameter, "coral_half_saturation", represents the coral cover level            
 at which the positive effect on COTS growth is half of its maximum. This change better captures resource limitation dynamics and the ecological threshold effects, ensuring that when coral cover is low,             
 even small increases significantly boost COTS growth, but the effect saturates at higher coral cover.
