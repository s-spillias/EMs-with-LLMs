Assessment and Improvement:
- The current model fits outbreak phases reasonably well, but residual patterns indicate that coral decline is underestimated.
- The predation term is oversimplified; a simple linear fraction does not capture threshold effects where low coral cover may result in disproportionately reduced predation efficiency due to refuges.
- To address this, a non-linear Hill function is introduced into the coral predation equations. The new parameter "hill_coefficient" governs the steepness of this response, reflecting potential ecological thresholds in coral predation by COTS.
