Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

The current model effectively captures the general boom‐bust dynamics of COTS populations using logistic growth and an outbreak trigger. However, the ecological process of interference competition among crown-of-thorns starfish—where increasing density limits per‐individual predation efficiency on coral—has not been explicitly accounted for. This can lead to overestimation of coral decline during outbreaks.

To address this, we introduce the parameter "interference_competition" to reduce the effective coral predation efficiency when COTS densities become high. This modification aligns with the project context by incorporating an important density‐dependent feedback mechanism, and we ensure only previous time step values are used in predictions.
