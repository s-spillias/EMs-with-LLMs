Assessment and Ecological Improvement:
1. The current model fits the data reasonably well but shows minor deviations in outbreak timing and magnitude when comparing residuals.
2. While the model captures boom-bust cycles and selective predation on coral communities, the simple Michaelis–Menten form used for coral resource limitation may oversimplify the non‐linear feedbacks.
3. To address this, we now use a Hill function (with exponent 2) for coral resource limitation. This offers a more flexible, non-linear representation, better reflecting the diminishing returns in COTS growth as coral cover increases.
4. Overall, this modification aims to improve the model’s ability to predict outbreak dynamics by incorporating a higher-order ecological response.
