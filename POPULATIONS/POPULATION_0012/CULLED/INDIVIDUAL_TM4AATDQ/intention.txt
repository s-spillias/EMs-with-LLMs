Project Assessment and Improvement:
-------------------------------------
The current model simulates COTS dynamics with logistic growth modified by a resource limitation term based on coral availability and a logistic outbreak trigger.
However, residual analyses have suggested that while the timing of outbreaks is captured reasonably, the magnitude and speed of the outbreak phase are sometimes underpredicted.
Ecologically, aside from resource constraints, environmental factors (e.g. temperature anomalies) can sharply accelerate COTS growth leading to rapid outbreaks.
To address this, we introduce a new parameter "growth_environmental_modifier" which explicitly scales the intrinsic growth rate.
This reflects field observations that environmental conditions can modulate outbreak intensity, offering improved alignment with the observed boom-bust cycles.
