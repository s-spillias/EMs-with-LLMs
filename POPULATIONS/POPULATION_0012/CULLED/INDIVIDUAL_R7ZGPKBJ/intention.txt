Assessment:
The residuals indicate that the current model oversimplifies resource dynamics by only considering fast-growing coral cover in modulating COTS growth. Observations suggest that during outbreaks, a reduction in both fast- and slow-growing coral may limit available resources for COTS, slowing outbreak acceleration. Therefore, the model has been improved to incorporate a resource limitation mechanism by using the average of fast and slow coral cover as a proxy for resource availability. This adjustment better captures the eco-dynamics of boom-bust cycles in COTS outbreaks.
