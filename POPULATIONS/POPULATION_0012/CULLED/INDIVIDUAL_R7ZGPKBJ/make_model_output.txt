Below is the plan based on our assessment:                                                                                                                                                                             

 • Assessment & Reasoning (intention.txt): Residual analysis suggests that the model underestimates the impact of reduced coral cover during outbreak phases. The current formulation only uses fast-growing coral     
   cover to modulate the COTS growth rate. However, past outbreaks may reduce both fast‐ and slow-growing coral, limiting resource availability for COTS and thus slowing subsequent outbreak acceleration. To capture 
   this resource limitation, the effective growth rate is now modified to use the average of fast and slow coral cover. This change better reflects how overall coral availability regulates COTS growth and aligns the
   model with key ecological processes.                                                                                                                                                                                
 • Model Refinement (model.cpp):                                                                                                                                                                                       
   We update the effective growth rate calculation for COTS. Instead of using only fast-growing coral (Acropora spp.) as a proxy for resource availability to enhance growth, we now use the combined average of fast- 
   and slow-growing coral cover. This ensures that both types of coral, which provide habitat or food resources, modulate the population dynamics.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 The residuals indicate that the current model oversimplifies resource dynamics by only considering fast-growing coral cover in modulating COTS growth. Observations suggest that during outbreaks, a reduction in bot 
 fast- and slow-growing coral may limit available resources for COTS, slowing outbreak acceleration. Therefore, the model has been improved to incorporate a resource limitation mechanism by using the average of fas 
 and slow coral cover as a proxy for resource availability. This adjustment better captures the eco-dynamics of boom-bust cycles in COTS outbreaks.
