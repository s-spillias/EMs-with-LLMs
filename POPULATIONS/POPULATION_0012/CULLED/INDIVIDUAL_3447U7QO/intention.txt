This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It incorporates environmental drivers—such as sea-surface temperature and larval immigration—to trigger rapid population increases leading to outbreak events. The model captures boom-bust dynamics by integrating saturating resource limitations, smooth threshold responses, and dynamic feedback loops between COTS and coral communities (fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites). Predictions are computed without using current time step observations to avoid data leakage.
