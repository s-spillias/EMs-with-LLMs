Assessment and Rationale:
The current model captures COTS outbreak and coral decline reasonably well but omits a key feedback mechanism â€“ when coral cover declines, reduced prey availability should limit COTS population growth. To address this, we introduce a resource limitation effect into the logistic growth of COTS. The new mechanism scales the growth rate using the predicted coral covers (fast and slow) from the previous time step, reflecting reduced food resources when coral is scarce. This improvement better captures the ecological dynamics behind boom-bust outbreak cycles.
