 1 Intention File: We document our assessment and rationale. The current model lacks feedback between coral prey availability and COTS growth. Our improvement introduces a resource‐limitation factor that scales the 
   COTS logistic growth by the combined coral cover from the previous time step, ensuring that low coral availability reduces COTS growth.                                                                             
 2 Model Code (model.cpp):                                                                                                                                                                                             
   • We add a new parameter, resource_limitation, to control the strength of the coral feedback on COTS growth.                                                                                                        
   • We then modify Equation 1 so that the logistic growth term is modulated by a food availability factor computed from previous fast and slow coral predictions.

 The current model captures COTS outbreak and coral decline reasonably well but omits a key feedback mechanism – when coral cover declines, reduced prey availability should limit COTS population growth. To address  
 this, we introduce a resource limitation effect into the logistic growth of COTS. The new mechanism scales the growth rate using the predicted coral covers (fast and slow) from the previous time step, reflecting   
 reduced food resources when coral is scarce. This improvement better captures the ecological dynamics behind boom-bust outbreak cycles.

After applying these changes, you can rebuild and run the model to assess how well adding the resource limitation improves the ecological realism and fit to the observed data.
