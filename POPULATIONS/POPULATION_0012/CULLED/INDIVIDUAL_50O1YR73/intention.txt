PROJECT INTENTION & ASSESSMENT:
After evaluating the model's fit and its ability to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks, it appears that while the current model includes logistic growth, resource limitation, and environmental modifiers, the outbreak trigger mechanism relies solely on COTS abundance relative to a fixed threshold. However, ecological theory indicates that outbreak initiation is also strongly influenced by the availability of coral prey. Plentiful coral cover can facilitate rapid starfish proliferation, whereas depleted coral cover may moderate outbreak expression even when COTS densities are near the threshold.
To address this, we have introduced a new parameter, "coral_outbreak_modifier", which modulates the outbreak trigger by scaling the effective sharpness based on coral availability. This added mechanism provides a more dynamic and ecologically realistic representation of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
