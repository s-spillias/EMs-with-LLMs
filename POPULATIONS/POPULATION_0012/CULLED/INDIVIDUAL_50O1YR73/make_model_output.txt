Below is our planned update. We are going to add a new ecological feedback mechanism to link the outbreak trigger to the available     
coral cover. In our assessment we determined that—even though the current model incorporates resource‐limitation in the COTS growth—the
outbreak trigger itself is driven solely by COTS density. Ecologically, abundant coral cover can help drive outbreak initiation        
(providing ample food), whereas depleted coral cover may delay or temper the outbreak even if COTS are near threshold. To incorporate  
this reasoning we                                                                                                                      

 1 Update intention.txt to document our assessment and reasoning.                                                                      
 2 Add a new parameter coral_outbreak_modifier to parameters.json with ecological justification.                                       
 3 Update model.cpp so that the outbreak trigger now includes a multiplier based on the coral availability calculated from the previous
   time step.

 PROJECT INTENTION & ASSESSMENT:                                                                                                       
 After evaluating the model's fit and its ability to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks, it appears that    
 while the current model includes logistic growth, resource limitation, and environmental modifiers, the outbreak trigger mechanism    
 relies solely on COTS abundance relative to a fixed threshold. However, ecological theory indicates that outbreak initiation is also  
 strongly influenced by the availability of coral prey. Plentiful coral cover can facilitate rapid starfish proliferation, whereas     
 depleted coral cover may moderate outbreak expression even when COTS densities are near the threshold.                                
 To address this, we have introduced a new parameter, "coral_outbreak_modifier", which modulates the outbreak trigger by scaling the   
 effective sharpness based on coral availability. This added mechanism provides a more dynamic and ecologically realistic representati 
 of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
