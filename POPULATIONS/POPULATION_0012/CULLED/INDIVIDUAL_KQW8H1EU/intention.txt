Assessment and Improvement:
The current model uses logistic growth with an outbreak trigger based solely on a linear threshold mechanism, which reasonably captures the boom‐bust cycles of COTS but may oversimplify the transition to outbreak states. Ecologically, outbreak initiation can be driven by non‐linear feedbacks once the COTS density exceeds a critical threshold. To better capture this behavior, we introduce an additional quadratic (non‐linear) term in the exponent of the outbreak trigger function, controlled by a new parameter "outbreak_nonlinearity". This change allows for a steeper, more abrupt outbreak onset that aligns with observed patterns in nature.
