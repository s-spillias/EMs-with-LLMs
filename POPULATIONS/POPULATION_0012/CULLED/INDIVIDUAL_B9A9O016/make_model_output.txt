Below is my proposed plan and rationale:                                                                                                                                                                               

Assessment and Proposed Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                   

 1 Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                         
    • The model generally captures the boom‐bust cycle of COTS using a logistic growth and outbreak trigger. However, key feedback between coral prey availability and starfish population growth is missing.          
    • Residuals indicate that unexplained variation may be due to the omission of coral‐driven resource limitation on COTS growth when coral cover is depleted.                                                        
 2 Proposed Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                               
    • Add a new parameter, prey_influence, that acts as a multiplier in the COTS growth equation reflecting the effect of combined coral cover (both fast and slow-growing) on starfish population dynamics.           
    • Update the model so that the intrinsic growth is further modulated by a factor proportional to the available coral. This feedback loop is ecologically justified: abundant coral can bolster COTS growth, while  
      low coral cover dampens it.

    • Add a new parameter prey_influence with an initial value of 1.0 and detailed ecological justification.

    • Update the COTS growth term in the loop to include the new feedback: multiply the original term by prey_influence * ((fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / 200). The denominator (200) serves as a normalising     
      constant representing the approximate maximum coral cover in percentage.

 The current model does a reasonable job capturing the rapid increase and subsequent decline in COTS populations via logistic growth and an outbreak trigger. However, the model does not yet account for the importan 
 ecological feedback whereby coral prey availability modulates COTS population growth. The residuals suggest that when coral cover is low, the standard logistic form may overestimate COTS growth.                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Proposed Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 ---------------------                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 Incorporate a feedback mechanism where the combined available coral cover (fast and slow-growing) scales the intrinsic COTS growth rate. We introduce a new parameter `prey_influence` to represent the enhancement ( 
 limitation) of growth due to prey availability. When coral cover is high, COTS growth is boosted; when coral cover is low, growth is dampened. This change captures key indirect dynamics in the system.
