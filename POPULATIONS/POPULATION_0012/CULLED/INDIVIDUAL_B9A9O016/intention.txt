Assessment:
-----------
The current model does a reasonable job capturing the rapid increase and subsequent decline in COTS populations via logistic growth and an outbreak trigger. However, the model does not yet account for the important ecological feedback whereby coral prey availability modulates COTS population growth. The residuals suggest that when coral cover is low, the standard logistic form may overestimate COTS growth.

Proposed Improvement:
---------------------
Incorporate a feedback mechanism where the combined available coral cover (fast and slow-growing) scales the intrinsic COTS growth rate. We introduce a new parameter `prey_influence` to represent the enhancement (or limitation) of growth due to prey availability. When coral cover is high, COTS growth is boosted; when coral cover is low, growth is dampened. This change captures key indirect dynamics in the system.
