Assessment and Improvement:

1. The current model successfully captures the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and their predation on coral. However, the resource limitation imposed by coral availability is represented using a relatively linear formulation.
2. Ecological evidence suggests that as coral cover declines, the effect on COTS growth can be abrupt (i.e. threshold‐based), indicating a non-linear dependence.
3. To address this, we have introduced a Hill function in the resource limitation term. This adjustment incorporates two new parameters: 
   - "hill_coefficient": controls the non-linearity (steepness) of the response.
   - "coral_half_saturation": the coral availability level at which the effect is half its maximum.
4. This enhancement aligns with reported threshold effects, offering a more realistic depiction of the feedback of coral cover on outbreak dynamics.
