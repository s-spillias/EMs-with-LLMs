Revised Model Intention and Assessment:
The current model captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth combined with a smooth outbreak-triggered decline. However, residual analyses indicate systematic mismatches during outbreak phases, suggesting a missing feedback mechanism.
Assessment and Chosen Improvement:
- Ecologically, the availability of coral (a key food resource) affects COTS growth. High coral cover enhances feeding and reproduction, while low coral availability limits population growth.
- To address this, we introduce a resource-limitation feedback by incorporating coral cover (the sum of fast and slow coral predictions from the previous time step) into the COTS growth equation through a new parameter, `coral_availability_effect`.
- The growth term is multiplied by a resource factor: 
  resource_factor = 1 + coral_availability_effect * (((fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / 200.0) - 0.5)
This non-linear feedback better captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events in relation to coral availability.
