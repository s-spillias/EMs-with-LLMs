Below is our plan to incorporate an ecologically motivated resource‐limitation mechanism. We will update the intention.txt file with our assessment, add a new parameter (coral_availability_effect) to parameters.json
with a clear ecological justification, and modify model.cpp so that the COTS growth term is scaled by a factor computed from the previous time step’s coral predictions (the sum of fast and slow coral cover). The    
resource factor is defined as                                                                                                                                                                                          

resource_factor = 1 + coral_availability_effect * (((fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / 200.0) - 0.5)                                                                                                                  

This ensures that when the combined coral cover is higher than 100 (out of a possible 200), the COTS growth is enhanced, and when low, growth is reduced. These changes add an indirect feedback consistent with the   
project’s emphasis on outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration while avoiding the use of current time step observations.

 Revised Model Intention and Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                               
 The current model captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth combined with a smooth outbreak-triggered decline. However, residual analyses indicate systematic mismatches during   
 outbreak phases, suggesting a missing feedback mechanism.                                                                                                                                                             
 Assessment and Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                    
 - Ecologically, the availability of coral (a key food resource) affects COTS growth. High coral cover enhances feeding and reproduction, while low coral availability limits population growth.                       
 - To address this, we introduce a resource-limitation feedback by incorporating coral cover (the sum of fast and slow coral predictions from the previous time step) into the COTS growth equation through a new      
 parameter, `coral_availability_effect`.                                                                                                                                                                               
 - The growth term is multiplied by a resource factor:                                                                                                                                                                 
   resource_factor = 1 + coral_availability_effect * (((fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / 200.0) - 0.5)                                                                                                               
 This non-linear feedback better captures the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events in relation to coral availability.
