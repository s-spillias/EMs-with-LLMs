Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
Residual analysis indicates that although the model’s logistic growth with a smooth outbreak trigger captures the basic boom‐bust dynamics of COTS, it oversimplifies the ecological reality by not incorporating bottom‐up control.
In natural systems, the availability of coral (both fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites) is a key limiting resource for COTS growth.
To address this, we introduce a resource limitation mechanism by scaling the COTS growth term with the combined coral cover (fast + slow) relative to a maximum potential (assumed 200% total coral cover).
A new parameter, "resource_modifier", is added to allow tuning of this effect.
This change improves realism by ensuring that low coral cover dampens COTS growth, thereby better matching observed residuals.
