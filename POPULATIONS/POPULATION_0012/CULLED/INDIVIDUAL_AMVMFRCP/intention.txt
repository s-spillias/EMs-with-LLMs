Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model captures basic outbreak dynamics using logistic growth and a trigger based on linear and quadratic terms. However, residual analysis suggests that the rapid onset and abrupt collapse of outbreaks are not fully captured. We propose adding a cubic term in the outbreak trigger function. This additional non-linear component can better represent threshold behavior and abrupt transitions observed in Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks, reflecting complex density-dependent feedbacks. This ecological refinement enhances the realism in predicting outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration without compromising the use of only previous time step values.
