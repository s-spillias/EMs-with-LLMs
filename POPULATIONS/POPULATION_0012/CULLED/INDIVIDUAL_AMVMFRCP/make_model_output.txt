Below are the proposed changes. We will:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

 1 Update the intention.txt file with our ecological assessment and reasoning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 2 Add a new parameter “outbreak_cubic” into parameters.json with an ecological justification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 3 Update model.cpp so that the outbreak trigger function incorporates a cubic term (using the new parameter) for additional non‐linear density dependence. This enhances the flexibility of the outbreak onset and maintains proper use of only previous time step values.

 The current model captures basic outbreak dynamics using logistic growth and a trigger based on linear and quadratic terms. However, residual analysis suggests that the rapid onset and abrupt collapse of outbreaks are not fully captured. We propose adding a cubic term in the outbreak trigger function. This additional non-linear component can better represent threshold    
 behavior and abrupt transitions observed in Crown-of-Thorns outbreaks, reflecting complex density-dependent feedbacks. This ecological refinement enhances the realism in predicting outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration without compromising the use of only previous time step values.

Fixing broken model iteration: 0
Below is the change required to declare the outbreak_cubic parameter in model.cpp. We will insert a new parameter declaration right after outbreak_quad and before outbreak_decline_exponent.                                                                                                                                                                                          

Please review and confirm the changes.
