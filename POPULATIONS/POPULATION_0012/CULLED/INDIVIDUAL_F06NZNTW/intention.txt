Assessment and Improvement Plan:

1. Model Fit & Context: The current model captures the broad boom-bust dynamics and selective coral predation but relies on a simple Michaelis–Menten function for coral resource limitation. Residuals indicate that outbreak timing and magnitude can be sensitive to abrupt changes in coral availability.

2. Ecological Reasoning: Ecologically, when coral cover drops below a critical threshold, COTS growth may be more strongly limited due to reduced prey availability. A higher‐order (non‐linear) representation of resource limitation better captures these threshold responses in food availability.

3. Proposed Improvement: Introduce a new parameter, "resource_limitation_order", that governs the non‐linearity of the resource limitation effect. The COTS growth term will then use pow(resource_factor, resource_limitation_order) as an effective resource factor. This adjustment allows greater flexibility in fitting the outbreak dynamics observed in the data.
