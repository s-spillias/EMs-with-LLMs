Below is my proposal. I have chosen to improve the resource‐limitation mechanism in the COTS growth equation. In the current model the effect of coral availability is incorporated via a Michaelis–Menten saturating function. However, the response may be more strongly non‐linear than currently represented. Ecologically, when coral cover falls below a critical threshold, food
limitation can exert a strong, non‐linear effect on predator (COTS) growth. To capture that, I am introducing a new parameter, resource_limitation_order, which raises the resource factor to a power. This added non‐linearity allows the model to better capture abrupt switches in resource availability and their effect on outbreak dynamics.                                     

Below are the changes to be made:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

 1 Update the intention file to document the assessment and rationale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 2 Add a new parameter resource_limitation_order to parameters.json with clear ecological justification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 3 Update the COTS growth equation in model.cpp so that it uses the new parameter to compute an effective resource factor.

 1. Model Fit & Context: The current model captures the broad boom-bust dynamics and selective coral predation but relies on a simple Michaelis–Menten function for coral resource limitation. Residuals indicate that outbreak timing and magnitude can be sensitive to abrupt changes in coral availability.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 2. Ecological Reasoning: Ecologically, when coral cover drops below a critical threshold, COTS growth may be more strongly limited due to reduced prey availability. A higher‐order (non‐linear) representation of resource limitation better captures these threshold responses in food availability.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 3. Proposed Improvement: Introduce a new parameter, "resource_limitation_order", that governs the non‐linearity of the resource limitation effect. The COTS growth term will then use pow(resource_factor, resource_limitation_order) as an effective resource factor. This adjustment allows greater flexibility in fitting the outbreak dynamics observed in the data.
