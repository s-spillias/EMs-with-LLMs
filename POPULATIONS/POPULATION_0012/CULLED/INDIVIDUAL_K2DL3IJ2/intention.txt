Assessment and Model Improvement:
-----------------------------------
Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS and their selective predation on coral communities. However, using a constant predation efficiency does not account for the reduced encounter rate when coral cover is low, potentially overestimating predation impact during severe coral depletion.

Improvement:
We introduce a variable predation efficiency feedback mechanism. The effective predation efficiency is now computed as the product of the constant coral_predation_efficiency, a new parameter predation_effect_scaler, and the ratio of the coral cover (fast or slow) to 100. This adjustment ensures that when coral cover declines, the effective predation rate decreases accordingly.

Ecological Justification:
This feedback mechanism reflects the ecological reality where low coral availability limits COTS predation success, thus better capturing outbreak dynamics.
