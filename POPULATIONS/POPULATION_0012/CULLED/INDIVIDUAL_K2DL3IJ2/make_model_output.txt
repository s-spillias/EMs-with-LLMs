Below is the plan and our corresponding changes:                                                                                                                                                                       

 1 Assessment and Rationale (intention.txt):                                                                                                                                                                           
   We explain that while the current model captures boom‐bust cycles, it uses a constant coral predation efficiency, which may overestimate predation when coral cover is low. To more realistically capture dynamics, 
   we add a variable predation efficiency feedback that scales with coral cover. This is ecologically justified by the decreased encounter rate when prey (coral) are scarce.                                          
 2 New Parameter (parameters.json):                                                                                                                                                                                    
   We add a new parameter named predation_effect_scaler that multiplies the existing coral predation efficiency by a factor proportional to the coral cover. This enables the effective predation rate to drop when    
   coral cover is low.                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 3 Mathematical Implementation (model.cpp):                                                                                                                                                                            
   In both coral equations, we update the predation term so that effective efficiency becomes                                                                                                                          
   coral_predation_efficiency * predation_effect_scaler * (coral_cover/Type(100))                                                                                                                                      
   where coral_cover is fast_pred[t-1] for fast-growing corals and slow_pred[t-1] for slow-growing corals. This modification avoids using current time step data while introducing a feedback mechanism based solely on
   the previous state.

 The current model reasonably captures the boom-bust cycles of COTS and their selective predation on coral communities. However, using a constant predation efficiency does not account for the reduced encounter rate 
 when coral cover is low, potentially overestimating predation impact during severe coral depletion.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 We introduce a variable predation efficiency feedback mechanism. The effective predation efficiency is now computed as the product of the constant coral_predation_efficiency, a new parameter predation_effect_scale 
 and the ratio of the coral cover (fast or slow) to 100. This adjustment ensures that when coral cover declines, the effective predation rate decreases accordingly.                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Ecological Justification:                                                                                                                                                                                             
 This feedback mechanism reflects the ecological reality where low coral availability limits COTS predation success, thus better capturing outbreak dynamics.

Did you mean to match some of these actual lines from POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_K2DL3IJ2/parameters.json?

```
