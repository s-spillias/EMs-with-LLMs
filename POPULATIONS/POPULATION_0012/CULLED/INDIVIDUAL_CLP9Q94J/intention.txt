Assessment and improvement notes:
1. The current model employs logistic growth for COTS with an outbreak trigger based solely on COTS abundance, which oversimplifies the ecological interplay between COTS and coral availability.
2. Residual analysis indicated that outbreak timing is not well captured.
3. To better represent the system dynamics, we now incorporate a resource limitation into the outbreak trigger by including coral cover feedback. A new parameter, "coral_saturation", is introduced to model a half-saturation constant for this effect. High coral cover increases outbreak susceptibility, while low coral cover delays outbreak onset.
4. This modification improves the modelâ€™s fidelity in capturing the boom-bust cycles of COTS by aligning with ecological evidence on the role of coral availability.
