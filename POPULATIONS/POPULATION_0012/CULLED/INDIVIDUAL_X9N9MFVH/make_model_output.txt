Below are the proposed changes. I have chosen to add an additional cubic term (new parameter outbreak_cubic) to the outbreak trigger function. This higher‐order term introduces flexibility to capture hysteresis and abrupt regime shifts in outbreak initiation, which are ecologically plausible given the observed boom–bust dynamics. The updated intention file documents that  
while the current model fits the data reasonably, the outbreak onset is sometimes too smooth. Adding a cubic term will better capture rapid regime shifts. This change is supported by ecological reasoning and should enable more flexible outbreak trigger dynamics.

 The current model fits the data moderately well but tends to smooth over the abrupt onset and decline observed during COTS outbreaks. Although the outbreak trigger currently includes a quadratic term, this may limit the ability to capture rapid regime shifts or hysteresis in outbreak initiation. By incorporating a cubic term, we can allow for sharper transitions when     
 thresholds are reached. This reflects ecological realities where critical thresholds lead to sudden outbreaks, and thus improves the model’s representation of boom–bust cycles.
