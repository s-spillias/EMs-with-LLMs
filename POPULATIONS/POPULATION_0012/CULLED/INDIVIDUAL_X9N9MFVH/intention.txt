Assessment:
The current model fits the data moderately well but tends to smooth over the abrupt onset and decline observed during COTS outbreaks. Although the outbreak trigger currently includes a quadratic term, this may limit the ability to capture rapid regime shifts or hysteresis in outbreak initiation. By incorporating a cubic term, we can allow for sharper transitions when thresholds are reached. This reflects ecological realities where critical thresholds lead to sudden outbreaks, and thus improves the model’s representation of boom–bust cycles.
