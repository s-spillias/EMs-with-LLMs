Assessment and Model Improvement Rationale:

The current model captures the episodic outbreak dynamics of COTS and their predation on coral, but the recovery rates for fast‐ and slow‐growing corals are fixed (0.1 and 0.05, respectively). This simplification does not reflect known environmental influences (e.g. temperature, water quality, nutrient availability) that can facilitate or hinder coral recovery. Residual analysis suggests that the model underestimates coral recovery under favorable conditions.

To improve ecological realism, I have introduced an environmental modifier parameter, "coral_recovery_modifier", which scales the recovery contributions. This allows the model to dynamically adjust coral recovery based on environmental conditions, offering a more flexible and robust representation of the boom‐bust cycles observed in the Great Barrier Reef.
