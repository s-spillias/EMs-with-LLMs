Assessment:
The current model uses a logistic growth form and a smooth outbreak-triggered decline, modulated by a linear environmental_modifier. However, environmental influences that drive outbreak thresholds may be nonâ€‘linear in nature. By adding a quadratic term (environmental_nonlinearity) to the outbreak trigger, the model can better represent accelerated thresholds under environmental stress. This change will help capture abrupt transitions in outbreak onset, in line with ecological observations on episodic COTS dynamics.
