Assessment:
The current model simulates the boom-bust dynamics of COTS reasonably well; however, the outbreak trigger function solely depends on COTS abundance. This oversimplifies the ecological reality where healthy coral cover can enhance reef resilience and delay outbreak initiation. 

Improvement:
Introduce an indirect feedback mechanism into the outbreak trigger by adding a new parameter, "coral_outbreak_inhibition". This parameter scales the negative effect of high combined coral cover on the outbreak trigger. Ecologically, a greater total coral cover (fast + slow) should inhibit or delay outbreak onset by reflecting a more resilient reef system.

Changes:
- Add "coral_outbreak_inhibition" to parameters.json with an expert-justified value.
- Modify the outbreak trigger expression in model.cpp to subtract a term proportional to normalized coral cover.
