Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures the general outbreak burst and subsequent decline by using logistic growth and saturating predation terms. However, the predation efficiency is modeled via a linear saturation function, which may fail to reflect threshold effects in coral predationâ€”namely, the rapid increase in predation impact when coral cover surpasses a critical threshold.

Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, "predation_exponent," and modify the coral predation term in both the fast-growing and slow-growing coral equations. The updated term applies a non-linear power law (pow(..., predation_exponent)) to the predation efficiency factor. This enhancement reflects ecological evidence that, beyond a threshold, increased coral cover leads to a disproportionally higher predation rate on corals by COTS. Furthermore, the change adheres to best practices by ensuring that only previous time step predictions (e.g., fast_pred[t-1] and slow_pred[t-1]) are used in the calculation, avoiding data leakage.
