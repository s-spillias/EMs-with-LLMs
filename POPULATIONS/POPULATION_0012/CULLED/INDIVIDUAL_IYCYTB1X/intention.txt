This model assessment indicates that while the current approach adequately captures the rapid outbreak and subsequent decline of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS), residual analysis suggests that growth at low densities is underestimated. This behavior points to a potential ecological Allee effect—where reproduction and aggregation are limited at low densities—that is not yet incorporated. 

To address this, an Allee effect multiplier is added to the COTS growth equation: 
    allee = 1 - exp(-allee_sensitivity * cots_pred[t-1]);
This multiplier reduces growth when populations are very low and allows full growth only as densities increase. 

A new parameter 'allee_sensitivity' (default value 2.0) is introduced in parameters.json to govern this effect. This adjustment is ecologically justified as it captures critical mate-finding/aggregation limits that can delay outbreak onset.
