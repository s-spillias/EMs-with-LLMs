Assessment:
The current model effectively captures the outbreak dynamics using logistic growth and a smooth outbreak-triggered decline mechanism. However, observations suggest that outbreak initiation may be driven by non-linear environmental influences that compound when COTS density exceeds a critical threshold. To address this, a quadratic term is now introduced in the outbreak trigger function via a new parameter "environmental_modifier2". This refinement allows the model to capture amplified outbreak responses under stressed environmental conditions while avoiding data leakage by only using previous time step values.
