Assessment and Proposed Improvement:
1. The current model captures basic logistic growth and outbreak-triggered decline of COTS, with predation effects on corals.
2. However, residuals indicate that the rapid outbreak phase tends to be underpredicted.
3. To better capture the sharp onset of outbreaks, we introduce an "outbreak_boost" factor that amplifies COTS growth at high densities. This reflects positive density-dependent processes such as increased mating efficiency.
4. This enhancement adds a quadratic-like term to the growth equation, improving the modelâ€™s ability to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
