Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model reproduces the boom-bust dynamics of COTS but uses an outbreak trigger that depends solely on COTS density.
2. Ecologically, outbreak initiation should also be sensitive to coral availability, since low coral cover can limit the resources needed for sustained outbreaks.
3. This update incorporates coral availability into the outbreak trigger by modulating the effective sharpness, thereby better reflecting the ecological feedback between coral cover and COTS outbreaks.
