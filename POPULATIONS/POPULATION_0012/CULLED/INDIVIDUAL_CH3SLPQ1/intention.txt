Assessment and Rationale:
The current model effectively captures the outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) and their predation on coral. However, the coral recovery process is modeled using a simple linear gap-based formulation, which does not account for density-dependent resource limitations. In natural systems, coral recovery slows as cover approaches saturation due to competition and resource constraints.
To address this, the recovery terms for both fast- and slow-growing corals have been revised to incorporate logistic growth. This change, along with the introduction of two new parameters (coral_recovery_rate_fast and coral_recovery_rate_slow), provides a more ecologically realistic portrayal of coral recovery dynamics.
