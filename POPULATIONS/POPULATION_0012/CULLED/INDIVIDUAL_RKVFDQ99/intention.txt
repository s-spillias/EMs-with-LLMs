Assessment and Improvement Justification:
The current model captures the boom‐bust outbreak cycles and impacts on coral communities well using logistic growth, outbreak‐triggered decline, and saturating recovery functions. However, one key process that may be oversimplified is the effect of coral depletion on COTS mortality. In nature, when coral cover falls below a critical level (here, 30%), reduced prey availability can cause additional starvation-induced mortality in COTS. To capture this mechanism, a new parameter “coral_depletion_modifier” has been introduced to scale the outbreak decline when coral availability is low. This modification reinforces the negative feedback in the model, ensuring that severe coral depletion further accelerates COTS decline, thereby improving the ecological realism of the outbreak dynamics.
