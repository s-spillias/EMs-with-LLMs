Assessment:
Based on evaluation of model residuals, the current model’s outbreak trigger – which depends only on COTS density – appears to oversimplify the complex ecological dynamics. In reality, high fast-growing coral cover can provide abundant prey for COTS, potentially intensifying outbreak initiation. To capture this indirect feedback mechanism, we introduce a new parameter "coral_feedback" that modulates the outbreak trigger based on the deviation of coral cover from a threshold (here, 50%). This improvement adds ecological realism by linking prey availability (coral cover) with outbreak dynamics.
