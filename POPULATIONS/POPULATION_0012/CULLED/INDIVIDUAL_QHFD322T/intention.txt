Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
1. The current model captures key dynamics (logistic growth, outbreak-triggered decline, and coral-predation dynamics), but its outbreak trigger uses a fixed 50% of carrying capacity as the threshold.
2. This fixed threshold may not be flexible enough to capture the observed variability in outbreak timing and magnitude.
3. To better represent the complex interplay in outbreak dynamics, we introduce an "outbreak_threshold" parameter. This parameter defines the proportion of carrying capacity at which the outbreak decline kicks in.
4. This improvement allows the model to dynamically adjust the outbreak trigger based on calibrated data, aligning better with the observed boom-bust cycles.
