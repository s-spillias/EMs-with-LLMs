Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. Evaluation: The current model fits the data moderately well; however, the residuals indicate systematic misfits at high coral cover levels.
2. Issue: The coral recovery process is modeled linearly (i.e., proportional to (100 - coral cover)) which oversimplifies the recovery dynamics when near saturation.
3. Improvement: To better capture the plateau in coral recovery due to space limitation and competitive effects, we now use a quadratic recovery term. Specifically, recovery is modified to ((100 - coral_cover) * (100 - coral_cover) / 100), which slows the recovery as coral cover approaches 100%.
4. Ecological Rationale: As coral cover increases the effective growth rate should decline due to spatial limitations and competition, leading to a more realistic leveling off of recovery, thereby improving the model's ability to capture the outbreak boom-bust cycles of COTS.
