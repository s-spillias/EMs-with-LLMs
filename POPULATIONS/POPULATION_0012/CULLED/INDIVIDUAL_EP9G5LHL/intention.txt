Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model uses a simple linear environmental modifier (1 + 0.1*sst_dat) to influence COTS dynamics.
Residual analysis indicates systematic deviations during high sea-surface temperature (SST) periods, suggesting that a threshold effect might be at play.
Outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish are often triggered by extreme environmental conditions. 
We introduce a threshold-based SST trigger by adding two parameters:
 - sst_threshold: The critical SST (Â°C) above which outbreak dynamics become enhanced.
 - sst_boost: An additional growth factor applied when SST exceeds this threshold.
This improvement better captures the abrupt onset and magnitude of outbreak events, aligning with ecological observations.
