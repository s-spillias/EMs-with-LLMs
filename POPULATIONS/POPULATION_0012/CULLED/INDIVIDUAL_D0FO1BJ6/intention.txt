Assessment:
After reviewing the residuals and the current model representation, the model reliably captures the overall outbreak dynamics but appears to oversimplify one key aspect: density‐dependent intraspecific competition among Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS). In nature, when COTS densities near the carrying capacity, competition for limited resources (including available prey/coral) likely suppresses growth further than the simple logistic term indicates. 

Improvement:
To better capture the boom‐bust cycles and the rapid collapse of outbreaks observed in ecological data, we introduce a new parameter `cots_competition` that modulates growth by reducing net increase when COTS numbers are high. This addition, while modest, adds an ecologically justified non-linearity that helps improve the prediction’s timing and magnitude of outbreaks.
