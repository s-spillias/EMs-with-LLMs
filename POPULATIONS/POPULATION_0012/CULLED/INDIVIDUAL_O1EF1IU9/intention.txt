Assessment:
The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS through logistic growth and a smooth outbreak-triggered decline. However, it does not account for the depletion of coral resourcesâ€”a key ecological process driving outbreak busts. Without linking food availability to COTS growth, the model may overpredict outbreak persistence.

Chosen Improvement:
We introduce a resource limitation mechanism by modulating COTS growth with the combined cover of fast- and slow-growing corals (expressed as a fraction). A new parameter, "resource_scaler", adjusts the strength of this feedback. This ensures that when coral cover declines, reduced food availability naturally limits COTS growth, leading to more ecologically consistent boom-bust cycles.

Note: Only previous time step values for coral cover are used to prevent data leakage.
