Assessment and Improvement:
1. The current model fits the data moderately well, but the decline phase after outbreaks is not captured sharply enough.
2. While the model addresses the characteristic boom-bust cycles and includes several environmental and non-linear outbreak trigger mechanisms, the impact of coral availability on COTS growth is oversimplified.
3. To better represent the rapid decline in COTS numbers when coral resources become scarce, we introduce a higher-order non-linear response in the resource limitation mechanism.
   The new parameter "coral_limitation_exponent" allows the model to more dramatically reduce growth when coral cover is critically low, reflecting realistic rapid food limitation effects.
