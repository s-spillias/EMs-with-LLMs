Assessment and Improvement:
The current model successfully captures the general boom‐bust dynamics of COTS and the associated coral recovery processes. However, one key ecological process appears to be missing: interference among COTS individuals at high population densities. In nature, very high densities of COTS can lead to interference during coral predation, which reduces each individual’s effective predation rate. To incorporate this effect, we introduce a new parameter, "predator_interference", that modulates the effective coral predation efficiency using a saturating function. This change improves the realism of the model by depicting reduced per capita predation at high COTS densities without using current observation values in the prediction calculations.
