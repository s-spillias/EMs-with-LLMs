Assessment:
The current model captures the basic dynamics of COTS outbreaks, but the residuals suggest that the influence of coral availability on outbreak triggering is underestimated. 
Chosen Improvement:
Incorporate a non-linear effect of coral availability in the outbreak trigger function by raising it to a new exponent. This adjustment reflects the hypothesis that small differences in available coral can lead to disproportionate changes in outbreak initiation.
Changes:
- Added the parameter "coral_availability_exponent" to parameters.json with a default value of 2.0.
- Updated the outbreak trigger in model.cpp to use a non-linear scaling of coral availability.
