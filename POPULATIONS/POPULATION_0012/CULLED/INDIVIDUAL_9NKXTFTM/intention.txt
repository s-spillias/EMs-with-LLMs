Assessment:
The current model captures the basic boom-bust dynamics between COTS and coral communities. However, residual analyses reveal that the model underestimates outbreak intensity under extreme environmental conditions. The linear treatment of the `environmental_modifier` likely oversimplifies complex ecological feedbacks during extreme events.

Improvement:
We add an `extreme_outbreak_modifier` parameter to nonlinearly amplify the outbreak trigger sensitivity when environmental conditions are unusual. This reflects that factors such as temperature anomalies can sharply enhance outbreak onset. The added complexity is justified by the need to better capture the rapid escalation observed during extreme conditions.
