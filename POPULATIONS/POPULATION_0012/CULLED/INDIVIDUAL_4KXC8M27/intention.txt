Assessment:
The current model captures the boom-bust outbreak dynamics of COTS and its predation on coral communities reasonably well; however, some ecological processes are oversimplified. One key improvement is to account for variable predation efficiency through dynamic handling time. Observations suggest that in areas with higher coral availability, predators experience reduced handling time due to improved foraging efficiency. Therefore, we introduce a new parameter, handling_time_modifier, to modulate the effective handling time based on coral availability. This change provides a more realistic portrayal of the feedback between coral abundance and predation pressure, improving the model's capacity to simulate outbreak timing and severity.
