Below are the proposed changes based on our assessment. We decided that a more nuanced, nonlinear outbreak trigger can capture threshold effects in outbreak initiation. In particular, adding a quadratic (polynomial)
term to the outbreak trigger function should better represent the ecological nonlinearity that drives explosive COTS population growth when a critical density is exceeded. Consequently, we are adding a new          
parameter, poly_outbreak_coeff, with a clear ecological justification.

 Our assessment indicates that while the current model captures the general boom-bust dynamics of COTS, the outbreak‐trigger mechanism may benefit from a more nuanced, nonlinear representation. Incorporating a      
 quadratic term in the outbreak trigger function can better capture threshold effects, where small increases above a critical COTS density lead to explosive population growth. This improvement introduces the new    
 parameter 'poly_outbreak_coeff' to represent the strength of this quadratic effect and offers added flexibility to fit observed residual patterns without significantly increasing model complexity.
