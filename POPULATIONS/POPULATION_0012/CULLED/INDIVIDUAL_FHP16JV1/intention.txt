Our assessment indicates that while the current model captures the general boom-bust dynamics of COTS, the outbreak‚Äêtrigger mechanism may benefit from a more nuanced, nonlinear representation. Incorporating a quadratic term in the outbreak trigger function can better capture threshold effects, where small increases above a critical COTS density lead to explosive population growth. This improvement introduces the new parameter 'poly_outbreak_coeff' to represent the strength of this quadratic effect and offers added flexibility to fit observed residual patterns without significantly increasing model complexity.
