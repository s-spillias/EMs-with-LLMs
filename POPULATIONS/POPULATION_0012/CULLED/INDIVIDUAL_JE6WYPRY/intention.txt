Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
The current model fits the observed boomâ€“bust patterns of COTS outbreaks well, with explicit logistic growth and an outbreak trigger mechanism. However, ecological feedback from coral cover on the decline phase is missing. In degraded systems with low coral cover, outbreak decline may be less effective due to diminished predator activity or other indirect stabilising feedback mechanisms. 

To address this, we introduce a new parameter `cots_decline_feedback` that adjusts the decline term based on previous time step coral availability. This modification ensures that when coral cover is low, the decline in COTS numbers is reduced, reflecting a persistence of outbreak conditions under degraded reef systems.
