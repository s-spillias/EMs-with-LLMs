Below is our proposed improvement and the accompanying changes:                                                                        

Assessment & Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                       
The current model reasonably represents boom‐bust cycles by using logistic growth and a smooth outbreak trigger. However, the          
ecological dynamics may be further improved by accounting for feedback from coral cover on the decline phase of the COTS outbreak.     
Specifically, when coral cover is low the decline (or bust) phase may be slowed because of reduced indirect feedback mechanisms (e.g.  
lowered predation or other factors) typical in degraded reef systems. To capture this, we add a new parameter cots_decline_feedback    
that modulates the outbreak decline rate in relation to the available coral cover (using previous time step predictions only). This    
change introduces a density‐dependent feedback where lower coral availability reduces the effective decline rate, potentially leading  
to more persistent outbreaks under degraded conditions.

 Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:                                                                                                 
 The current model fits the observed boom–bust patterns of COTS outbreaks well, with explicit logistic growth and an outbreak trigger  
 mechanism. However, ecological feedback from coral cover on the decline phase is missing. In degraded systems with low coral cover,   
 outbreak decline may be less effective due to diminished predator activity or other indirect stabilising feedback mechanisms.         
                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, we introduce a new parameter `cots_decline_feedback` that adjusts the decline term based on previous time step coral 
 availability. This modification ensures that when coral cover is low, the decline in COTS numbers is reduced, reflecting a persistenc 
 of outbreak conditions under degraded reef systems.
