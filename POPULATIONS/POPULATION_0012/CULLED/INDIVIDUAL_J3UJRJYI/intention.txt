Assessment and Improvement Notes:
After evaluating the model and residuals, we concluded that the existing outbreak trigger—using a simple sigmoidal function of the previous COTS population—is oversimplified. A non-linear (second-order) adjustment can better capture the rapid escalation observed in COTS outbreaks. This improvement is ecologically justified because outbreak initiation may accelerate non-linearly as the population exceeds a critical threshold relative to the carrying capacity, reflecting sudden ecosystem changes. To implement this, we introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_nonlinearity", which modulates the curvature of the outbreak trigger function.
