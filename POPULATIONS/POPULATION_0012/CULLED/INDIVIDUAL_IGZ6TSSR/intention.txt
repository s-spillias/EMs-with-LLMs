Assessment:
The current model uses a Michaelis–Menten formulation for the effect of coral availability on COTS growth. However, the residuals suggest that the timing and magnitude of the outbreak events are not optimally captured. 
A meaningful ecological improvement is to sharpen the non-linear response of COTS growth to coral availability using a higher-order (polynomial) term. This better reflects ecological thresholds where coral cover boosts population growth dramatically up to a saturation point. 
We introduce a new parameter, "coral_half_saturation", to define the half-saturation constant of this response. The resource factor is now computed as:
    resource_factor = (coral_availability^2) / (coral_half_saturation + coral_availability^2)
This adjustment is expected to improve the model’s ability to capture boom-bust outbreak dynamics under variable coral cover conditions.
