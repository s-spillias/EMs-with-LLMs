Assessment and Improvement:
1. The current model captures logistic growth with outbreak-triggered decline but underestimates the rapid initiation of COTS outbreaks.
2. Residual analysis indicates that outbreak onset is more abrupt than predicted.
3. To address this, we introduce an Allee effect, whereby COTS growth is suppressed when densities are below a critical threshold (allee_threshold) and enhanced once this threshold is exceeded.
4. This adjustment offers a mechanistic explanation for the rapid boom observed in the data while preserving the resource limitation and outbreak decline dynamics.

Change Summary:
- Added a new parameter 'allee_threshold' to capture the minimum density for positive feedback.
- Modified the COTS growth formulation in model.cpp to include an Allee-factor multiplier.
