Below is our proposed improvement. We add a quadratic amplification factor in the outbreak trigger––only active when the COTS population exceeds the outbreak threshold––to capture non‐linear, positive feedback dynamics (e.g. behavioral aggregation) that lead to rapid outbreak escalation. We also add a new parameter, outbreak_amplification, to control the strength of this  
non-linearity. This change is ecologically justified as it better simulates the rapid transition into outbreak conditions described in our PROJECT CONTEXT.

 The current model fits the data reasonably well overall but oversimplifies outbreak dynamics by using a single logistic function based solely on COTS population relative to a threshold. This approach does not capture the positive feedback mechanisms (such as aggregation behavior and reduced predation) that can abruptly drive outbreak escalation.

 We introduce a quadratic amplification factor to the outbreak trigger. When the COTS abundance exceeds the outbreak threshold (a fraction of the carrying capacity), the outbreak trigger is nonlinearly amplified. This improves the representation of the rapid onset and high magnitude of outbreak events observed ecologically.
