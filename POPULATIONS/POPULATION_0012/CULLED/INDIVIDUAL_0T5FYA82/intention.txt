Assessment:
-----------
The current model fits the data reasonably well overall but oversimplifies outbreak dynamics by using a single logistic function based solely on COTS population relative to a threshold. This approach does not capture the positive feedback mechanisms (such as aggregation behavior and reduced predation) that can abruptly drive outbreak escalation.

Chosen Improvement:
-------------------
We introduce a quadratic amplification factor to the outbreak trigger. When the COTS abundance exceeds the outbreak threshold (a fraction of the carrying capacity), the outbreak trigger is nonlinearly amplified. This improves the representation of the rapid onset and high magnitude of outbreak events observed ecologically.

Parameter Added:
----------------
- `outbreak_amplification`: A multiplier applied to the quadratic term, capturing the intensification of outbreak dynamics once critical densities are reached. This parameter reflects aggregated behavioral responses and other ecological feedbacks.

This enhancement is expected to better capture the boom-bust cycles in COTS populations and their selective interactions with coral communities.
