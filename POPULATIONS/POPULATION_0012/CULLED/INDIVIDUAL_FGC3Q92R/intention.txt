Assessment:
The current model captures the outbreak dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) effectively and simulates the boom-bust cycles as well as their predation on fast- and slow-growing coral. However, the model oversimplifies coral recovery by assuming an unrestricted regenerative process. In natural reef systems, coral recovery can be significantly limited by available resources (e.g., nutrients, light).

Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, "resource_limitation", to dampen coral recovery. This parameter (scaled 0-1) modulates the recovery term in both fast-growing and slow-growing coral dynamics, better reflecting the ecological reality of nutrient constraints. This added complexity is ecologically justified and should help improve the model fit to observed data.
