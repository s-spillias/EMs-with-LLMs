Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures COTS boom‐bust dynamics but appears to under‐react when coral cover declines. Residuals indicate that outbreak onset is not sufficiently sensitive under stressed coral conditions. Ecologically, lowered coral cover can remove natural checks on COTS, leading to an enhanced outbreak.
Improvement:
We introduce a feedback mechanism into the outbreak trigger. A new parameter, "coral_feedback_threshold", is added. When the total coral cover (fast + slow) falls below this threshold, the effective threshold for triggering an outbreak is reduced. This modification better captures the non‐linear dynamics of outbreak intensification under coral stress.
