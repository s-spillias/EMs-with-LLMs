Assessment: Analysis of residuals indicates systematic underprediction at outbreak onset and overprediction during decline. The current model’s outbreak trigger based on a logistic function using outbreak_sharpness does not fully capture the abrupt threshold behavior observed in COTS outbreaks.

Improvement: We introduce an improved outbreak trigger mechanism using a polynomial formulation controlled by a new parameter, trigger_exponent. This change computes a ratio of the previous COTS population to the outbreak threshold (scaled by carrying capacity) and then applies a power function to capture the sharp escalation once the threshold is crossed. This non-linear scaling better reflects density-dependent outbreak initiation and promotes realistic boom‐bust dynamics, all while ensuring predictions use only previous time step values.
