Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
Based on an evaluation of the model's performance and residual analysis, the model reasonably captures the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks as well as coral dynamics. However, the current implementation of coral predation uses a linear saturating function that oversimplifies the ecological dynamics. By modifying the predation terms to include a squared functional response, we better capture the non-linear response of coral vulnerability to predation. This adjustment produces a threshold-like effect where, at moderate coral cover, predation efficiency increases more sharply before saturating, thereby representing a more realistic predator-prey interaction in the ecosystem.
