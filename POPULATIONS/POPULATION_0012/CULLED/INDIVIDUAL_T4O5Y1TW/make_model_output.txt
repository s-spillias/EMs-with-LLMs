Below are the proposed changes. We will update the intention file with our assessment and then modify the predation functional forms for both coral equations in the model so that the response is more non‐linear     
(using a squared term) to better capture the dynamics of COTS predation. This change is ecologically justified because it allows the model to represent a threshold‐like behavior where predation efficiency increases 
steeply at moderate coral cover levels before saturating, which aligns with documented predator-prey interactions observed in reef dynamics.

 Based on an evaluation of the model's performance and residual analysis, the model reasonably captures the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks as well as coral dynamics. However, the current implementation of   
 coral predation uses a linear saturating function that oversimplifies the ecological dynamics. By modifying the predation terms to include a squared functional response, we better capture the non-linear response o 
 coral vulnerability to predation. This adjustment produces a threshold-like effect where, at moderate coral cover, predation efficiency increases more sharply before saturating, thereby representing a more realist 
 predator-prey interaction in the ecosystem.
