Assessment:
The current model captures boom‐bust COTS dynamics and coral predation relatively well; however, the use of a fixed Michaelis–Menten functional form for coral availability does not allow for flexible non‐linear effects. Ecologically, coral cover may influence COTS growth in a more threshold‐like or synergistic manner. To address this, we propose introducing a new parameter `coral_availability_exponent` to allow higher‑order, non‑linear scaling of the effective coral resource. This change captures potential threshold/synergistic effects of coral availability on COTS outbreak dynamics.
