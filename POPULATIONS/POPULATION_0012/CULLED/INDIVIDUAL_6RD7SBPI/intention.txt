Our assessment of the model:
1. The current model captures the boom‚Äêbust dynamics of COTS but shows residual patterns that suggest the outbreak triggering mechanism may be oversimplified.
2. The outbreak trigger presently depends solely on COTS density relative to a threshold, without accounting for the state of the coral community.
3. Ecologically, low coral cover should dampen outbreak initiation since it indicates a degraded reef with less available food.
4. To address this, we introduce a new parameter, coral_threshold_for_outbreak, and modify the outbreak_trigger calculation to include a coral-dependent logistic modifier.
