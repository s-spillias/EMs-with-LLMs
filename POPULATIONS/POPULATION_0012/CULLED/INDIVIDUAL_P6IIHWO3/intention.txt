MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

Strengths:
1. Age-structured mortality captures high juvenile mortality (80-90% annually) vs lower adult mortality (30-50%)
2. Local spawning feedback mechanism enables self-sustaining outbreaks once mature population established
3. Nutrient-mediated larval survival with sigmoidal threshold creates non-linear outbreak trigger
4. Dual temperature optima (adult recruitment at 28.5°C, bloom conditions at 26.5°C) reflects different ecological processes
5. Type II functional response with handling time for coral predation is mechanistically sound
6. Differential attack rates on fast vs slow corals captures selective predation

Weaknesses identified:
1. Maturation rate is constant, but COTS development is strongly temperature-dependent
2. This missing temperature-maturation link affects outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration
3. No interaction between the two temperature-dependent processes (recruitment and maturation)
4. Seasonal dynamics implicit in SST data but not explicitly leveraged for maturation timing

=== CRITICAL MISSING PROCESS ===

Temperature-dependent maturation rate

Ecological justification:
- COTS are ectotherms - metabolic rates scale with temperature following Q10 relationships
- Warmer waters accelerate larval development, juvenile growth, and sexual maturation
- Literature suggests maturation time varies from 1.5 years (warm conditions) to 3+ years (cooler conditions)
- This creates a positive feedback loop for outbreaks:
  * Warm year → faster maturation → more fecund adults sooner → stronger local recruitment → faster outbreak buildup

Impact on PROJECT CONTEXT objectives:
1. TIMING: Temperature-accelerated maturation explains why outbreaks develop faster in warmer years
2. MAGNITUDE: Faster maturation increases the rate at which population transitions to highly fecund adults (maturity² scaling)
3. DURATION: Temperature variability modulates age structure, affecting outbreak persistence
4. BOOM-BUST CYCLES: Adds realism to the transition from outbreak initiation to peak abundance

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT ===

Add temperature-dependent maturation using Q10 formulation:

maturation_rate_effective = maturity_rate_base * Q10_maturation^((SST - temp_ref_maturation)/10)

New parameters:
1. log_Q10_maturation: Log temperature coefficient for maturation rate (dimensionless)
   - Typical Q10 for ectotherm development: 2.0-3.0
   - Initial value: log(2.5) ≈ 0.916
   - Bounds: log(1.5) to log(4.0) → [0.405, 1.386]
   - Higher values = stronger temperature sensitivity

2. temp_ref_maturation: Reference temperature for maturation rate (°C)
   - Should be near mean SST for the region (~27°C)
   - Initial value: 27.0°C
   - Bounds: 25.0 to 29.0°C
   - This is the temperature at which maturity_rate_base applies

Mathematical implementation:
- Replace constant maturity_rate with temperature-modulated maturity_rate_effective
- Maintains existing maturity dynamics structure (aging toward 1, recruitment dilution toward 0)
- Q10 formulation is standard for temperature-dependent biological rates
- Ecologically interpretable: Q10=2 means rate doubles per 10°C increase

Expected outcomes:
1. Warmer years → faster maturation → earlier outbreak peaks
2. Cooler years → slower maturation → delayed or suppressed outbreaks
3. Temperature variability → variable age structure → more realistic boom-bust dynamics
4. Interaction with existing temperature-dependent recruitment creates compound environmental sensitivity

Parameter renaming for clarity:
- log_maturity_rate → log_maturity_rate_base (to clarify this is baseline at reference temperature)

This improvement adds ecological realism without excessive complexity, using a well-established biological relationship (Q10 temperature dependence) that directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on outbreak timing and dynamics.
