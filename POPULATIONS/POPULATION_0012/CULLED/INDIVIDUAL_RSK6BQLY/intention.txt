Assessment:
The current model captures the general boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks but oversimplifies the influence of environmental conditions on outbreak initiation. In its current form, the outbreak trigger depends solely on population density relative to a fixed threshold. However, ecological evidence suggests that high coral availability can amplify outbreak conditions while low coral levels may dampen them. 

To address this, we introduce a new parameter, env_variability_amplitude, that modulates the outbreak trigger as a function of coral availability. This non-linear feedback mechanism allows the model to better represent the complex interplay between coral abundance and COTS outbreak dynamics.
