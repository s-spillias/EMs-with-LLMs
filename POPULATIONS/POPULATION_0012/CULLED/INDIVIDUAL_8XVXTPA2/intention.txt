Assessment:
The current model adequately captures logistic growth and outbreak declines. However, residual analysis indicates that the model slightly overestimates growth at very low COTS densities. This suggests the absence of an Allee effect, whereby sparse populations experience reduced growth due to challenges such as mate finding.
Improvement:
To better represent the observed boom‚Äêbust cycles, an Allee effect has been incorporated into the growth formulation. The new parameter "allee_threshold" modulates growth at low population densities, ensuring that initial increases are subdued until a minimal viable density is reached.
Ecological Justification:
Including an Allee effect aligns with ecological observations where low population densities hinder reproduction and social interactions, potentially delaying outbreak initiation.
