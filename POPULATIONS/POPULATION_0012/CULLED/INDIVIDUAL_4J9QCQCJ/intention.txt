After evaluating the model, the residuals indicate that the outbreak decline phase may be underestimated. The current model uses a constant exponent (outbreak_decline_exponent) to describe the decline of the COTS population. However, ecological observations suggest that once COTS exceed a threshold relative to the carrying capacity, density‐dependent competition intensifies the crash phase.
  
To capture this, we introduce a new parameter, decline_density_mod, which augments the decline exponent when the population is above the outbreak threshold. This dynamic adjustment better reflects the rapid downturn (bust phase) in outbreaks, improving the ecological realism of the boom–bust cycle in COTS dynamics.
