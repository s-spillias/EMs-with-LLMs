Assessment:
The current model captures the boom‐bust cycles of COTS and the impact of predation on coral cover. However, residual analysis indicates a systematic underestimation of outbreak intensity during high environmental stress periods. Ecologically, factors such as elevated water temperatures can weaken coral resilience and simultaneously trigger more abrupt COTS outbreaks. 

Improvement:
To better capture these dynamics, we add an environmental modifier parameter ("env_modifier") that scales the outbreak trigger steepness, thereby making outbreak onset sensitive to environmental stress. This approach enhances the model's realism by integrating an indirect pathway wherein environmental conditions modulate outbreak dynamics.

Reasoning:
• Incorporating “env_modifier” allows the outbreak dynamics to be more responsive when environmental stress is high.
• It avoids data leakage by only using previous time step values in calculations.
• The added complexity is justified by observed residual patterns suggesting missing environmental influences.
