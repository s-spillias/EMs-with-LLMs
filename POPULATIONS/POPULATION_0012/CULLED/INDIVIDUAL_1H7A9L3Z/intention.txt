Assessment and Improvement:
Residual analysis indicates that the current model sometimes overpredicts the outbreak magnitude and timing. This may be due to an oversimplified, linear density‚Äêdependent term in the logistic growth formulation of COTS dynamics.
Our improvement is to introduce a new parameter, density_dependence_exponent, that raises the density-dependent term to a power. This provides a flexible, non-linear regulation mechanism that intensifies competition at high COTS densities, addressing ecological overcrowding effects.
All calculations still only use previous time step predictions to avoid data leakage.
