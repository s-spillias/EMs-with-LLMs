Assessment:
The current model reasonably captures the boom–bust cycles of COTS outbreaks by combining logistic growth with a smooth outbreak-triggered decline and saturating predation on coral.
However, analyses of the residuals indicate that predation efficiency appears to drop more sharply at very high COTS densities than the model currently accounts for. Ecologically, this can be due to interference competition among starfish—when overly crowded, starfish interfere with each other reducing per capita predation rates.
Improvement:
We introduce a new exponential interference term into the predation equations for both fast‐ and slow-growing coral. Specifically, the predation term is multiplied by exp(–starfish_interference * COTS[t–1] / (carrying_capacity + eps)), where the new parameter starfish_interference quantifies the level of interference.
This modification, using only previous state values, better captures the observed dynamics by reducing predation during outbreak peaks.
