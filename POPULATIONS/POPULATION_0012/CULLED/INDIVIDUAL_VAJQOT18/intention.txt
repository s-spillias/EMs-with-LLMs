MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a COTS-coral predator-prey system with Allee effects, temperature dependencies, and functional responses. The model captures basic outbreak dynamics but could be improved with additional environmental drivers when data becomes available.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. The model has outbreak potential through Allee effects
2. Temperature-dependent larval survival provides environmental filtering
3. Updated parameter temp_opt_cots (28.5째C, bounds 28.0-29.0째C) suggests very specific thermal requirements
4. The tightened temperature tolerance width reflects this specificity

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:
Tightened temperature response for COTS larval survival to reflect updated optimal temperature specificity.

RATIONALE:
The updated temp_opt_cots parameter (28.5째C with tight bounds 28.0-29.0째C) from literature indicates COTS larvae have very specific thermal requirements. The temperature tolerance width (log_temp_width_cots) has been adjusted to create a more restrictive Gaussian response curve that better reflects this narrow optimal range.

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Maintained Gaussian temperature response: exp(-((T - T_opt)^2) / (2 * width^2))
2. Adjusted bounds on log_temp_width_cots to allow tighter tolerance curves
3. This creates stronger environmental filtering of recruitment events

EQUATIONS MODIFIED:
- Equation 1: Temperature effect on COTS larval survival uses tightened tolerance width

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- More realistic temperature filtering of larval survival
- Recruitment events more tightly coupled to optimal temperature windows
- Better representation of thermal constraints on COTS population dynamics
- Improved seasonal and interannual variation in recruitment success

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
When nutrient/productivity data becomes available (e.g., chlorophyll-a, river discharge), the model could be enhanced with:
- Nutrient-mediated larval survival mechanism
- Michaelis-Menten response to food availability
- This would add episodic outbreak triggers linked to flood events and phytoplankton blooms
- Parameters would include: nutrient_dat (DATA_VECTOR), log_nutrient_half_sat, and nutrient_effect_max

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
The tightened temperature response is based on:
- COTS larvae have narrow thermal optima for development and survival
- Small deviations from optimal temperature significantly reduce larval success
- This creates strong seasonal patterns in recruitment potential
- Temperature acts as a primary environmental filter for outbreak initiation
