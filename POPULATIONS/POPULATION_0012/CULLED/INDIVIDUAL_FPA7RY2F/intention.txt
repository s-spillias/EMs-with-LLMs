Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The residual analysis indicates that the current outbreak trigger function, while incorporating quadratic non‐linearity, underestimates the abrupt onset seen in observed COTS outbreaks. To better capture the sudden explosion in population, we introduce a cubic term in the outbreak trigger function. Ecologically, this higher‐order non‐linear response (via the new parameter "outbreak_cubic_amplifier") provides additional flexibility at high COTS densities, ensuring that the onset of outbreaks is more abrupt and hence better reflecting the boom-bust cycle observed on the Great Barrier Reef.
