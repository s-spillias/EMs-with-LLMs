Plan and Assessment:                                                                                                                   

 1 We assessed that while the model already embeds non-linearity (using quadratic terms and a logistic outbreak trigger), the outbreak 
   onset is still not flexible enough to capture the abrupt transitions seen in the residuals.                                         
 2 To improve the capture of outbreak dynamics, we add a cubic term in the outbreak trigger function (with new parameter               
   outbreak_cubic_amplifier). Ecologically, this additional term allows for a higher‐order non‐linear response such that when COTS     
   density is high the outbreak ramps up more abruptly.                                                                                
 3 We update the parameter list in the model and parameters.json to include this new parameter with its justification.                 
 4 In the model’s outbreak trigger function, we include the new cubic term before subtracting the threshold term.                      
 5 Finally, we update the intention.txt file with our assessment and reasoning.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                 
 The residual analysis indicates that the current outbreak trigger function, while incorporating quadratic non‐linearity, underestimat 
 the abrupt onset seen in observed COTS outbreaks. To better capture the sudden explosion in population, we introduce a cubic term in  
 the outbreak trigger function. Ecologically, this higher‐order non‐linear response (via the new parameter "outbreak_cubic_amplifier") 
 provides additional flexibility at high COTS densities, ensuring that the onset of outbreaks is more abrupt and hence better reflecti 
 the boom-bust cycle observed on the Great Barrier Reef.
