Assessment and Reasoning:
After evaluating the model and its residuals, it was observed that the outbreak trigger mechanism could be improved by capturing higher‐order threshold effects. The current logistic outbreak trigger may oversimplify the abrupt transition from normal to outbreak states. To address this, a new parameter ("trigger_curvature") is introduced to allow a squared term to modify the outbreak trigger. Ecologically, this represents a sharper, more nonlinear switch in population dynamics that better reflects the boom–bust cycles in COTS and their response thresholds to population density. This enhancement, while modest, provides greater flexibility in tuning model behavior to the observed rapid outbreak initiation.
