Below are the changes proposed.                                                                                                        

Summary of changes and rationale:                                                                                                      

 1 Intention Update: We explain that after evaluating the model and its residuals, we noticed that the outbreak trigger—currently      
   represented by a logistic function—may benefit from a higher‐order nonlinearity. By introducing a new parameter (trigger_curvature),
   we allow the outbreak trigger to be modified by adding a squared term to the core threshold expression. This change helps capture   
   the sharp transition between non‐outbreak and outbreak regimes and better reflects observed boom–bust cycles.                       
 2 New Parameter: We add a new parameter, trigger_curvature, to parameters.json with a value of 0.1. Its ecological justification is   
   that it modulates the curvature of the outbreak trigger response, capturing any higher‐order threshold effects in COTS density that 
   might be important for accurately modeling the rapid outbreak onset.                                                                
 3 Model Update: In model.cpp we add the trigger_curvature parameter to the parameter list and modify the outbreak trigger calculation.
   Instead of simply using the difference between the powered COTS density and the outbreak threshold, we now add a term proportional  
   to the square of that difference. We then use this modified trigger to compute the outbreak response. This ensures that only the    
   previous timestep’s predictions are used, maintaining causality.

 Assessment and Reasoning:                                                                                                             
 After evaluating the model and its residuals, it was observed that the outbreak trigger mechanism could be improved by capturing      
 higher‐order threshold effects. The current logistic outbreak trigger may oversimplify the abrupt transition from normal to outbreak  
 states. To address this, a new parameter ("trigger_curvature") is introduced to allow a squared term to modify the outbreak trigger.  
 Ecologically, this represents a sharper, more nonlinear switch in population dynamics that better reflects the boom–bust cycles in CO 
 and their response thresholds to population density. This enhancement, while modest, provides greater flexibility in tuning model     
 behavior to the observed rapid outbreak initiation.
