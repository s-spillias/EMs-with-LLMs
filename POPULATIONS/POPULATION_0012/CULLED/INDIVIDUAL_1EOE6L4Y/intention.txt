Assessment:
The current model adequately captures the boom‐bust cycles of COTS outbreaks and their impacts on fast‐ and slow-growing corals. However, the resource limitation mechanism is oversimplified by using a basic Michaelis–Menten function, which may not capture non‐linear threshold effects observed in coral resource uptake.
Improvement:
We introduce a Hill function for resource limitation with the new parameter "hill_exponent". This change allows for a more flexible representation of how diminishing coral availability influences COTS growth, better reflecting ecological non-linearities. All predictions continue to use only lagged (previous time step) response variable values to avoid data leakage.
