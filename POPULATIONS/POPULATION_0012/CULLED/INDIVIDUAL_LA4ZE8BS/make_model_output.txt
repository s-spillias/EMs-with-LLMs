Below are the proposed changes:                                                                                                        

Overview:                                                                                                                              

 • We assessed that the current model’s outbreak trigger is too simple. The residuals indicate that the model underestimates the rapid 
   outbreak onset and overshoots in the decline phase. The current logistic outbreak trigger uses a single non‐linear term based only  
   on previous COTS levels and coral availability.                                                                                     
 • To capture sharper and more abrupt outbreak initiations we introduce an additional quadratic feedback term. Ecologically, this extra
   parameter (named outbreak_quadratic_feedback) accounts for higher‐order effects when both COTS density and coral availability are   
   high, thus amplifying outbreak initiation in a non‐linear manner.                                                                   
 • In our modifications we update the intention file with our assessment. We add the new parameter to parameters.json along with       
   ecological justification, update the TMB model in model.cpp to declare the new parameter, and modify the outbreak trigger equation  
   accordingly.                                                                                                                        
 • Note: We also ensure that the model uses only previous time step values (from _pred) in its calculations.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 After evaluating residuals and the model’s performance, the current model appears to under‐capture the sharp outbreak initiation and  
 exhibits overly gradual declines post‐outbreak. Although the logistic growth with resource limitation is well‐represented, the outbre 
 trigger mechanism is oversimplified, relying solely on a power function of past COTS density modulated by coral availability.         
                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                
 We introduce a quadratic feedback term in the outbreak trigger. The new parameter "outbreak_quadratic_feedback" will amplify the      
 outbreak trigger when both COTS density and coral availability are high. This modification provides the necessary non‐linear          
 amplification to better capture the abrupt onset of outbreak events observed in the data.

Below are the proposed changes:

**Overview:**  
- We assessed that the current model’s outbreak trigger is too simple. The residuals indicate that the model underestimates the rapid 
outbreak onset and overshoots in the decline phase. The current logistic outbreak trigger uses a single non‐linear term based only on 
previous COTS levels and coral availability.  
- To capture sharper and more abrupt outbreak initiations we introduce an additional quadratic feedback term. Ecologically, this extra 
parameter (named `outbreak_quadratic_feedback`) accounts for higher‐order effects when both COTS density and coral availability are 
high, thus amplifying outbreak initiation in a non‐linear manner.  
- In our modifications we update the intention file with our assessment. We add the new parameter to `parameters.json` along with 
ecological justification, update the TMB model in `model.cpp` to declare the new parameter, and modify the outbreak trigger equation 
accordingly.  
- Note: We also ensure that the model uses only previous time step values (from `_pred`) in its calculations.

 After evaluating the residuals and overall model performance, we determined that the current outbreak trigger is too simplistic—it    
 underestimates the rapid outbreak onset and overshoots during the decline phase. While the logistic growth and resource limitation    
 mechanisms appear adequate, the non‐linear outbreak trigger based solely on the previous COTS density and coral availability does not 
 fully capture abrupt outbreak dynamics.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                                
 We introduce an additional quadratic feedback term (new parameter: outbreak_quadratic_feedback) into the outbreak trigger calculation 
 Ecologically, this parameter accounts for higher‐order effects when both COTS density and coral availability are high, thereby        
 amplifying outbreak initiation in a non‐linear manner. We also ensure that only values from the previous time step (_pred variables)  
 are used in the calculations to avoid data leakage.
