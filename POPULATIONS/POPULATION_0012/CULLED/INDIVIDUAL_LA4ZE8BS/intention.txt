Assessment:
After evaluating the residuals and overall model performance, we determined that the current outbreak trigger is too simplistic—it underestimates the rapid outbreak onset and overshoots during the decline phase. While the logistic growth and resource limitation mechanisms appear adequate, the non‐linear outbreak trigger based solely on the previous COTS density and coral availability does not fully capture abrupt outbreak dynamics.

Improvement Rationale:
We introduce an additional quadratic feedback term (new parameter: outbreak_quadratic_feedback) into the outbreak trigger calculation. Ecologically, this parameter accounts for higher‐order effects when both COTS density and coral availability are high, thereby amplifying outbreak initiation in a non‐linear manner. We also ensure that only values from the previous time step (_pred variables) are used in the calculations to avoid data leakage.
