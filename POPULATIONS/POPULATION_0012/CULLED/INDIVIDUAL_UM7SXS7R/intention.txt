Assessment for model improvement:

After analyzing the current model fit against the residuals, it appears that the model may underestimate the reduction in predation efficiency at high COTS densities. The existing formulation scales the handling time with the coral cover, which could lead to an overestimation of predation loss when COTS are abundant.

To address this, we introduce a density-dependent interference mechanism in the predation process. We modify the predation terms in the coral dynamics so that the handling time scales with the previous COTS density. This change reflects ecological interference at high COTS populations, where individual feeding efficiency declines due to competition among predators. This improvement aligns with ecological theory on predator interference and is expected to enhance the model's ability to capture the outbreak boom-bust dynamics more realistically.
