Below is our plan:                                                                                                                     

 1 Assess the model: The current model applies a linear resource‐limitation mechanism to adjust COTS growth with coral availability.   
   Analysis of the residuals suggests that the relationship is more non‐linear. Ecologically, when coral cover is very low, limitations
   may accelerate the decline of available resources (or impact outbreak dynamics) more than a linear term captures.                   
 2 Chosen Improvement: We add a quadratic term to the resource limitation function. This higher-order modification (with a new         
   parameter called resource_limitation_quadratic) will allow the model to capture non-linear saturation effects in the resource uptake
   process, providing a more refined representation of outbreak magnitude and duration. We also add this parameter to the              
   parameters.json file with ecological justification.                                                                                 
 3 Implementation:                                                                                                                     
    • In intention.txt, we document our assessment and reasoning.                                                                      
    • In model.cpp, we insert the new parameter declaration after resource_limitation_strength and update the growth equation in       
      Equation 1.                                                                                                                      
    • In parameters.json, we add a new entry for resource_limitation_quadratic with an initial guess and explanation.

 =======                                                                                                                               
 Assessment of Current Model:                                                                                                          
 The current model fits using a linear resource limitation term to modulate COTS growth based on coral availability. However, the      
 residuals indicate that this linear assumption may oversimplify the complex, non-linear dependency between coral resources and the    
 outbreak dynamics of COTS.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                       
 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                   
 A quadratic term is introduced into the resource limitation mechanism. By modifying the growth term with a second-order factor, the   
 model can better capture the accelerating effects of low coral availability and the associated non-linear saturation in resource      
 uptake. This improvement aligns with ecological expectations of competition and resource depletion during outbreaks.
