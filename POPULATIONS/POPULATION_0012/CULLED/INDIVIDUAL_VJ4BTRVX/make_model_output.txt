Below are four SEARCH/REPLACE blocks that implement one key ecological improvement. In our assessment we noted that the current model oversimplifies outbreak initiation by relying solely on a logistic trigger. In reality, very high COTS densities may exert non‐linear feedbacks on outbreak initiation due to additional stressors or saturation effects. Therefore, we add a    
quadratic term to the outbreak trigger function. This adds a new parameter (outbreak_quad) that allows the outbreak trigger to change more rapidly at very high COTS densities, thereby better capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of the outbreak events.

 - The current model captures the general outbreak boom‐bust cycles but uses a logistic outbreak trigger that may not fully capture the non‐linear dynamics at very high COTS densities.                                                                                                                                                                                               
 - Ecologically, when COTS densities are high, stressors or saturation effects can lead to accelerated feedbacks that are not represented by a simple linear threshold.

 - Introduce a quadratic term into the outbreak trigger function via a new parameter, “outbreak_quad”, to capture additional density‐dependent non‐linear effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 - This adjustment allows the model to better replicate the observed rapid onset and collapse of outbreaks.

After applying these changes, consider rebuilding the model and checking forecast residuals to validate if the new non-linear outbreak trigger better captures the observed episodic dynamics.
