Assessment:
- The current model captures the general outbreak boom‐bust cycles but uses a logistic outbreak trigger that may not fully capture the non‐linear dynamics at very high COTS densities.
- Ecologically, when COTS densities are high, stressors or saturation effects can lead to accelerated feedbacks that are not represented by a simple linear threshold.
Improvement:
- Introduce a quadratic term into the outbreak trigger function via a new parameter, “outbreak_quad”, to capture additional density‐dependent non‐linear effects.
- This adjustment allows the model to better replicate the observed rapid onset and collapse of outbreaks.
