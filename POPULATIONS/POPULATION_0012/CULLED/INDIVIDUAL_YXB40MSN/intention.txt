This version of the model has been assessed based on its ability to capture the boom–bust cycle of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and their predatory effects on coral communities. 
The current formulation uses logistic growth for COTS and linear gap-based recovery for both fast-growing (Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Porites spp.) corals. 
Residual analysis indicates that the model sometimes underestimates the delay in coral recovery when cover is very low, which may be due to the absence of a mechanism capturing an Allee effect in coral recruitment. 

To improve the ecological realism, we have introduced an Allee effect in the recovery equations. Specifically, the recovery term is now multiplied by (coral_cover/100), meaning that when coral cover is low, the recovery rate is suppressed. 
This change better represents ecological situations where low coral density can impair recruitment and recovery, resulting in delayed recovery after a severe outbreak.

No variables use current time step values of response observations—all predictions rely solely on the previous time step, preventing data leakage.
