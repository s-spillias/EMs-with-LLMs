Assessment and Ecological Improvement Rationale:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Model Fit & Data: The residuals indicate discrepancies in outbreak onset timing and magnitude. The current logistic outbreak trigger is not flexible enough to capture the rapid transition observed in the data.
2. Model Context: The model aims to capture episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish, with boom-bust cycles and selective predation on coral communities.
3. Key Process Improvement: The existing outbreak trigger uses a linear difference between the previous COTS population and half the carrying capacity, which may oversimplify the abrupt threshold dynamics.
4. Proposed Improvement: Introduce a new parameter "outbreak_threshold_exponent" to exponentiate the normalized COTS population (i.e. cots_pred[t-1] / (carrying_capacity + eps)). This yields a non-linear, threshold-like response that better reflects how outbreaks rapidly ensue once a critical density is exceeded.
Ecological Justification: Many ecological systems exhibit sharp transitions near critical thresholds. This modification enhances model realism by more accurately capturing outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
