Below are the proposed changes. I've chosen to add an Allee effect to the coral recovery terms because ecological literature suggests  
that coral recovery is often hindered at extremely low coral cover. In our current model, recovery is a linear function of the gap up  
to 100%. By multiplying the recovery term by a density‐dependent factor (current cover divided by the sum of current cover and a new   
threshold parameter), the model should better capture the delayed or reduced recovery observed when coral cover is very low. This      
improvement aligns with the dynamics of boom‐bust cycles and improves the model’s ecological realism without using the current time    
step data in predictions.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                       
 1. The current model successfully captures the basic outbreak dynamics of COTS and their impact on coral communities. However, the    
 coral recovery dynamics are modeled as a simple linear function based solely on the gap to maximum cover (100%), which may oversimpli 
 true ecological recovery processes.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                       
 2. Ecological studies indicate that recovery can exhibit an Allee effect, whereby very low coral cover hinders recovery due to reduce 
 reproductive capacity and recruitment. Incorporating a density-dependent (non-linear) recovery term better reflects this phenomenon.  
                                                                                                                                       
 3. This modification introduces a new parameter, "coral_recovery_allee", and multiplies the recovery term by a factor of (current cor 
 cover / (current coral cover + coral_recovery_allee)). This change enhances the model’s ability to predict realistic coral recovery   
 trajectories post-outbreak, improves the fit to observed data residuals, and better represents key indirect feedback mechanisms in th 
 ecosystem.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                       
 Overall, this improvement provides a more ecologically realistic framework for modeling coral recovery under stress from episodic COT 
 outbreaks.

Below is the proposed change for model.cpp. We need to declare the new parameter coral_recovery_allee in the parameters section. This  
will allow its use in the coral recovery equations.
