Below are the changes that implement a non‐linear inhibition on coral recovery. The idea is to replace the linear inhibition in the    
recovery terms for both fast-growing and slow-growing corals with a non‐linear term. To allow flexibility in the curvature of this     
inhibition, we add a new parameter, coral_recovery_nonlinearity, to the parameters file. The new inhibition term now reads as          
  1 – coral_recovery_inhibition · (cots_pred[t-1] / (carrying_capacity + eps))^coral_recovery_nonlinearity                             
which better reflects that high COTS densities can disproportionately worsen coral recovery. This function only uses previous time step
predictions, avoiding any data leakage. Finally, we update intention.txt to document our assessment and ecological reasoning.

 Assessment and Improvement:                                                                                                           
 --------------------------------                                                                                                      
 After evaluating the model, the structure appears robust in capturing COTS outbreak dynamics and coral interactions. However, the cor 
 recovery process is oversimplified by using a linear inhibition factor. Ecologically, high densities of COTS likely result in a       
 disproportionately severe impairment of coral recovery.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, we introduce a non-linear inhibition on coral recovery by adding a new parameter "coral_recovery_nonlinearity". The  
 recovery term is modified as:                                                                                                         
     1 - coral_recovery_inhibition * pow(cots_pred[t-1] / (carrying_capacity + eps), coral_recovery_nonlinearity)                      
 This adjustment better captures the delayed recovery of corals under heavy predation, resulting in more realistic boom-bust cycles.
