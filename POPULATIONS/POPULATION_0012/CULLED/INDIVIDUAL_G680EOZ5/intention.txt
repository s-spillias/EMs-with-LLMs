Assessment and Improvement:
--------------------------------
After evaluating the model, the structure appears robust in capturing COTS outbreak dynamics and coral interactions. However, the coral recovery process is oversimplified by using a linear inhibition factor. Ecologically, high densities of COTS likely result in a disproportionately severe impairment of coral recovery. 

To address this, we introduce a non-linear inhibition on coral recovery by adding a new parameter "coral_recovery_nonlinearity". The recovery term is modified as:
    1 - coral_recovery_inhibition * pow(cots_pred[t-1] / (carrying_capacity + eps), coral_recovery_nonlinearity)
This adjustment better captures the delayed recovery of corals under heavy predation, resulting in more realistic boom-bust cycles.
