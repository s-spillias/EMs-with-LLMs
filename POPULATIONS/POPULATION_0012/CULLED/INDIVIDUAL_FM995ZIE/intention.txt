Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model fits many aspects of the COTS outbreak dynamics but appears to underestimate the rapid onset and sustained magnitude of outbreaks. The outbreak trigger function currently uses a linear difference between the COTS population and a threshold scaled by carrying capacity. This may oversimplify the ecological reality where outbreaks are often triggered by non‐linear, threshold‐like responses.
Improvement:
Introduce a new parameter, "outbreak_trigger_exponent", to allow a non-linear (higher‐order) response of the outbreak trigger to the normalized COTS density (cots_pred[t-1] / carrying_capacity). This adjustment provides additional flexibility to model abrupt outbreak initiation as populations approach critical levels, thereby better capturing the boom-bust dynamics observed in the Great Barrier Reef.
