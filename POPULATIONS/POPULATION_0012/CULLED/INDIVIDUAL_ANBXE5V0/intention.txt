Assessment and Reasoning:
After evaluating the model and its residuals, we found that the coral recovery responses may be oversimplified.
In particular, sustained high densities of COTS can lead to long‐term damage to coral, delaying recovery even after the outbreak subsides.
To capture this, we introduce a new parameter "lagged_cots_effect" that reduces the coral recovery rate based on the square of the ratio of the previous period’s COTS density to the carrying capacity.
This adjustment adds an ecologically justified delayed feedback mechanism into the model.
