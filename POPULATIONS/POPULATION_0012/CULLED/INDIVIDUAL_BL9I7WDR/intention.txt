Assessment:
After reviewing the model’s residuals, the current formulation for coral predation appears overly linear. While the outbreak and boom‐bust dynamics are captured reasonably well, the predation on coral communities does not reflect potential non‐linear scaling. In real ecosystems, predation efficiency may accelerate or saturate depending on coral density.

Improvement:
Introduce a new parameter, "predation_efficiency_exponent", to allow for a flexible, power-law scaling of the predation efficiency. This change enables the model to capture diminishing or amplifying predation impacts on coral cover as density changes. The implementation uses a power‐law functional response in both fast- and slow-growing coral equations, ensuring that only previous time step values are used to avoid data leakage.
