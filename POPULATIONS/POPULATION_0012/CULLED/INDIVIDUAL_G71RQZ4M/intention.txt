Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model captures the boom-bust dynamics using logistic growth and an outbreak-triggered decline. However, residual analysis revealed that the timing of the outbreak collapse is not well aligned with observations. Ecologically, when coral cover is high, COTS may benefit from a temporary food subsidy that delays decline, whereas low coral cover could exacerbate mortality. To improve the model's fit and ecological realism, a new parameter (coral_influence) has been introduced. This parameter adjusts the outbreak trigger threshold by incorporating the total coral cover from the previous timestep, ensuring that only lagged response variables are used. This modification better captures the indirect feedback mechanisms inherent in the system.
