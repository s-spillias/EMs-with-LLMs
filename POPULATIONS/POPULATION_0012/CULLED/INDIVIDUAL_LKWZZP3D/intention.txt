Assessment:
The current model successfully captures the boom‚Äêbust cycles of Crown of Thorns starfish (COTS) using logistic growth modulated by an outbreak trigger and includes predation effects on coral. However, an important ecological process is missing: the indirect feedback where the state of the coral community influences the intrinsic growth rate of COTS. Higher coral cover can enhance larval recruitment and survival (via increased food availability and improved habitat conditions), whereas degraded coral reefs may suppress outbreak progression. To capture this dynamic, a new parameter, "coral_influence", has been added. This parameter modulates the effective growth rate based on the average (previous time step) coral cover. This extension is ecologically justified and should help refine predictions of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration.
