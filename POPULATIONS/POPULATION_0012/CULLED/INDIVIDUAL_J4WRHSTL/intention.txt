Project Assessment:
The current model simulates boom‐bust outbreak cycles using a logistic growth framework combined with a smooth outbreak-triggered decline. Residual analysis indicates that at high COTS abundances, the model underestimates mortality likely driven by intensified intraspecific competition and resource limitation.
  
Improvement:
A density‐dependent competition term is added to capture the extra mortality when COTS density is high. This term, parameterized by "competition_factor", introduces a quadratic mortality effect relative to the carrying capacity, reflecting resource exhaustion and increased intraspecific competition.
