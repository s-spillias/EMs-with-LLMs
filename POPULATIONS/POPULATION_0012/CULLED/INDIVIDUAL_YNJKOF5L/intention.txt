Assessment and Reasoning:
The current model captures the basic boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks and incorporates important aspects like resource limitation and environmental modulation. However, the linear treatment of coral predation may oversimplify the dynamics, as predatorâ€“prey interactions often exhibit non-linear behaviors due to factors such as interference and variable prey detection.
To better represent these dynamics, we introduce a new parameter (predation_nonlin) to serve as a non-linear exponent in the predation terms. When predation_nonlin > 1, the predation losses are amplified at higher coral cover, capturing potential ecological feedbacks. This additional complexity is ecologically justified and expected to improve model fit.
