Below are the proposed changes with their ecological justification:                                                                                                                                                    

Assessment and Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                            

 1 Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                         
   The current model fits the outbreak dynamics moderately well but tends to oversimplify the recovery dynamics for corals by using a linear gap-filling formulation. This simplification does not capture the         
   density‐dependent (resource-limited) nature of coral recovery, which results in an overly rapid recovery in situations of very low coral cover and insufficient recovery acceleration when cover is intermediate.   
 2 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                 
   We implement a density-dependent (logistic‐type) recovery formulation for both fast and slow coral dynamics. Rather than using a simple constant recovery term (proportional solely to the gap from 100), we now    
   scale recovery by the current coral cover. This reflects resource limitation and competition effects—recovery will now be slower when coral cover is extremely low (reflecting limited recruitment) but will        
   saturate as cover increases. This approach is ecologically sound and better represents feedbacks in coral ecosystems.

   The intention.txt file is updated with the assessment and rationale, and the recovery equations in model.cpp for both fast and slow coral dynamics are modified accordingly. No additional parameters are added, as 
   the current parameters remain sufficient; we only change the functional form.

 The current model fits observed COTS and coral data moderately well but oversimplifies the recovery dynamics of coral communities. The recovery terms (for both fast-growing and slow-growing corals) use a linear    
 gap-based formulation (i.e., constant recovery rate multiplied by the difference from 100% cover). This approach neglects density-dependent effects and resource limitations inherent in coral recovery.              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 To address this, the recovery terms have been refactored to a logistic‐type formulation where the recovery rate scales with the current coral cover. This means that recovery is now proportional to the existing cor 
 cover as well as the gap to full cover, capturing the idea that very low coral cover may limit recruitment while higher cover can support faster recovery up to a saturation point. This change better reflects       
 ecological processes of density dependence and resource limitation.
