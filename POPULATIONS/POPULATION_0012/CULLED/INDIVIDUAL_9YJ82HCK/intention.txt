Current Model Assessment & Improvement Rationale:

The current model fits observed COTS and coral data moderately well but oversimplifies the recovery dynamics of coral communities. The recovery terms (for both fast-growing and slow-growing corals) use a linear gap-based formulation (i.e., constant recovery rate multiplied by the difference from 100% cover). This approach neglects density-dependent effects and resource limitations inherent in coral recovery. 

To address this, the recovery terms have been refactored to a logistic‚Äêtype formulation where the recovery rate scales with the current coral cover. This means that recovery is now proportional to the existing coral cover as well as the gap to full cover, capturing the idea that very low coral cover may limit recruitment while higher cover can support faster recovery up to a saturation point. This change better reflects ecological processes of density dependence and resource limitation.
