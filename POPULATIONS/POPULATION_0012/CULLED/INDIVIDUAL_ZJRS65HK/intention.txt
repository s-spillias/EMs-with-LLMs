Assessment and Improvement:
Based on the residuals analysis, the current model underpredicts the rapid outbreak growth. Although the model simulates boom‚Äêbust cycles, it oversimplifies the resource limitation mechanism by treating coral availability linearly. Ecologically, the influence of coral availability on COTS population growth can be highly non-linear (threshold effects) where limited resources sharply constrain growth until a critical level is reached. 

Improvement:
We add a new parameter "resource_limitation_exponent" that allows the coral availability term to be raised to a power, capturing these non-linear, density-dependent effects. This modification is expected to improve the fit by accounting for abrupt changes in the support that coral cover provides to COTS populations.
