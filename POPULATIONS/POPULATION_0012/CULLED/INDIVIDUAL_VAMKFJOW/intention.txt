Assessment of current model:
- The existing model captures boom-bust dynamics through logistic growth and a sigmoid outbreak trigger.
- Residual analysis indicates that the transition at outbreak initiation appears sharper than the current linear threshold.
Chosen improvement:
- Enhance the outbreak trigger mechanism by applying a cubic transformation to a normalized difference (COTS population relative to carrying capacity minus threshold 0.5).
- Ecological justification: This cubic term creates a more abrupt non-linear response around the threshold, reflecting the complex feedbacks and tipping points observed in episodic COTS outbreaks.
