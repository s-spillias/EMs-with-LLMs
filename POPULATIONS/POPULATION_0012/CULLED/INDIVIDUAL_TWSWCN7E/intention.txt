Assessment:
The current model captures logistic growth dynamics of COTS and employs a non-linear outbreak trigger influenced by environmental conditions. However, the model is missing an indirect feedback mechanism that links coral availability to outbreak decline. In natural ecosystems, when coral cover is severely depleted, COTS outbreaks tend to collapse more rapidly. To reflect this ecological process, we introduce a new parameter "coral_feedback_on_decline" that adjusts the outbreak decline rate based on normalized coral cover (sum of fast and slow coral, divided by 200). This change should improve the modelâ€™s ability to capture the characteristic boom-bust cycles.
