Assessment:
The current model captures the essential boom-bust dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) via logistic growth and a threshold-based outbreak trigger. However, residual analysis shows that under extreme environmental conditions, outbreak initiation can occur earlier than the model predicts. To address this, we introduce a new parameter, "env_threshold_modifier", which scales the outbreak threshold dynamically based on environmental stress. Values less than 1 lower the outbreak threshold, reflecting increased vulnerability of the ecosystem. This adjustment improves the model's ability to reflect the ecological feedback mechanisms involved in outbreak triggers without violating the principle of using only past state values in predictions.
