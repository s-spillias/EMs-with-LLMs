Assessment and Reasoning:
Based on the residuals and discrepancies between observed and predicted outbreak timings, the current model does not fully capture resource limitations in the ecosystem. In particular, the logistic growth of COTS is not moderated by the availability of coral, which is a key resource and also the target of predation. 

Improvement:
We introduce a resource limitation mechanism by scaling the logistic growth term with a factor representing the available coral cover. Specifically, we modify the growth term to multiply by ((fast_pred[t-1] + slow_pred[t-1]) / max_coral_cover), where max_coral_cover (set to 200 by default) represents full reef coral cover. This mechanism captures the ecological feedback that reduced coral cover limits COTS growth, thereby better representing the boom-bust dynamics observed.
