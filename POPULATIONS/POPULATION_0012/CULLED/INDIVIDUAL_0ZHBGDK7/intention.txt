Assessment:
- The current model captures key outbreak dynamics (boom-bust cycles) and selective coral predation.
- However, it is missing an explicit environmental modulation of the carrying capacity.
- Ecologically, favorable environmental conditions (e.g., temperature anomalies, nutrient boosts) can temporarily increase resource availability.
- Chosen Improvement: Introduce an "env_capacity_modifier" parameter that scales the carrying capacity, allowing the model to better trigger and sustain outbreak events.
