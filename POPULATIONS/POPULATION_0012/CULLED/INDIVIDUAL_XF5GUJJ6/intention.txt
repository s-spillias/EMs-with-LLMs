Assessment and Reasoning:
------------------------------------------
After evaluating the current model and residuals, it appears that while the logistic growth and outbreak trigger capture the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS, an important ecological process may be oversimplified: additional mortality arising from increased density (e.g., due to disease, competition, or cannibalism) at high COTS numbers. To better represent these density‐dependent effects, we introduce a new term, "density_dependent_mortality", which subtracts an extra mortality proportional to the square of the COTS density. This mechanism helps moderate extreme outbreak values and sustains realistic outbreak dynamics, aligning well with the project context.
