Below is our proposed set of changes. We are proposing three sets of updates:                                                                                                                                          

 1 intention.txt: We add our assessment and reasoning outlining our evaluation of the current model and our chosen improvement. In this case, we add a density‐dependent mortality term for COTS to capture added      
   losses at high density (e.g. due to disease, competition, and cannibalism), which is ecologically justifiable given the project context.                                                                            
 2 parameters.json: We add a new parameter, density_dependent_mortality, with an initial value (0.001) and clear justification.                                                                                        
 3 model.cpp: We update the COTS dynamics. First, we add the new parameter declaration after coral_half_saturation. Then, inside the time‐loop we calculate a new density‐dependent mortality term (density_decay) as  
   density_dependent_mortality * cots_pred[t-1]^2 and subtract it from the updated COTS population. We also ensure no current time step _dat values are used.

 After evaluating the current model and residuals, it appears that while the logistic growth and outbreak trigger capture the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS, an important ecological process may be oversimplified:       
 additional mortality arising from increased density (e.g., via disease, competition, or cannibalism) at high COTS numbers. To better represent these density‐dependent effects, we introduce a new term,              
 "density_dependent_mortality", which subtracts an extra mortality proportional to the square of the COTS density. This change aligns with the project context by providing a mechanism to moderate extreme outbreak   
 values and sustain realistic outbreak dynamics.

Below is our proposed set of changes. We are proposing three sets of updates:

1. **intention.txt:** We add our assessment and reasoning outlining our evaluation of the current model and our chosen improvement. In this case, we add a density‐dependent mortality term for COTS to capture added 
losses at high density (e.g. due to disease, competition, and cannibalism), which is ecologically justifiable given the project context.

2. **parameters.json:** We add a new parameter, `density_dependent_mortality`, with an initial value (0.001) and clear justification.

3. **model.cpp:** We update the COTS dynamics. First, we add the new parameter declaration after `coral_half_saturation`. Then, inside the time‐loop we calculate a new density‐dependent mortality term 
(`density_decay`) as `density_dependent_mortality * cots_pred[t-1]^2` and subtract it from the updated COTS population. We also ensure no current time step `_dat` values are used.

Please review the file paths and confirm so we can apply the following *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

 After evaluating the current model and residuals, it appears that while the logistic growth and outbreak trigger capture the boom‐bust dynamics of COTS, an important ecological process may be oversimplified:       
 additional mortality arising from increased density (e.g., due to disease, competition, or cannibalism) at high COTS numbers. To better represent these density‐dependent effects, we introduce a new term,           
 "density_dependent_mortality", which subtracts an extra mortality proportional to the square of the COTS density. This mechanism helps moderate extreme outbreak values and sustains realistic outbreak dynamics,     
 aligning well with the project context.
