Current model fits the data reasonably well overall but underestimates the delay prior to outbreak initiation. This suggests that an Allee effect—where low COTS densities suffer from inefficient reproduction—may be important. Introducing an allee_threshold parameter addresses this by reducing growth when populations are low, thereby better capturing the boom-bust dynamics observed in nature.
