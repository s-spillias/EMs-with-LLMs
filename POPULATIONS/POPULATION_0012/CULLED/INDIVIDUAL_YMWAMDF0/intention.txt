Assessment and Model Improvement Rationale:
--------------------------------------------
Residual analysis suggests that while the current model reasonably captures the timing of COTS outbreaks, the linear resource limitation in the logistic growth may be oversimplified. In reef ecosystems, nonlinear resource competition can intensify or diminish the slowdown as populations near carrying capacity.
To better represent this, we introduce a new parameter "resource_limitation_exponent" that allows flexible modulation of the logistic term. An exponent of 1 retains the original dynamics, whereas values >1 strengthen the limitation (yielding a sharper slowdown and potentially triggering burst dynamics) and values <1 soften the limitation. This change should enhance the model's ability to capture the rapid boom-bust cycles observed in COTS populations.
