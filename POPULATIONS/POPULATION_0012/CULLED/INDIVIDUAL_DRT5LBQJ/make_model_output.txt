Below is our proposed update based on the assessment. We found that while the current model captures outbreak dynamics, the logistic   
growth term (1 - cots_pred[t-1]/carrying_capacity) is linear. This may underestimate the strength of density‐dependent feedback at high
COTS densities. To better capture the system dynamics described in the PROJECT CONTEXT, we propose introducing a non‐linear            
intraspecific competition factor. In practice, we replace the linear term with a non-linear term (1 -                                  
(cots_pred[t-1]/carrying_capacity)^competition_exponent). A new parameter, competition_exponent, is added (with a default value of 2.0)
along with documentation in intention.txt and parameters.json.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 - The current model captures key outbreak dynamics but uses a linear logistic term that may underestimate density-dependent feedback  
 high COTS densities.                                                                                                                  
 - Residual patterns suggest that a stronger, non-linear intraspecific competition effect could better constrain growth when populatio 
 approach carrying capacity.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement:                                                                                                                          
 - We introduce a non-linear competition term by replacing the linear factor (1 - cots_pred[t-1]/carrying_capacity) with (1 -          
 pow(cots_pred[t-1]/(carrying_capacity + eps), competition_exponent)).                                                                 
 - The new parameter "competition_exponent" (default value 2.0) will intensify the density-dependent slowdown of growth at high COTS   
 densities, consistent with ecological observations.
