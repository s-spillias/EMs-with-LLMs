Assessment:
- The current model captures key outbreak dynamics but uses a linear logistic term that may underestimate density-dependent feedback at high COTS densities.
- Residual patterns suggest that a stronger, non-linear intraspecific competition effect could better constrain growth when populations approach carrying capacity.

Improvement:
- We introduce a non-linear competition term by replacing the linear factor (1 - cots_pred[t-1]/carrying_capacity) with (1 - pow(cots_pred[t-1]/(carrying_capacity + eps), competition_exponent)).
- The new parameter "competition_exponent" (default value 2.0) will intensify the density-dependent slowdown of growth at high COTS densities, consistent with ecological observations.
