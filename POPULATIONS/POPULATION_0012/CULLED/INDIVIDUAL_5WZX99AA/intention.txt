Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
1. The current model captures many key dynamics but residual analysis indicates that outbreak timing is imperfect.
2. Ecologically, high coral cover may enhance COTS outbreak susceptibility by providing more resources, and outbreaks could be triggered at a lower COTS population threshold when coral is abundant.
3. We introduce an indirect feedback by lowering the effective outbreak threshold based on the average of the previous time-stepâ€™s coral cover.
4. A new parameter, "coral_trigger_influence", scales this effect.
