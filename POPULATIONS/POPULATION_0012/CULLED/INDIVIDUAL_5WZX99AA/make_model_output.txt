Below are the proposed changes. We are implementing an indirect coral feedback into outbreak dynamics. In our assessment we found that 
residuals suggest that outbreak timing is not fully captured by a COTS‐only threshold. Ecologically, when coral cover is high the      
system is more vulnerable to COTS outbreaks, so we now lower the effective outbreak threshold as a function of the average coral cover 
(using the previous time‐step predictions). We introduce a new parameter, coral_trigger_influence, to scale this effect. In model.cpp  
we compute the average coral cover (from the previous step) and incorporate it into the outbreak trigger calculation. We also update   
intention.txt with our rationale and add the new parameter to parameters.json.

 Assessment and Improvement Rationale:                                                                                                 
 1. The current model captures many key dynamics but residual analysis indicates that outbreak timing is imperfect.                    
 2. Ecologically, high coral cover may enhance COTS outbreak susceptibility by providing more resources, and outbreaks could be        
 triggered at a lower COTS population threshold when coral is abundant.                                                                
 3. We introduce an indirect feedback by lowering the effective outbreak threshold based on the average of the previous time-step’s    
 coral cover.                                                                                                                          
 4. A new parameter, "coral_trigger_influence", scales this effect.

After applying these changes you might wish to re-run the model to evaluate whether the new indirect feedback improves the fit and     
ecological realism.
