[Assessment]
The current model captures the general boom-bust cycles of COTS but exhibits a relatively rigid outbreak trigger mechanism that may oversimplify the threshold dynamics observed in nature.
Residuals suggest the outbreak onset is not sufficiently steep compared to ecological observations.
To better reflect episodic outbreaks, we introduce a nonlinear enhancement in the decline rate when COTS numbers exceed a critical threshold.
This is achieved by adding a "trigger_nonlinearity" parameter to amplify the decline (representing steep, threshold‚Äêlike responses) once the population exceeds the outbreak threshold.
