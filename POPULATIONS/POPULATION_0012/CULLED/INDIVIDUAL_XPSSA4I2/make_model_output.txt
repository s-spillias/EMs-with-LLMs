Below are the proposed changes:                                                                                                                                                                                        

 1 Update the assessment in intention.txt with our evaluation and ecological reasoning.                                                                                                                                
 2 Add a new parameter trigger_nonlinearity to parameters.json with justification.                                                                                                                                     
 3 In model.cpp, add a new parameter definition for trigger_nonlinearity and modify the outbreak decline calculation to include a nonlinear amplification term based on excess COTS above the outbreak threshold.

 The current model captures the general boom-bust cycles of COTS but exhibits a relatively rigid outbreak trigger mechanism that may oversimplify the threshold dynamics observed in nature.                           
 Residuals suggest the outbreak onset is not sufficiently steep compared to ecological observations.                                                                                                                   
 To better reflect episodic outbreaks, we introduce a nonlinear enhancement in the decline rate when COTS numbers exceed a critical threshold.                                                                         
 This is achieved by adding a "trigger_nonlinearity" parameter to amplify the decline (representing steep, threshold‐like responses) once the population exceeds the outbreak threshold.

 1 We add clamping code at the end of each time step in the loop to ensure that none of the state predictions become negative. This prevents the occurrence of NA/NaN values that can disrupt the gradient computation.
