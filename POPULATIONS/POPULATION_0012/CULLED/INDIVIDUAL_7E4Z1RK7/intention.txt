Assessment and Rationale:
---------------------------------
The current model reasonably captures the overall dynamics of COTS outbreaks using logistic growth for population increase and predation losses on coral communities. However, the outbreak trigger function is linear with respect to the difference between COTS density and a fixed threshold (scaled by carrying capacity). In nature, outbreak events often exhibit a sharp, threshold‐like transition not well captured by a linear function.

Improvement:
A new parameter, "outbreak_trigger_exponent", has been introduced to apply a non‐linear exponent to the normalized COTS density in the outbreak trigger function. When the normalized density (COTS density divided by carrying capacity) is raised to an exponent greater than 1, even a small increase near the threshold can trigger a steep response. This modification is expected to better capture the timing and intensity of outbreak events, aligning with observed abrupt transitions in the ecological system.

Note: The model continues to use only previous time step predictions to avoid any data leakage.
