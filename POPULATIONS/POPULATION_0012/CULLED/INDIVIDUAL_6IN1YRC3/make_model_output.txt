Below is the plan we’ll follow:                                                                                                        

 1 intention.txt – We will update this file to document our assessment. Our appraisal finds that although the current model captures   
   the onset of COTS outbreaks via a logistic function, it does not sufficiently represent the rapid population collapse once the      
   outbreak peaks. In real-world epidemics, a strong density‐dependent mortality is observed past a threshold. Hence, we add a new     
   parameter, post_outbreak_acceleration, which increases the decline rate when COTS densities exceed a threshold. This change should  
   help the model better capture the boom‐bust dynamics described in the project context.                                              
 2 parameters.json – We will add a new parameter to represent the density‐dependent post‐outbreak acceleration, with clear ecological  
   reasoning.                                                                                                                          
 3 model.cpp – We will (a) declare the new parameter within the parameter section and (b) modify the outbreak decline calculation so   
   that when COTS densities exceed the threshold (outbreak_threshold * carrying_capacity), an additional quadratic term is added. This 
   additional term, scaled by post_outbreak_acceleration, accelerates the population decline and better represents the sudden collapse 
   after the outbreak peak. Also, we ensure that throughout the model all predictions rely solely on the state from the previous time  
   step.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 The current model employs logistic growth and an outbreak trigger function to represent the initiation of COTS outbreaks. While this  
 captures the outbreak onset, it does not fully reflect the rapid post-peak collapse observed in real-world data. In ecological system 
 once COTS densities exceed a threshold, density-dependent effects (e.g. strong competition and resource collapse) lead to a rapid     
 decline.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement:                                                                                                                          
 We introduce a new parameter, "post_outbreak_acceleration", which adds an extra, quadratic, density-dependent decline when COTS level 
 surpass the threshold (defined as "outbreak_threshold" * "carrying_capacity"). This additional term enhances the model’s realism by   
 capturing the rapid collapse phase typical of boom-bust dynamics in COTS outbreaks.
