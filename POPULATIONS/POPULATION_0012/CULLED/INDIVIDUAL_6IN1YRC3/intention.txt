Assessment:
The current model employs logistic growth and an outbreak trigger function to represent the initiation of COTS outbreaks. While this captures the outbreak onset, it does not fully reflect the rapid post-peak collapse observed in real-world data. In ecological systems, once COTS densities exceed a threshold, density-dependent effects (e.g. strong competition and resource collapse) lead to a rapid decline. 

Improvement:
We introduce a new parameter, "post_outbreak_acceleration", which adds an extra, quadratic, density-dependent decline when COTS levels surpass the threshold (defined as "outbreak_threshold" * "carrying_capacity"). This additional term enhances the model’s realism by capturing the rapid collapse phase typical of boom-bust dynamics in COTS outbreaks.

Reasoning:
• Improves the fit by better capturing the timing and magnitude of the population crash.
• Reflects ecological feedback mechanisms where extreme densities accelerate mortality.
• Provides a meaningful new lever for calibrating outbreak dynamics.
