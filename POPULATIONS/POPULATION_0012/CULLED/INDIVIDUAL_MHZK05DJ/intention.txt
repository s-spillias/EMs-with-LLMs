Assessment and Rationale:
--------------------------
Residuals analysis indicates that while the current model captures environmental forcing via SST and predation on corals, the density regulation of the COTS population appears oversimplified. The linear density-dependence assumed by the term (1 - cots_pred[t-1]/K) may not fully account for the abrupt declines observed following outbreak peaks.

Chosen Improvement:
Incorporate a higher-order, non-linear density dependence by introducing a new parameter `theta`. With theta > 1, the term (1 - pow(cots_pred[t-1] / (K + eps), theta)) amplifies the crowding effect at high COTS densities, thereby more realistically simulating the rapid bust after an outbreak. This change adheres to ecological intuitions where intraspecific competition and resource limitation become critical at high density.

Implementation:
- Updated `model.cpp` to use the non-linear density feedback with a power function.
- Added the `theta` parameter in `parameters.json` with ecological justification.
- Ensured that only previous time step values are used in accordance with best practices of avoiding data leakage.

This enhancement should improve the model's ability to capture the dynamics described in the project context, particularly the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations.
