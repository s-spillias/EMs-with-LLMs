Assessment:
The residuals indicate a slight systematic bias suggesting that the current outbreak trigger function may be overly simplistic.
We propose adding a quadratic term by introducing a new parameter "outbreak_nonlinearity". This change
allows for a sharper, non-linear transition in the outbreak trigger, reflecting synergistic ecological feedback mechanisms 
that can lead to sudden outbreak events. This improvement better captures the boom-bust cycle of COTS populations under varying environmental conditions.
