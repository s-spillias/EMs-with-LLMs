Assessment:
The current model fits the boom-bust dynamics reasonably well but appears to underestimate the rapid decline phase, suggesting that intraspecific competition may be stronger than represented. While key ecological processes are captured, the density-dependent regulation is oversimplified.

Improvement:
Introduce a non-linear density-dependent regulation in the COTS growth term. By adding a new parameter ("density_dependence") and using it as an exponent in the logistic term, we can account for intensified resource limitation and competition at high densities. This change is ecologically justified as it more accurately represents the collapse mechanism during outbreaks.
