MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model implements a mechanistic COTS-coral system with:
1. Temperature-dependent recruitment with Gaussian response
2. Nutrient-mediated larval survival threshold (outbreak trigger mechanism)
3. Age-structured mortality (juvenile vs adult)
4. Type II functional response for coral predation
5. Logistic growth for two coral functional groups

IDENTIFIED LIMITATIONS:
-----------------------
1. Fixed attack rates don't capture observed prey-switching behavior
2. COTS show strong preference for Acropora when abundant, but switch to massive corals when Acropora depletes
3. This behavioral flexibility is critical for:
   - Outbreak duration (continues even after preferred prey depleted)
   - Coral community composition shifts
   - Recovery dynamics post-outbreak

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT IMPLEMENTED:
-----------------------------------
Dynamic Prey Preference with Depletion-Driven Switching

MECHANISM:
- Base attack rates remain (log_attack_fast, log_attack_slow)
- Added preference modifier that increases fast coral attack rate when fast corals are abundant
- Preference declines sigmoidally as fast coral cover depletes
- This creates emergent prey-switching: Acropora targeted first, then massive corals

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
---------------------
1. log_preference_strength (dimensionless)
   - Controls magnitude of preference for fast-growing corals
   - Higher values = stronger preference when Acropora abundant
   - Bounds: -2.0 to 2.0 (allows weak to strong preference)

2. preference_threshold (% cover)
   - Fast coral cover level at which preference is half-maximal
   - Below this, COTS increasingly switch to massive corals
   - Bounds: 5.0 to 30.0 (ecologically reasonable depletion threshold)

3. log_preference_steepness (dimensionless)
   - Controls abruptness of prey-switching transition
   - Higher values = sharper switch from Acropora to massive corals
   - Bounds: -1.0 to 2.0 (gradual to abrupt switching)

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
----------------------------
Preference modifier = preference_strength / (1 + exp(-preference_steepness * (fast_coral - preference_threshold)))

Effective attack rates:
- attack_fast_effective = attack_fast * (1 + preference_modifier)
- attack_slow_effective = attack_slow * (1 - preference_modifier * 0.5)

This creates:
- Enhanced Acropora consumption when abundant (preference_modifier > 0)
- Reduced massive coral consumption when Acropora abundant (compensatory)
- Gradual shift to massive corals as Acropora depletes (preference_modifier â†’ 0)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
-------------------------
1. Observed COTS behavior: Strong Acropora preference in choice experiments
2. Field observations: Acropora depleted first during outbreaks
3. Outbreak persistence: COTS populations sustained on massive corals after Acropora loss
4. Community impacts: Differential recovery rates between coral types post-outbreak

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
----------------------
1. More realistic outbreak duration (sustained by prey switching)
2. Better capture of coral community composition changes
3. Improved prediction of which reefs experience prolonged vs brief outbreaks
4. More accurate representation of selective predation patterns

This modification maintains model parsimony while adding critical behavioral realism that directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT emphasis on selective predation and outbreak dynamics.
