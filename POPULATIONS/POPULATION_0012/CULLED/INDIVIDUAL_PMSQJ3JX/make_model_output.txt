Below are the proposed changes:                                                                                                        

Overview and rationale:                                                                                                                
After reviewing the model and the residual patterns, it appears that the current logistic outbreak trigger underestimates the abrupt   
onset of COTS outbreaks. Ecologically, we expect that once a critical density is reached, outbreak dynamics become highly non-linear.  
Therefore, a quadratic (second-order) term in the outbreak trigger is introduced (via a new parameter outbreak_acceleration) to        
intensify outbreak sensitivity. This change refines the model's ability to capture rapid and sudden outbreak events and is ecologically
justified as it better mirrors density‐dependent feedbacks in populations.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 The residual analysis indicates that the current model underestimates the abrupt onset of COTS outbreaks.                             
 While the logistic outbreak trigger captures some dynamics, the rapid transition seen in observed data suggests non‐linear feedbacks  
 that are currently oversimplified.                                                                                                    
 To address this, I have introduced a higher-order (quadratic) term in the outbreak trigger function, modulated by the new parameter   
 "outbreak_acceleration." This enhancement provides a steeper, more abrupt transition in outbreak initiation, better reflecting the    
 ecological processes behind boom-bust cycles observed in COTS dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef.

Once you confirm these changes, you can re-run your model to assess if the modified outbreak trigger improves the fit of the predicted 
boom-bust cycles against the observed data.                                                                                            

If you need further assistance, please let me know.
