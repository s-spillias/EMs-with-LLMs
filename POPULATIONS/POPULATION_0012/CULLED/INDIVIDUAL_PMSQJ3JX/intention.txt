Assessment:
The residual analysis indicates that the current model underestimates the abrupt onset of COTS outbreaks. 
While the logistic outbreak trigger captures some dynamics, the rapid transition seen in observed data suggests non‚Äêlinear feedbacks that are currently oversimplified.
To address this, I have introduced a higher-order (quadratic) term in the outbreak trigger function, modulated by the new parameter "outbreak_acceleration." This enhancement provides a steeper, more abrupt transition in outbreak initiation, better reflecting the ecological processes behind boom-bust cycles observed in COTS dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef.
