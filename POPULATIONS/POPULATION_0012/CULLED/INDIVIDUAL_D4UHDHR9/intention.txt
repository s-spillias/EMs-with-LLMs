MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model includes several important mechanisms for COTS outbreak dynamics:
- Allee effects for low-density population dynamics
- Density-dependent fecundity enhancement during outbreaks
- Temperature-dependent larval survival
- Nutrient-mediated recruitment enhancement (via SST anomaly proxy)
- Type II functional responses for coral predation

However, a critical ecological process is missing or oversimplified:

MISSING MECHANISM: Coral-dependent larval settlement and early survival
- Literature strongly supports that coral cover provides essential settlement substrate for COTS larvae
- Cryptic habitat in coral structure protects early juveniles from predation
- This creates a positive feedback: coral recovery → enhanced COTS recruitment → outbreak initiation
- Explains the characteristic 2-3 year lag between coral recovery and outbreak onset on GBR

CURRENT LIMITATION:
The nutrient effect (log_nutrient_effect) uses SST anomaly as a proxy for nutrient delivery, but this:
1. Conflates temperature stress with nutrient enhancement
2. Doesn't capture the coral-habitat feedback that triggers outbreaks
3. May produce unrealistic recruitment when combined with high baseline larval_survival (0.3)

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add a coral-dependent settlement modifier that scales larval recruitment with available coral habitat.

Mathematical form: Saturating function of total coral cover
- settlement_modifier = (total_coral^n) / (halfsat_coral^n + total_coral^n)
- Uses Hill function to capture threshold behavior
- At low coral: minimal settlement success (lack of substrate)
- At moderate coral: rapid increase in settlement (optimal habitat)
- At high coral: saturation (settlement sites no longer limiting)

Ecological justification:
1. MECHANISTIC: Coral provides physical settlement substrate and cryptic refuge
2. EMPIRICAL: GBR outbreaks correlate with prior coral recovery periods
3. DYNAMIC: Creates realistic boom-bust timing through delayed positive feedback
4. THRESHOLD: Explains why outbreaks require minimum coral cover to initiate

New parameters required:
- log_settlement_halfsat: Coral cover at which settlement enhancement reaches 50% of maximum
- settlement_exponent: Hill coefficient controlling threshold sharpness (cooperativity)

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding a well-supported mechanism that directly addresses the PROJECT CONTEXT goal of capturing outbreak timing and triggers.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Replace or modify the nutrient effect to focus on coral-habitat feedback
- Adjust baseline larval_survival downward to compensate for new enhancement
- Use total coral cover (fast + slow) as the settlement substrate metric
- Parameter bounds should reflect realistic coral cover ranges (0-100%) and typical Hill coefficients (1-4)
