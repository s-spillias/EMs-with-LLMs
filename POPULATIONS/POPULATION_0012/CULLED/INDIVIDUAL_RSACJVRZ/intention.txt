Assessment:
After reviewing the residuals and model performance, it appears that the current outbreak trigger function—which uses a simple linear environmental modifier—does not fully capture the non‐linear impact environmental conditions can have on outbreak initiation. Environmental effects may be amplified or diminished in a non‐linear fashion. To improve ecological realism, we have added a new parameter, "environmental_exponent", that allows the environmental modifier to be raised to a power. This change enables more flexible calibration of outbreak sensitivity to environmental conditions.
