Assessment:
The current model generally fits the data but residuals indicate that when coral cover is very low, the recovery process seems overestimated. This suggests that the recovery of coral communities may be subject to a critical threshold – a tipping point – beyond which the reef structure is too degraded to allow effective regeneration.
Improvement Chosen:
We introduce a "coral tipping threshold" parameter. When coral cover falls below this threshold (set to 30% by default), coral recovery is proportionally reduced. Ecologically, this captures the notion that severe habitat degradation impairs coral regeneration, further reinforcing boom-bust dynamics in COTS outbreaks.
