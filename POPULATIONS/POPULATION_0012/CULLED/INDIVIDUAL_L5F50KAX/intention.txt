Assessment and Improvement:
The current model effectively captures the boom-bust cycle by modelling logistic COTS growth and an outbreak-triggered decline. However, it currently lacks a feedback mechanism whereby a healthy fast‐growing coral community mitigates the outbreak intensity. Ecologically, resilient coral cover can dampen the severity of COTS outbreaks by enhancing reef resilience.
To address this, we add a new parameter, "coral_control_on_outbreak", which reduces the outbreak trigger via an exponential decay term based on the previous time step’s fast-growing coral cover. This modification enhances the model’s ability to accurately predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreak events while strictly using previous state values for predictions.
