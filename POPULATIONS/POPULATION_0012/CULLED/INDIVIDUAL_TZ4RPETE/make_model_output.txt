Below is our plan:                                                                                                                     

 1 Intention Update: We document our assessment and reasoning in POPULATIONS/POPULATION_0012/INDIVIDUAL_TZ4RPETE/intention.txt. We     
   explain that although the model uses a logistic‐growth and Michaelis–Menten function for resource limitation, it omits a key direct 
   feedback – that the coral cover itself may modify outbreak initiation. We add an extra parameter, outbreak_coral_sensitivity,       
   reflecting how high coral availability may enhance outbreak triggering while low coral cover retards it. This ecological feedback   
   aligns with observed dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef.                                                                            
 2 Model Improvement in model.cpp:                                                                                                     
   a. Insert a new parameter outbreak_coral_sensitivity (using previous state values only).                                            
   b. Update the outbreak trigger function to include the additional coral feedback term (using the previous time step’s combined coral
   cover).                                                                                                                             
 3 Parameter Addition in parameters.json:                                                                                              
   Add a new JSON parameter entry for outbreak_coral_sensitivity with ecological justification.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                           
 The current model effectively captures many dynamics such as logistic COTS growth, saturating resource limitation, and outbreak trigg 
 dynamics using a sigmoidal function. However, the model misses an ecological feedback: empirical evidence indicates that outbreak     
 initiation is also sensitive to coral cover. When coral cover is high, increased food availability may facilitate outbreak onset, whi 
 low coral cover may inhibit it.                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                       
 Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                   
 We have added a new parameter, "outbreak_coral_sensitivity", to modulate outbreak trigger sensitivity based on the combined coral cov 
 from fast- and slow-growing components. The outbreak trigger equation in model.cpp is modified such that its effective steepness now  
 also depends on the deviation of coral availability (computed from predicted coral cover) from a threshold (here, 0.5 in normalized   
 units). This modification introduces a non-linear feedback mechanism that better captures the observed episodic outbreak dynamics.
