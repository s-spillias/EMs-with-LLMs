Assessment:
The current model effectively captures many dynamics such as logistic COTS growth, saturating resource limitation, and outbreak trigger dynamics using a sigmoidal function. However, the model misses an ecological feedback: empirical evidence indicates that outbreak initiation is also sensitive to coral cover. When coral cover is high, increased food availability may facilitate outbreak onset, while low coral cover may inhibit it.

Chosen Improvement:
We have added a new parameter, "outbreak_coral_sensitivity", to modulate outbreak trigger sensitivity based on the combined coral cover from fast- and slow-growing components. The outbreak trigger equation in model.cpp is modified such that its effective steepness now also depends on the deviation of coral availability (computed from predicted coral cover) from a threshold (here, 0.5 in normalized units). This modification introduces a non-linear feedback mechanism that better captures the observed episodic outbreak dynamics.
