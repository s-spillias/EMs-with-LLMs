Project Assessment:
The current model fairly captures outbreak initiation and decline, including resource limitation through a saturating function of coral availability and environmental modifiers affecting outbreak triggers.

However, the recovery dynamics for fast-growing and slow-growing corals are modeled independently using (100 - individual coral cover), which neglects the competitive interaction for limited substrate. In reality, both coral types compete for space; as one occupies more space, the recovery potential for the other is reduced.

Ecological Justification:
- Incorporates competition for substrate among corals.
- Reflects the limited available reef area, enhancing the realism of coral recovery dynamics during and after outbreaks.
- Provides a more integrated mechanism, ensuring that total coral cover does not exceed the maximum available space.

This change improves ecological realism without adding new parameters.
