Assessment and Rationale:
--------------------------
The current model captures the basic logistic growth and outbreak dynamics for COTS as well as their predation on coral; however, it lacks an explicit density‐dependent mortality term. Given the project context of modeling episodic outbreaks with boom‐bust cycles, high COTS densities likely induce additional mortality due to resource limitation and competition. 

We have therefore chosen to implement a quadratic mortality term in the COTS dynamics. The new parameter "overcrowding_mortality" will scale with the square of the previous COTS population, thereby representing increased mortality when densities are elevated. This improvement ensures that the model more realistically simulates the outbreak duration and collapse phase, aligning with the ecological feedback mechanisms expected in actual reef systems.
