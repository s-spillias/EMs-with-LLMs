Assessment:
1. The current model captures key outbreak dynamics and coral predation, but the Holling type II formulation for coral predation (using an exponent on the ratio of coral cover) appears to overestimate predation efficiency at low coral cover, as indicated by residuals analyses.
2. To better capture the episodic outbreak behavior of COTS, a Holling type III (sigmoidal) predation response is proposed. This ensures that predation remains low when coral cover is very low and increases more gradually.
3. This adjustment is ecologically justified, since it provides a more realistic representation of prey‚Äêdependent predator behavior and maintains the use of only previous time step values.
