[Assessment]
The current model reproduces the characteristic boom‐bust cycles, yet residual analysis indicates that the outbreak trigger is not sensitive enough to capture the rapid transition in COTS densities observed in the data.

[Chosen Improvement]
We add a cubic term (parameter: outbreak_quadratic) to the outbreak trigger function to further enhance nonlinearity at high COTS densities. Ecologically, this adjustment reflects the potential for a rapid, self‐accelerating outbreak once COTS exceed a critical density, leading to a more abrupt transition in population dynamics.
