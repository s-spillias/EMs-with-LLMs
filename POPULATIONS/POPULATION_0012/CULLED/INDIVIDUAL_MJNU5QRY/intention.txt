Assessment and Improvement Reasoning:
--------------------------------------
1. Assessment:
   - The current model uses logistic growth for COTS and a sigmoid outbreak trigger.
   - Residuals indicate the decline phase may be too gradual.
   - The model uses only previous time step values, avoiding data leakage.

2. Chosen Improvement:
   - Introduce quadratic density dependence in the outbreak-triggered decline.
   - Rationale: At high COTS densities, increased competition and resource depletion lead to a sharper decline. This change better captures the rapid collapse following outbreaks observed in ecological data.

Change Summary:
   - Modify the decline term in the model from linear in COTS density to quadratic (i.e. using pow(cots_pred[t-1], 2)).
