In this update we note that while the current model captures boom‐bust cycles and COTS–coral interactions reasonably well, the saturating function for coral availability is oversimplified. Residual analysis indicates that the model may benefit from a more flexible, non‐linear representation of how coral cover limits COTS growth. 

To address this, we introduce a new parameter, resource_exponent, to allow a polynomial (non‐linear) response in the saturating function. This change lets us model scenarios where high coral cover more strongly inhibits COTS growth (or vice versa) depending on the exponent value. The modification does not use current time step response values, thus avoiding data leakage. 

This added complexity is ecologically justified as it better captures the response of COTS populations under varying coral resource conditions.
