Assessment:
The model fits the boombust dynamics of COTS, but the coral recovery dynamics did not account for interspecific competition for limited substrate. In reality, fast-growing (Acropora) and slow-growing (Faviidae/Porites) corals compete for space on the reef. By revising the recovery terms to depend on the available substrate (100 - [fast + slow coral cover]), this change introduces an important ecological constraint.
Reasoning:
– Accurately captures the reduction in available substrate as total coral cover increases.
– Better reflects spatial competition and resource limitation in coral recovery.
– Avoids using current observations, only previous state values, ensuring no data leakage.
