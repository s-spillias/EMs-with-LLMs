Assessment:
The current model fits the data reasonably well but does not explicitly incorporate resource limitation driven by coral availability. While the logistic growth term captures density dependence, it assumes a fixed carrying capacity for COTS regardless of the coral state.

To better capture the dynamics described in the PROJECT CONTEXT, we have introduced a mechanism where the effective carrying capacity for COTS is modulated by total coral cover (combining fast-growing and slow-growing coral percentages). With reduced coral cover, available resources decline, thereby limiting COTS growth and providing an important ecological feedback.

Change:
- In model.cpp, the logistic growth term now uses an effective carrying capacity that scales with ((fast_pred + slow_pred)/200).
- A new parameter "coral_availability_scaler" has been added to parameters.json to allow further tuning of this effect.
