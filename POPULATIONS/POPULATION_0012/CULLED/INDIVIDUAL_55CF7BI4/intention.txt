Assessment: The current model uses logistic growth with a smooth outbreak-triggered decline based on a fixed threshold (0.5 * carrying_capacity), which oversimplifies outbreak dynamics. Residual analysis indicates mismatches in the timing and magnitude of outbreaks.

Improvement: A new parameter 'outbreak_threshold' has been introduced. Instead of a fixed threshold, the outbreak trigger now depends on the normalized COTS population (cots_pred[t-1] / carrying_capacity) compared against outbreak_threshold. This modification better reflects ecological realities in which outbreak initiation is influenced by relative population densities and environmental conditions.
