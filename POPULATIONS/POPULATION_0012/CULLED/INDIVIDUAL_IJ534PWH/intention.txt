Assessment:
The current model reasonably predicts the burst‐bust dynamics of COTS; however, the linear treatment of coral availability in modulating COTS growth oversimplifies the ecological reality. In natural systems, the influence of resource availability typically saturates, meaning that after a certain point additional coral cover yields diminishing additional population benefits.
To address this, we have implemented a Michaelis–Menten type saturating function in the COTS growth equation. This improvement captures the nonlinear resource limitation effect and ensures that the model more accurately reflects the ecological processes that trigger and sustain outbreak events.
