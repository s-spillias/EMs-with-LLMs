Assessment and Improvement Notes:
---------------------------------
1. Evaluation: Residuals indicate that the current model underestimates the persistence of outbreak conditions. Although the model incorporates logistic growth, resource limitation, and non-linear outbreak triggering through outbreak_shape, it lacks a mechanism to capture the delayed decline often observed in COTS population explosions.
2. Ecological Justification: In natural COTS outbreaks, once an outbreak is triggered, ecosystem inertia and cumulative effects sustain the outbreak conditions longer even if conditions begin to revert. This hysteresis effect is critical for reproducing the observed boom-bust cycles.
3. Chosen Improvement: Introduce an outbreak hysteresis parameter that modifies the outbreak trigger. Ecologically, this represents delayed feedback mechanisms, ensuring that once an outbreak is underway, the decline is not immediate but rather gradual, consistent with field observations.
