Below are the proposed changes. I made the following improvements:                                                                     

 1 In intention.txt, I documented an assessment noting that while the current model captures several outbreak features, it lacks a     
   hysteresis mechanism to account for delayed outbreak decline – a key ecological process observed in COTS cycles.                    
 2 In parameters.json, I added a new parameter outbreak_hysteresis that explicitly quantifies this delayed feedback.                   
 3 In model.cpp, I inserted the new parameter declaration and then modified the outbreak trigger calculation to include a hysteresis   
   effect by adding a correction term based on the new parameter.

 Assessment and Improvement Notes:                                                                                                     
 ---------------------------------                                                                                                     
 1. Evaluation: Residuals indicate that the current model underestimates the persistence of outbreak conditions. Although the model    
 incorporates logistic growth, resource limitation, and non-linear outbreak triggering through outbreak_shape, it lacks a mechanism to 
 capture the delayed decline often observed in COTS population explosions.                                                             
 2. Ecological Justification: In natural COTS outbreaks, once an outbreak is triggered, ecosystem inertia and cumulative effects susta 
 the outbreak conditions longer even if conditions begin to revert. This hysteresis effect is critical for reproducing the observed    
 boom-bust cycles.                                                                                                                     
 3. Chosen Improvement: Introduce an outbreak hysteresis parameter that modifies the outbreak trigger. Ecologically, this represents   
 delayed feedback mechanisms, ensuring that once an outbreak is underway, the decline is not immediate but rather gradual, consistent  
 with field observations.
