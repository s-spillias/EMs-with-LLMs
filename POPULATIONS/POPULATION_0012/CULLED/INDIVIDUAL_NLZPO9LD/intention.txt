Assessment:
The current model captures outbreak dynamics with logistic growth and a smoothly triggered decline, but it does not directly account for the resource (i.e. coral) availability that may fuel or constrain outbreak intensity. Ecologically, abundant coral can enhance COTS growth whereas coral depletion could limit outbreak magnitude. 

Improvement:
We introduce a non-linear, saturating coral resource effect on the COTS growth term by incorporating the previous time stepâ€™s fast and slow coral predictions. A new parameter, "coral_resource_scaler", scales this effect, ensuring that COTS growth is dynamically modulated by coral cover. This adds ecological realism to the boom-bust cycle predictions.
