 1 In intention.txt, we will document our assessment. The new text summarizes that the current model fits the general dynamics but underestimates the non‐linear sensitivity of outbreak initiation. We now introduce a new parameter named outbreak_nonlinearity that acts as an exponent on the difference between COTS density and the outbreak threshold, resulting in a more      
   graded trigger response that better captures the ecological feedbacks of outbreak processes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
 2 In parameters.json, we add a new parameter object for outbreak_nonlinearity (with a default value of 2.0). The description clarifies its ecological role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 3 In model.cpp, we add the new parameter to the parameter block so that it can be used in the outbreak trigger calculation. Then, we update the outbreak trigger calculation so that instead of a linear difference, we now use the difference raised to the outbreak_nonlinearity power. This change is motivated by the need for a more flexible, non‐linear trigger that better    
   fits the data (as seen in the residuals) and reflects the complex ecological processes driving outbreaks.

 After evaluating the model and examining the residuals, it appears that while the boom-bust dynamics are broadly captured, the timing and magnitude of outbreak events are not fully resolved. In particular, the current linear outbreak trigger does not capture the increasingly sensitive response as COTS numbers surpass the outbreak threshold.                                
 To address this, we introduce a polynomial component by adding a new parameter, "outbreak_nonlinearity". This parameter modulates the outbreak trigger by applying a non-linear (power-law) transformation to the difference between the current COTS population and the outbreak threshold. Ecologically, this reflects that outbreak initiation may become progressively more likel 
 once a critical population density is surpassed.
