Assessment and Reasoning:
After evaluating the model and examining the residuals, it appears that while the boom-bust dynamics are broadly captured, the timing and magnitude of outbreak events are not fully resolved. In particular, the current linear outbreak trigger does not capture the increasingly sensitive response as COTS numbers surpass the outbreak threshold.
To address this, we introduce a polynomial component by adding a new parameter, "outbreak_nonlinearity". This parameter modulates the outbreak trigger by applying a non-linear (power-law) transformation to the difference between the current COTS population and the outbreak threshold. Ecologically, this reflects that outbreak initiation may become progressively more likely once a critical population density is surpassed.
