  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZD-style model that preserves the core ecological roles from the TRUTH NPZ: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth, mortality terms, and physical mixing of nutrients. However the mathematical details differ in many places: phytoplankton growth is represented as multiplicative Monod (N) \u00d7 saturating light (Monod on an exponentially self-shaded irradiance) with an additional smooth nutrient-gate; grazing uses a generic Holling/Beddington\u2013DeAngelis functional response with exponent h_exp and predator interference (c_BD) instead of the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form; recycling is routed through an explicit detrital/DOM pool (D) with remineralization and export rather than instantaneous recycling terms; rates are temperature-scaled (Q10) and assimilation efficiency is nutrient-dependent. In sum: all canonical roles are present except phytoplankton physical mixing/entrainment (explicit k*P loss) is missing, and recycling is implemented via a new detritus pool (delayed remineralization) rather than the TRUTH instantaneous recycling terms.",
