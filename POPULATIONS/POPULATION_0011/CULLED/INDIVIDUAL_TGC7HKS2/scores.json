  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ with all canonical fluxes (uptake, recycling, mixing; growth, grazing, mortality, mixing). Many terms are implemented as common alternate formulations from the literature rather than exact algebraic matches to the TRUTH model. The main differences are: (1) explicit Monod nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit light limitation (with self-shading) and a smooth nutrient gate instead of the TRUTH's single combined N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP)) factor; (2) a Holling-type grazing with flexible exponent and a Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference denominator rather than the TRUTH's fixed P^2/(mu^2+P^2) predator functional response; (3) additional ecological refinements (temperature Q10 scaling, variable assimilation efficiency, quadratic mortality for both P and Z, and explicit Z mixing) that are not present in the TRUTH model.",
