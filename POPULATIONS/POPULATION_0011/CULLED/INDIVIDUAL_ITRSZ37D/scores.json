  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ dynamical model with all core fluxes (nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling, mixing) but uses a different parameterization and many additional ecological modifiers compared to the TRUTH Python NPZ. Uptake/growth are cast as a Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by a separate light limitation and a Q10 temperature multiplier (i.e., mu_max * Theta_T * N/(K_N+N) * LI), rather than the TRUTH's single combined term (N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c*P))*P. Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type function with an explicit order parameter h (generalized Holling), assimilation efficiency is nutrient-dependent (beta_eff), and mortality includes both linear and quadratic components. Physical mixing of nutrients is present and is structurally equivalent to TRUTH's relaxation term, but phytoplankton mixing/loss via entrainment in the candidate is absent. Overall, the candidate matches the TRUTH in ecological roles but uses alternate, literature-supported formulations for many components (Monod uptake, Holling grazing, linear+quadratic mortality) and adds seasonal light forcing, temperature (Q10) effects, variable assimilation efficiency, explicit excretion, stoichiometric yield, and explicit routing fractions for remineralization.",
