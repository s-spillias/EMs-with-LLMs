Assessment of the current model and parameterization

Fit quality
- The residuals file was not included in the provided files, so I cannot quantitatively evaluate model fit or diagnose systematic biases. Please provide the residuals to refine this assessment.
- General expectations: If the current model overpredicts phytoplankton during high-light periods or underpredicts during low-light periods, this typically indicates missing light-dependent features (e.g., photoinhibition at high irradiance or seasonal/diurnal light forcing). If zooplankton is misfit at high prey densities, functional response or interference terms might need refinement.

Model alignment with the project context
- The model explicitly simulates N, P, Z in a mixed layer using:
  - Phytoplankton growth limited by both nutrient (Hill/Monod) and light (saturating) with Q10 thermal scaling.
  - Zooplankton ingestion with a sigmoidal (Holling type III-like) functional response and Beddington-DeAngelis interference; zooplankton growth via fixed assimilation efficiency.
  - Background and self-shading light attenuation.
  - Vertical mixing to a deep nutrient reservoir.
  - Lognormal observation likelihoods and smooth penalties for soft bounds.
- This structure is appropriate for a simple mixed-layer NPZ system and reflects key first-order processes: resource limitation, grazing, recycling, and physical input via mixing.

Potential missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Light photoinhibition: At very high irradiance, growth can decline due to photodamage/photoinhibition. Current fI is purely saturating, so it cannot capture a decline at high light.
- Variable assimilation efficiency: e_Z is constant; in nature, it varies with prey quality (stoichiometry), temperature, and ingestion rate.
- Detrital pathway and time-lagged remineralization: All non-assimilated ingestion goes immediately to dissolved nutrients; in reality, a portion passes through detritus/DOM with finite remineralization time.
- Time-varying environmental drivers: I0 and temperature could vary seasonally/diurnally; model currently treats them as constant parameters.
- Dynamic mixed layer depth: k_Ibg encapsulates optical depth implicitly; MLD variability could improve realism if data are available.

Parameter review
- Most parameters are “initial estimate” or “literature”; one (K_g) is marked “updated from literature” in source but flagged as updated_from_literature=false. If more recent literature values exist (e.g., for mu_max, K_N, e_Z), we may need to revisit functional forms and scaling.
- Current bounds are reasonable and broadly consistent with mixed-layer NPZ literature ranges.
- No immediate evidence here that the equation structure is invalidated by a specific updated parameter value, but the lack of photoinhibition remains a likely structural gap for high-light regimes.

Chosen improvement: add light photoinhibition to phytoplankton growth
Rationale
- In mixed layers under strong insolation, phytoplankton growth can decrease at high light due to photodamage (photoinhibition). A saturating light-response cannot represent this decline, often leading to positive bias in P during high-light periods.
- Adding an exponential photoinhibition factor provides a flexible, minimal-complexity modification that does not add state variables and preserves the original behavior when the coefficient is zero.

Mathematical form
- Current light limitation: fI = I_eff / (K_I + I_eff)
- Proposed with photoinhibition:
  fI = (I_eff / (K_I + I_eff)) * exp(-k_phot * I_eff)
  where:
  - I_eff = I0 * exp(-(k_Ibg + k_Ishade * P))
  - k_phot ≥ 0 is a new parameter (units: per relative light unit)
- When k_phot = 0, the original model is recovered. For k_phot > 0, growth declines at high irradiance.
- This preserves fI ∈ [0, 1], maintains smoothness for AD, and requires only one new parameter.

Implementation details
- Add new parameter k_phot with bounds [0, 2] (dimensionless per relative light unit). Initial value 0.0 retains the original behavior.
- Modify model.cpp to multiply the light-saturation factor by the photoinhibition term exp(-k_phot * I_eff).
- Include k_phot in the soft-bound penalties.
- No changes to state variables or likelihood structure. No use of current-time observations in predictions.

Next steps with residuals
- Once residuals are available, test whether high-light periods show positive P bias; if so, fit should improve with k_phot > 0.
- If residuals indicate temperature-driven biases, consider temperature dependence for remineralization or variable e_Z as a next incremental refinement.
