  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements all core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing for N; phytoplankton growth, grazing losses, mortality; zooplankton growth and mortality) but many are implemented as literature alternates or extended formulations. Nutrient uptake is a Hill/Monod-style limiter coupled to an explicit P_growth and a yield conversion (y_PN). Phytoplankton growth includes explicit light limitation (saturating + photoinhibition and self-shading) and temperature Q10 scaling that are not present in the TRUTH model. Grazing is a sigmoidal Holling-like form with Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference rather than the TRUTH's simple P^2/(mu^2+P^2) predation term. Recycling is present but routed through P_losses/Z_losses and unassimilated grazing; mixing for nutrients is a direct match (k_mix*(N_deep-N)). Important omissions relative to TRUTH: the candidate does not include an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for P or Z (TRUTH had a term (s + k)*P in dP and no explicit Z mixing). Overall the candidate is broadly ecologically coherent and uses richer process detail (light, Q10, BD-interference, yield, quadratic mortality) that can reproduce the TRUTH form for particular parameter choices (e.g., h_exp=2, c_BD=0, fI=1, theta's=1, y_PN set appropriately), but it is not a literal algebraic match to the TRUTH equations.",
