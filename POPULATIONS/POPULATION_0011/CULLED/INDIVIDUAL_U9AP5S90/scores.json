  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical NPZ roles (uptake, recycling, mixing, growth, grazing, mortality) but with different functional choices and additional environmental forcing. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by explicit light and temperature modifiers (Q10 and seasonal cosine light). Grazing is implemented as a general Hill/Holling-type functional response (P^h/(K^h+P^h)) with an assimilation efficiency returning a fraction of grazed carbon to N. Zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms (density-dependent), and mixing is applied to the nutrient pool (N) in the same form as TRUTH. Compared to the TRUTH code, the candidate therefore matches most ecological roles but uses alternates for uptake/growth/grazing and adds explicit seasonal temperature and light forcing and quadratic zooplankton mortality.",
