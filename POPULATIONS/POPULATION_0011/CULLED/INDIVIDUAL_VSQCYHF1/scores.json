  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ with all core biomass compartments and most canonical flows (nutrient uptake, remineralization, grazing-mediated Z growth, mortality). Many functional forms are from common alternate families (Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, saturating light, Holling-type grazing, linear+quadratic mortality). The candidate adds several mechanistic refinements not in the TRUTH script (explicit light pool with self-shading, Q10 temperature scaling, smooth nutrient threshold gating, explicit yield converting P_growth to N uptake, and quadratic mortality terms). Numerically the candidate uses an Euler-forward integrator with smooth non-negativity and a lognormal observational model; TRUTH uses an ODE solver (solve_ivp) with different algebraic growth/grazing forms.",
