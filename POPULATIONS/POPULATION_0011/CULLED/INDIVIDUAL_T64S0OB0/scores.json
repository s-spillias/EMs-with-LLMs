  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ structure and captures all core mass flows (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth \u2192 remineralization) but with different functional choices and added ecological processes. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten style saturating term within P_growth (and uptake computed as P_growth / y_PN). Grazing is a flexible Holling-type with exponent and Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference; zooplankton growth uses an assimilation efficiency. The candidate adds explicit light limitation (with self-shading), a smooth nutrient-threshold gating, Q10 temperature scaling, a separate yield parameter linking uptake to growth, and quadratic mortality terms. Nutrient mixing/entrainment matches the TRUTH form, but phytoplankton and zooplankton mixing terms present in the TRUTH are not represented in the candidate. Overall: core ecology present and recognizable, many components are ALTERNATE formulations relative to TRUTH, and several extra processes are introduced.",
