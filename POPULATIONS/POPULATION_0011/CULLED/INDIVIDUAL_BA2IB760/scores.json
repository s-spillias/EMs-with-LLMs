  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with richer parameterizations and numerical safeguards. Uptake is Monod-like combined with an explicit self-shading term (so functionally the same ecological role as TRUTH uptake but different algebraic form and with a seasonal multiplier). Recycling is explicit and decomposed (egestion, growth-inefficiency, mortality routing) rather than the few aggregated recycling terms in TRUTH. Mixing of nutrients is implemented identically to TRUTH. Grazing is a Holling-type saturating response like TRUTH but includes a smooth prey-refuge/threshold and a tunable exponent \u03bd. Phytoplankton mortality is linear (matching TRUTH), but the candidate omits a direct phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss term present in TRUTH. Zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms (TRUTH has only linear). The model also adds seasonality (env modifier), explicit assimilation/yield and detailed recycling fractions, and a prey-threshold \u2014 extra processes not present in the TRUTH file.",
