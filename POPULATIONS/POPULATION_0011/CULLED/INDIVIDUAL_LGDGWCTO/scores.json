  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same core NPZ logic (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-mediated trophic transfer, recycling, and physical mixing of nutrients) but with more mechanistic detail and extra processes. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten-style limitation combined with an explicit yield (U_N = G_P / y_P). Grazing uses a Holling-type saturating functional response with a tunable exponent h (so it can reproduce the TRUTH P^2 Holling-III when h=2). Recycling is present but routed differently (mortality routing fractions rho_P/rho_Z and (1-beta)*G); zooplankton excretion is explicitly represented and not automatically routed to N in the same way as the TRUTH model. The candidate also includes explicit seasonal light forcing (I0, I_amp, LI) and a temperature Q10 multiplier (Theta_T) applied to rates \u2014 processes not present in the TRUTH code. Overall, most canonical roles are present; some match the TRUTH functional forms closely (grazing, zooplankton growth, mixing of N), others use common alternates (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake with yield, linear+quadratic mortalities) or omit a TRUTH term (phytoplankton mixing term).",
