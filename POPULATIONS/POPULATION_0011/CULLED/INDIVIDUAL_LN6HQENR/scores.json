  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a mechanistic NPZ with all three state equations and most canonical ecological processes present, but organized in a more generic and modular way than the TRUTH Python model. Key commonalities: both models include Monod/Michaelis\u2013Menten type nutrient limitation on phytoplankton growth, a saturating grazing term that transfers carbon to zooplankton with an assimilation efficiency, recycling of unassimilated grazing and mortality to dissolved nutrients, and a linear mixing/relaxation term for nutrients. Major differences / additions in the candidate vs TRUTH: explicit seasonal drivers for light and temperature (with a Q10 temperature modifier), an explicit yield (y_P) linking phytoplankton growth and nutrient uptake, optional quadratic mortality terms for P and Z, and an explicit zooplankton excretion term. Grazing and uptake functional forms are implemented in an intentionally flexible family (Holling with general order h, Monod LN and LI) so they match TRUTH conceptually but are not algebraically identical except for special parameter choices (e.g., h=2).",
