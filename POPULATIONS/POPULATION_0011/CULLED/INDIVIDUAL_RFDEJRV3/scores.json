  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ structure with nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling and explicit mixing of nutrients. Key canonical processes are present but several are implemented with alternate (and sometimes broader) formulations compared with the TRUTH Python NPZ. The grazing (Holling-type sigmoidal) and zooplankton assimilation-to-growth terms map closely to TRUTH; nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use Michaelis\u2011Menten style N-limitation but add an explicit light module, a smooth nutrient-threshold gating and stoichiometric yield (y_PN). The candidate also adds temperature (Q10) scaling and optional quadratic density-dependent mortality for P and Z. Notable omission relative to TRUTH: the candidate does not include an explicit mixing loss term for P or Z (TRUTH had mixing applied to P via -(s+k)*P), it applies mixing only to the nutrient pool.",
