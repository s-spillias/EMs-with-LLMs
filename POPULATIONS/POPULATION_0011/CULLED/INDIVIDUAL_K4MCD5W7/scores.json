  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ with the canonical ecological roles (nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality, mixing) but using a richer, more mechanistic/parameterized formulation than the simple TRUTH code. Nutrient uptake is implemented as Monod-limited phytoplankton growth (with an explicit yield converting growth to uptake) and an explicit light limitation and temperature Q10 multiplier; grazing is a generalized Holling (h) form with Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference and explicit assimilation; recycling includes egestion from grazing and routing of mortality back to nutrients; mixing is a standard relaxation to an external nutrient reservoir. Several processes present in the candidate are not in the TRUTH model (seasonal light forcing, Q10 temperature modifier, BD interference, explicit excretion and quadratic mortality terms, explicit yield), so the candidate is an ALTERNATE/superset of TRUTH rather than an exact match.",
