Assessment summary:
- Fit to data: A quantitative assessment is pending because no residuals file was provided. Please share it to verify systematic biases (e.g., seasonal over/under-shoots, amplitude errors, timing mismatches).
- Project context match: The current NPZ structure with seasonal light and temperature, saturating nutrient and light limitation, Holling-type grazing, mortality and remineralization, and simple mixing is aligned with a mixed-layer plankton system.
- Potential gaps/oversimplifications:
  - Light environment lacks density-dependent attenuation by phytoplankton (self-shading). This negative feedback is important during bloom buildup and termination.
  - A single Q10 modulates both primary production and grazing; literature often supports higher temperature sensitivity of grazing than growth.
  - Mixing is constant; real mixed layers show strong seasonality/intermittency.
  - No detrital pool; all losses route to dissolved nutrient, which can over-accelerate recycling.
  - Fixed assimilation efficiency; could vary with temperature or prey quality (not modeled here).

Parameter review:
- parameters.json flags all values as not updated from literature; no structural inconsistencies arise from recent updates. Ranges are broadly reasonable for temperate systems.

Chosen single improvement (implemented):
- Add phytoplankton self-shading of light via Beer-Lambert attenuation.
  - Ecological reasoning: As phytoplankton biomass increases, water column light decreases. This reduces growth at high P, a common mechanism limiting bloom magnitude and aiding bloom termination in stratified mixed layers.
  - Mathematical change:
    - I_surf(t) = I0 * (1 + I_amp * sin(2π·t/365 + phi_I))
    - I(t) = I_surf(t) · exp(-alpha_I · Pprev)
    - LI = I / (K_I + I)
  - Data usage: Pprev is the previous-step model state, avoiding data leakage.
  - Expected impact on residuals: If residuals show overprediction of P during high-light seasons or overly sharp bloom peaks, self-shading should reduce positive residuals in those periods and improve phase/amplitude realism.

New/modified parameters:
- alpha_I (units: (g C m^-3)^-1)
  - Description: Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient; attenuates light as exp(-alpha_I · P).
  - Initial value: 0.3
  - Bounds: lower_bound = 0.0, upper_bound = 10.0
  - Justification: Scales the strength of density-dependent light reduction; broad upper bound allows estimation from data without overconstraining.

Notes and future options (not implemented here to keep changes focused):
- Consider process-specific temperature sensitivities (Q10 for growth vs. grazing) if residuals indicate temperature-phase errors.
- Allow seasonal mixing (k_mix) if nutrient drawdown or winter recharge is systematically biased.
- Introduce a detrital pool if recycling appears unrealistically fast.

Action requested:
- Please provide the residuals file so we can confirm expected improvements and check for remaining patterns after this change.
