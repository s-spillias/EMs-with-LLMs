  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ model that retains the canonical roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, mixing; P growth, grazing losses, mortality; Z growth and mortality) but uses different functional forms and many additional ecological modifiers. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (seasonal forcing + Beer\u2013Lambert self-shading) and a Q10 temperature modifier, i.e. an alternate multiplicative nutrient \u00d7 light \u00d7 temperature growth formulation. Grazing is a generalized Holling form (P^h/(K_P^h+P^h)) which includes Holling-III as a special case (h=2). Recycling and remineralization are explicit (unassimilated grazing, mortality routing fractions), and mixing is present as a linear relaxation for nutrients. The candidate also includes extra processes not present in the TRUTH script (seasonal light and self-shading, Q10 temperature modifier, explicit yield/y_P, excretion term, quadratic mortality terms, and explicit mortality-to-nutrient routing fractions).",
