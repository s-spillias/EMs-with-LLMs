  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ processes in a standard, modular way: Monod (Michaelis\u2013Menten) nutrient limitation driving P growth, a saturating Holling-type grazing (with tunable exponent h), assimilation of grazing to Z, explicit linear+quadratic mortalities, and nutrient mixing (relaxation to external N). It departs from the TRUTH model mainly by splitting light and nutrient limitation (explicit seasonal light forcing LI and Q10 temperature modifier on rates) rather than the TRUTH's single combined term, and by adding several ecologically realistic extras (temperature/Q10, seasonal light forcing, temp-dependent assimilation, explicit excretion, yield/y_P, explicit recycling fractions, quadratic mortalities). Two process-level omissions/bugs relative to TRUTH are: (1) phytoplankton physical mixing term (there is no P_mix term analogous to TRUTH's -(s+k)*P) and (2) zooplankton excretion (Z_excr) is subtracted from Z but not routed into N_remin (so explicit excretion does not appear to return to nutrients). Overall the candidate matches TRUTH in functional families for most components (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling grazing, assimilation, mortalities) and otherwise implements plausible alternates and extensions.",
