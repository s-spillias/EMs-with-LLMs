Assessment and rationale for the proposed improvement

1) Model fit to data
- Quantitative assessment is pending the residuals file (not provided here). Please share it so we can compute summary statistics (bias, RMSE, autocorrelation of residuals) and identify state- and time-specific misfits.
- Qualitatively, the current parameterization suggests a likely structural scaling issue in zooplankton grazing: the literature-updated K_g = 5750 g C m^-3 (with tight bounds) is orders of magnitude larger than typical mixed-layer phytoplankton concentrations and known half-saturation values. This would suppress grazing across the full observed range, generally leading to P overprediction and Z underprediction, and potentially skewing N dynamics (e.g., excess drawdown or accumulation depending on P losses).

2) Alignment with project context
- The model captures key processes for an NPZ mixed-layer system: nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth with light and temperature modifiers, sigmoidal grazing by zooplankton with temperature scaling, linear and quadratic mortality/losses, and remineralization plus vertical mixing for N.
- Thus, the structure is broadly appropriate for the stated context. However, fidelity hinges on correctly scaled interaction strengths—especially grazing—because it regulates bloom formation, crash timing, and trophic transfer.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Grazing scale/units: The updated K_g value appears unit-mismatched, rendering grazing ineffective. This is the most pressing issue.
- Constant assimilation efficiency e_Z: In reality, e_Z varies with food quality/quantity and temperature; keeping it constant may limit fidelity but is secondary to fixing grazing scale.
- No detritus/DOC pool: Sloppy feeding and aggregation are lumped into quadratic mortality and direct remineralization; acceptable for simplicity but may miss time lags and export processes.
- Light limitation considers self-shading by P only; acceptable at this model order.
- Loss terms (mP1, mP2, mZ1, mZ2) are temperature invariant; could be refined later if residuals show temp-linked biases.

Chosen improvement: unit-aware scaling of K_g via a new parameter K_g_scale

Why this is the single most impactful change now
- The literature-constrained K_g = 5750 g C m^-3 implies extremely weak grazing at realistic P. This is likely the dominant source of systematic misfit (overly persistent or large P, weak Z response).
- Rather than altering the functional form, we introduce a dimensionless scaling K_g_scale so the model uses an effective K_g_eff = K_g * K_g_scale in the grazing response. This keeps the literature constraint on K_g intact while letting the model reconcile unit inconsistencies (e.g., mg L^-1 vs g m^-3, or misapplied 1000-fold conversions).

Mathematical change
- Original grazing term: G_fun = P^h / (K_g^h + P^h)
- Revised with unit scaling: let K_g_eff = K_g * K_g_scale, then
  G_fun = P^h / (K_g_eff^h + P^h)
- Only the effective half-saturation is altered; all other processes remain the same.

Parameterization
- New parameter: K_g_scale (dimensionless), initial value 0.001, bounds [1e-6, 1.0].
- Ecological justification: corrects for likely unit mismatch and allows the optimizer to adjust within a plausible range without enabling unbounded re-scaling.

Expected impact on dynamics and fit
- Stronger grazing at realistic P will temper phytoplankton blooms, increase trophic transfer to Z, and adjust remineralization pathways—likely improving timing and magnitude of P peaks and Z response, and stabilizing N dynamics.
- This change is minimal in complexity yet addresses a core interaction strength central to NPZ dynamics.

Next steps (after residuals are available)
- Verify that residuals show reduced bias in P and Z after re-fitting.
- If misfits persist, consider adding temperature modifiers to mP1/mZ1 or food-dependent e_Z as the next incremental refinement.
