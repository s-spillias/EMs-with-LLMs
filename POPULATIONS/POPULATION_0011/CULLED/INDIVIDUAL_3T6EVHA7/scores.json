  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ process model with all core compartments (N, P, Z) and the expected flows (uptake \u2192 P growth, grazing \u2192 Z growth, mortality \u2192 recycling, and nutrient mixing). However it uses different mathematical choices than the TRUTH model: nutrient uptake is a Hill/Monod-style term combined with an explicit light limitation (smooth Liebig min) and a stoichiometric yield, grazing is a Holling-like sigmoidal functional response with Beddington\u2013DeAngelis interference and an exponent, mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms, and temperature Q10 modifiers are applied to growth/grazing rates. Some TRUTH terms (explicit phytoplankton and zooplankton mixing/entrainment losses) are not present. Numerically the candidate uses an explicit Euler update with smooth positivity/regularization and soft parameter penalties (numerical choices not present in TRUTH).",

Type fN = Nh / (Kh + Nh + eps);\" and \"Type N_uptake  = P_growth / (y_PN + eps);\". This differs from TRUTH's (N/(e+N))*(a/(b+c*P))*P but is the common Monod/Hill family (alternate)."
