  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure and most canonical ecological processes from the TRUTH model, but with several generalized/alternate functional forms and extra bookkeeping. Nutrient uptake is Monod-like with a saturating self-shading term (structurally equivalent to the TRUTH uptake). Grazing and zooplankton growth are implemented as a generalized Holling-type functional response (flexible exponent, smooth prey-threshold and seasonal modulation) rather than the fixed Holling-III used in TRUTH. Recycling is explicitly partitioned into multiple routed fluxes (egestion, growth-inefficiency, mortality fractions) rather than the fewer aggregated terms in TRUTH. Mixing on nutrients is present and matches TRUTH; however, explicit mixing/physical loss for P and Z is not implemented in the candidate. The candidate also adds seasonal environmental modulation and an explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality term and smooth prey-refuge parameters that are not in the TRUTH NPZ.",
