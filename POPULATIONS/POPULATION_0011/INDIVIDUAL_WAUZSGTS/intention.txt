Assessment of current model and rationale for improvement

Summary of the current model
- State variables: Nutrient (N), Phytoplankton (P), Zooplankton (Z)
- Core processes:
  - P growth limited by nutrients and light with temperature scaling (Q10)
  - Z grazing on P with a sigmoidal (Type III-like) functional response and Beddington–DeAngelis (BD) predator interference
  - Linear and quadratic mortality terms for P and Z
  - Direct remineralization of P and Z losses to N, and non-assimilated ingestion routed immediately to N
  - Vertical mixing coupling surface N to a deep pool
- Observation model: Lognormal errors for N, P, Z
- Numerical safeguards: Soft-positivity for states, SD floors, soft penalties on parameter bounds

1) Fit to data
- The residuals file was not provided in this chat. Without the residuals, I cannot quantify fit (e.g., bias, variance, autocorrelation) or identify time periods/states with systematic mismatch.
- Please provide the residuals (or summary statistics of residuals by state and time) so I can confirm/quantify fit issues (e.g., under/over-shoot during blooms, poor low-biomass behavior, phase lags).
- Provisional expectations (based on structure alone):
  - Potential over-estimation of Z growth during severe nutrient limitation of P, because e_Z is constant and does not reflect poor prey quality.
  - Possible misfit during low-light/low-N periods because light is static (I0 is constant) and temperature is not time-varying.

2) Alignment with the project context
- The model is an NPZ mixed-layer model that explicitly represents N, P, Z, including:
  - Limitation of P by nutrient and light
  - Grazing with density dependence and interference
  - Recycling and vertical exchange
- This directly addresses “The dynamical behaviour of a simple plankton population model” in a mixed layer. It contains the core mechanisms expected for the stated context.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- Variable prey quality and zooplankton assimilation efficiency:
  - e_Z is constant, but zooplankton growth efficiency is known to decline when phytoplankton are nutrient-limited (e.g., due to stoichiometric mismatch and poor quality).
  - The model already tracks nutrient limitation of P via fN_sat and a smooth threshold fN_thr, so an efficiency modifier can be linked to these.
- Detritus/DOM pool:
  - Non-assimilated ingestion is routed directly to inorganic N, bypassing detrital pathways. While acceptable for a simple model, it may steepen/accelerate recycling relative to reality.
- Light and temperature variability:
  - I0 and T_C are constant parameters, not time-varying environmental drivers. If the data span strong seasonality, this can lead to systematic pattern errors.
- Self-shading only (no background attenuation):
  - Light attenuation has only a P-dependent term (k_Ishade*P). A background attenuation term could improve early-season light limitation and deep-mixed layer conditions.
- Two nutrient limitation gates:
  - Growth includes both a Monod-like saturation (fN_sat) and a smooth threshold term (fN_thr). This can be realistic (soft colimitation and gating), but may also be redundant in some datasets.

Updated/placeholder parameters and structural implications
- parameters.json indicates no fields flagged as updated_from_literature = true at present. One parameter (“K_g”) is marked as “source: updated from literature,” but the flag is false, so no structural change is directly implied by literature updates.
- No immediate need to change scaling/functional form from literature updates alone.

Chosen improvement: variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency linked to nutrient limitation
Ecological reasoning
- When phytoplankton are nutrient-poor, zooplankton convert less ingested carbon into biomass; more is excreted/egested and remineralized.
- Representing this as a simple, bounded function of nutrient status captures an important feedback:
  - Low N → lower fN_sat → lower effective e_Z → reduced Z growth, increased recycling to N.
  - This can reduce unrealistic Z peaks during nutrient-depleted periods and improve phase/amplitude dynamics of P and Z.

Mathematical formulation
- Introduce a new parameter η_e in [0, 1] that modulates how strongly assimilation efficiency depends on nutrient limitation:
  - e_Z_eff = e_Z * ((1 - η_e) + η_e * fN_sat)
  - Bounds: fN_sat ∈ [0,1], so e_Z_eff ∈ [e_Z(1 - η_e), e_Z].
  - Special cases:
    - η_e = 0: e_Z_eff = e_Z (status quo)
    - η_e = 1: e_Z_eff scales linearly with fN_sat
- Modify:
  - Z_growth = e_Z_eff * Z_grazing
  - N_remin includes (1 - e_Z_eff) * Z_grazing (replacing the constant e_Z term)
- No changes to the observation model or other processes are required.

Anticipated effects on dynamics and fit
- During nutrient limitation (low fN_sat), Z growth efficiency decreases, dampening Z biomass peaks and reducing pressure on P, which can better match observed P persistence.
- Increased non-assimilated ingestion when P is nutrient-poor will enhance recycling to N, potentially improving the recovery of N after blooms.
- Identifiability: η_e trades off with e_Z to a degree, but the shape of responses across nutrient regimes helps distinguish them. Bounds restrict η_e ∈ [0,1].

Next steps after implementing:
- Refit and inspect residuals by state:
  - Expect reduced positive residuals for Z during low-N periods (model previously overpredicting Z).
  - Check for improved P low-biomass persistence and more realistic N rebounds.
- If residuals remain seasonally structured, consider time-varying environmental drivers (I(t), T(t)) or adding a background light attenuation k_bg (not included in this change).

Implementation notes
- No data leakage introduced: e_Z_eff uses only previous-step state N via fN_sat(Np).
- All new terms are differentiable and retain positivity constraints.
- Added soft-bound penalty for η_e to [0, 1].

Additional implementation fixes (this update)
- Fixed an incomplete model.cpp that previously ended mid-declaration, causing compilation failure.
- Introduced explicit initial state parameters (N0, P0, Z0) to initialize the state trajectory without using observed values at t0, honoring the “no data leakage” requirement.
- Implemented a discrete-time Euler integration using only previous-step predicted states for process calculations.
- Applied smooth floors for observation SDs and soft penalties for basic biological bounds to improve numerical stability during estimation.
