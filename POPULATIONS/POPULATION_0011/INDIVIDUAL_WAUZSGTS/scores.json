  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a full NPZ model with the canonical flows (uptake \u2192 P growth, grazing \u2192 Z growth, recycling to N, and N mixing) but uses different functional forms for several processes. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use Monod-like uptake and an explicit light Monod with self-shading and a smooth nutrient gate (alternate to the TRUTH multiplicative fraction N/(e+N) and the TRUTH light term). Grazing is a flexible Holling-style (P^h/(K^h+P^h)) with a Beddington\u2013DeAngelis predator-interference denominator and variable assimilation efficiency; zooplankton growth is assimilation*Grazing (same ecological role as TRUTH but with different grazing and a nutrient-dependent e_Z). Mixing of nutrients into a deep pool is mathematically equivalent to the TRUTH mixing term. The candidate also introduces explicit temperature (Q10) scaling, predator-interference, a smooth nutrient-threshold gate, and nutrient-dependent assimilation efficiency which are not present in the TRUTH code.",
