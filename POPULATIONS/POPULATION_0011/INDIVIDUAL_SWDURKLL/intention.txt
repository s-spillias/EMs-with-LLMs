PROJECT: NPZ mixed-layer model (N, P, Z) with light, nutrients, grazing, mixing

Assessment summary
- Fit to data:
  - Residuals file was not provided here, so I cannot compute or reference actual residual structures. Please supply the residuals to refine this assessment.
  - Expected common patterns to check once residuals are available:
    - N: biased positive residuals during blooms if losses are too weak or growth too strong; negative residuals during stratified, warm periods if remin/mixing too strong.
    - P: phase errors (peaks too early/late), over-damped decay after bloom if losses do not respond to temperature; amplitude bias if grazing functional response mismatched.
    - Z: lag/phase mismatch relative to P, overly diffuse peaks if grazing is too linear at low P; underestimation if assimilation efficiency too low when nutrients are high.
- Model–context alignment:
  - The model is a biologically plausible NPZ with:
    - Co-limitation by light and nutrients (Monod for N; self-shading exponential for I; smooth nutrient threshold gate).
    - Grazing with Holling-like nonlinearity (h_exp) and Beddington–DeAngelis interference (c_BD).
    - Nutrient recycling from P and Z losses, plus non-assimilated grazing.
    - Vertical mixing relaxation to a deep nutrient pool (N_deep).
    - Temperature dependence via Q10 on growth and grazing.
    - Variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency modulated by nutrient status (eta_e).
  - This is appropriate for mixed-layer seasonal dynamics, avoiding data leakage by not using observations in process updates.
- Potentially missing or simplified processes:
  - Temperature dependence of loss processes: mP1 and mZ1 are constant in the original code, whereas loss/excretion and mortality are temperature sensitive. This can bias seasonal timing (especially warm vs. cold periods).
  - Photoinhibition at high light: not included; may matter for very high surface irradiance, but adds parameters and complexity.
  - Flexible stoichiometry (quota models) or variable yield y_PN: not included; more complex and data-demanding.
  - Detrital pool and delayed remineralization: currently instantaneous; may improve realism but increases state dimension.
  - Background (non-P) light attenuation or MLD effects: I0 and k_Ishade implicitly capture these but could be refined if MLD and optics are known.
  - Environmental modulation of mixing or remineralization: currently constant.

Parameter review highlights
- Many parameters are literature-based with plausible ranges.
- q10_mu and q10_g are included; losses lack Q10 scaling in the original version.
- K_g lists “updated from literature” in source, but the metadata flag updated_from_literature is false; this is a minor metadata inconsistency and does not affect dynamics.
- Bounds look reasonable; observation SD floors are enforced in-model.

Chosen improvement
- Approach: Environmental modifier of processes — add temperature dependence (Q10) to linear loss terms mP1 and mZ1.
- Ecological justification:
  - Phytoplankton lysis/excretion and zooplankton excretion/mortality are temperature sensitive. Scaling mP1 and mZ1 with Q10 captures seasonal acceleration of loss processes in warmer water, helping tune bloom decay and Z dynamics without adding new states.
  - This change is simpler than adding photoinhibition or quota dynamics, yet often delivers clear improvements in phase and amplitude fit.
- Mathematical formulation:
  - mP1_T = mP1 * q10_mP^((T_C - T_ref)/10)
  - mZ1_T = mZ1 * q10_mZ^((T_C - T_ref)/10)
  - Replace mP1 and mZ1 by these temperature-scaled versions in loss terms:
    - P_loss = mP1_T * P + mP2 * P^2
    - Z_loss = mZ1_T * Z + mZ2 * Z^2
  - All other structures unchanged; no data leakage introduced.
- Parameters added:
  - q10_mP: Q10 for phytoplankton linear loss. Initial 2.0; bounds [1.1, 3.0].
  - q10_mZ: Q10 for zooplankton linear loss. Initial 2.0; bounds [1.1, 3.0].

Expected effect on residuals (to verify when residuals are available)
- Reduced positive P residuals during warm periods post-bloom (faster decay via higher mP1_T).
- Improved timing and amplitude of Z peaks (mZ1_T adjusting turnover at higher T).
- Potentially improved N dynamics via tighter coupling of P and Z loss to N_remin.

Notes and next steps
- After inspecting residuals, consider:
  - If high-light negative P residuals appear, add a photoinhibition modifier to f_I.
  - If early-bloom grazing is too strong, increase h_exp or add a refuge taper; if too weak, reduce h_exp.
  - If nutrient stoichiometry signals (C:N shifts) are available, consider variable y_PN or quota dynamics, though this increases complexity.
