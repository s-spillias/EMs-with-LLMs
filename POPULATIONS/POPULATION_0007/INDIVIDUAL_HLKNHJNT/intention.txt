Project Assessment:
- The current model captures the overall boom-bust dynamics of COTS; however, the predation loss on coral is modeled in an overly linear fashion.
- This oversimplification may lead to unrealistic coral loss under high COTS densities.
- To address this, we incorporate a Holling type II functional response by introducing half-saturation constants for predation (k_half_fast for fast-growing coral and k_half_slow for slow-growing coral).
- This modification ensures that only historical (lagged) coral values drive predictions, thus avoiding data leakage and better reflecting ecological limitations.
