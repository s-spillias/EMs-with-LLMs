Model Intention Summary:
1. Model Purpose: Simulate episodic outbreaks of Crown‐of‐Thorns Starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef by capturing boom-bust cycles.
2. Ecological Functioning: The model incorporates saturating resource limitation, threshold effects, and process-specific efficiencies. Environmental forcing modulates intrinsic growth rates, and selective predation on coral communities (fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites) is explicitly modeled.
3. Mechanisms: Outbreaks are triggered when COTS exceed a density threshold, with subsequent rapid increases (boosted by environmental conditions) followed by decline due to resource depletion and predation effects.
4. Numerical Stability: Small constants are added to avoid division by zero and smooth transitions replace hard cutoffs. Parameter bounds are imposed via smooth penalty functions.
5. Likelihood: All observations are used with lognormal error distributions and fixed minimum standard deviations to handle data spanning multiple orders of magnitude.
