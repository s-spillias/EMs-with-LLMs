Assessment and rationale:

1) Fit to data
- Residuals: Not available in this context. Please provide the residuals file to quantify biases (timing, peak magnitude, duration) across COTS and coral series.
- Qualitative expectations from current structure:
  - Peaks: Can be achieved via superlinear recruitment (phi > 1), Allee effect, and immigration pulses.
  - Busts: Driven mainly by density-dependent mortality (gammaC*C^2) and prey depletion through the functional response.
  - Potential shortcoming: If busts are too mild or prolonged, adult mortality may be insufficiently responsive to prey scarcity.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT (episodic outbreaks)
- Strengths: Includes (i) superlinear recruitment with Allee threshold; (ii) resource-driven recruitment; (iii) temperature-driven recruitment; (iv) explicit fast/slow coral dynamics with selective predation; (v) outbreak termination via density dependence and coral depletion.
- Gaps: Key feedback for sharp busts is missing—elevated starvation mortality when coral cover is low. Outbreak onset is well represented; termination speed and depth may be underestimated.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Starvation/food-limited adult mortality (missing).
- Environmental drivers beyond SST (nutrients/river runoff) that affect larval survival (not in provided data).
- Time delays in stock–recruit (spawning to settlement) could be explored if mis-timing of peaks appears in residuals.
- Disturbance pulses (cyclones, culling) not represented; may be folded into immigration if data exist.

Chosen improvement: Add food-limited adult mortality
- Ecological reasoning: After corals are heavily consumed, adults experience resource scarcity, increasing mortality. This accelerates the bust and better reproduces observed rapid declines after peaks.
- Mathematical form: Use existing food saturation f_food = R/(K_R + R). Adult mortality:
  Mort_adult = [muC + gammaC*C + mu_food*(1 - f_food)] * C
  where mu_food >= 0 is the maximal additional mortality under food scarcity. This term is bounded, smooth, and uses only previous time-step states—no data leakage.
- Expected effect:
  - Little change during outbreak growth (high f_food).
  - Stronger, faster declines when coral is scarce (low f_food), improving peak duration and post-peak slopes.
  - Helps prevent unrealistic persistence at low prey availability.

Parameter updates:
- New parameter mu_food (yr^-1): initial value 0.6, bounds [0, 3], priority 1. Not literature-updated; to be estimated.
- Other parameters remain as-is. The literature-updated T_opt_bleach is compatible with current coral heat-stress structure.

Next steps:
- Please share the residuals file to verify improvements, especially:
  - Over-persistence of adult COTS after peaks (would support higher mu_food).
  - Mis-timed peaks (may suggest adding a recruitment lag next).
- If residuals indicate excessive peak heights, consider introducing recruitment overcompensation at very high adult densities; if peaks are too delayed, consider a 1–2 year recruitment lag.
