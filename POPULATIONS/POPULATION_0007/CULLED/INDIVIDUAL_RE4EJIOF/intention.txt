Model Assessment and Improvement:

Current observations:
- The model captures the boom-bust behavior of COTS populations using lagged predictors.
- Residuals indicate systematic deviations during outbreak phases, suggesting that the linear predation terms on coral cover may be oversimplified.

Improvement rationale:
- Introduce a saturating (Holling Type II) functional response for predation on corals.
- This modification limits the per-capita predation rate when COTS densities are high, reflecting ecological constraints (e.g., handling times and competition among starfish) during outbreaks.
- New half-saturation parameters (half_sat_cots_fast and half_sat_cots_slow) determine the COTS density at which predation is half-maximal.

This change should improve the match with observed data by providing a more realistic representation of coral losses during COTS outbreaks.
