Below is a summary of the changes I propose:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

 1 Assessment and Ecological Improvement (intention.txt):                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
   We found that while the model captures boom‐bust dynamics and uses lagged predictors appropriately, the current linear representation of predation losses on coral cover may exaggerate the effects under very high COTS densities. Residuals suggest systematic deviations during outbreak phases. To capture saturating predation (e.g., via a Holling Type II response), we      
   introduce half‐saturation constants so that at high starfish densities the per‐capita predation on coral levels off. This reflects ecological limits on feeding, prey handling, and competition among starfish.                                                                                                                                                                     
 2 New Parameters (parameters.json):                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
   Two new parameters—half_sat_cots_fast and half_sat_cots_slow—are added. These represent the COTS density at which predation pressure on fast-growing and slow-growing corals reaches half its maximum value, respectively. Their inclusion is justified by the need to limit predation rates during large outbreaks.                                                                
 3 Model Implementation (model.cpp):                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
   A new block is added in the parameter declarations to read the half-saturation constants. Furthermore, in the coral dynamics equations the predation terms are modified so that predation losses are now computed as:                                                                                                                                                               
   predation = efficiency × prey × starfish / (half_sat + starfish)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
   This ensures that only previous time step values are used and helps capture the saturating effects.

 Current observations:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 - The model captures the boom-bust behavior of COTS populations using lagged predictors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 - Residuals indicate systematic deviations during outbreak phases, suggesting that the linear predation terms on coral cover may be oversimplified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Improvement rationale:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 - Introduce a saturating (Holling Type II) functional response for predation on corals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 - This modification limits the per-capita predation rate when COTS densities are high, reflecting ecological constraints (e.g., handling times and competition among starfish) during outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                                                      
 - New half-saturation parameters (half_sat_cots_fast and half_sat_cots_slow) determine the COTS density at which predation is half-maximal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 This change should improve the match with observed data by providing a more realistic representation of coral losses during COTS outbreaks.
