Assessment relative to project context (NPZ dynamics)
- Fit to data: A residuals file was not provided in the current files, so I cannot quantify bias, variance, or autocorrelation of residuals. Please share residuals to enable a formal assessment (e.g., by component, over time, and against covariates).
- Context alignment: The current model simulates Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) and coral dynamics, not an explicit NPZ system. However, COTS larval survival/recruitment can be bottom-up limited by planktonic food, creating a mechanistic linkage to NPZ variability.
- Missing processes: Explicit NPZ compartments (N, P, Z), zooplankton grazing, and phytoplankton nutrient uptake are absent.

Parameter review
- Several parameters have literature-sourced values (T_opt_rec, T_opt_bleach, rF, rS, qF, qS). These do not force structural changes by themselves.
- K_food remains defined to support a resource-limitation mechanism using an exogenous food proxy (e.g., phytoplankton concentration). The code’s soft-penalty range (0.001–1000) accommodates varied units.

Chosen ecological improvement and current implementation status
- Intended improvement: Resource limitation on COTS recruitment via a Monod saturating function f_food = food / (K_food + food), using an exogenous driver food_dat at t-1 (no data leakage).
- Current implementation: To resolve a runtime error due to missing food_dat in the provided dataset, the model now applies a neutral fallback for food limitation: f_food = 1.0. This keeps the model operational without the external driver. If food_dat becomes available, we can re-enable explicit food limitation by reinstating the data vector and f_food calculation.

Mathematical/structural notes
- Recruitment (current): Rec_t = α_rec * [C_{t-1}^φ / (1 + C_{t-1}/C_sat_rec)] * f_Allee(C_{t-1}) * f_Trec(SST_{t-1}) * 1.0 + cotsimm_{t-1}
- Neutral food effect: f_food = 1.0 ensures no dependence on a missing driver, avoiding data ingestion errors. Time indexing continues to use t-1 inputs, preventing data leakage.

Expected effects on inference and fit (pending residuals)
- With neutral food effect, dynamics reflect temperature and stock-dependence without bottom-up modulation by food. If residuals show phase/amplitude biases correlated with independent food proxies, reintroducing f_food should help.

Next steps (optional)
- Provide food_dat (e.g., chlorophyll-a or modeled phytoplankton) aligned with Year. Once available, re-enable f_food to capture bottom-up forcing.
- After reactivation, consider a generalized Monod with a Hill exponent if low-food sensitivity is mis-specified.
