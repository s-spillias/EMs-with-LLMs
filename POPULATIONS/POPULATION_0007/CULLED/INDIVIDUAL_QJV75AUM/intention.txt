Assessment and Improvement:
The current model captures key processes such as COTS growth dynamics, mortality, and coral predation. However, residuals suggest that the recovery rates of coral communities are not well represented, likely because the model uses constant recovery rates independent of environmental conditions. 

To address this, we introduce an environmental stress modifier on coral recovery rates. Specifically, coral recovery is reduced when sea surface temperatures deviate from an optimal value (e.g., ~27Â°C) due to thermal stress. This approach captures an ecologically realistic feedback mechanism that influences the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
