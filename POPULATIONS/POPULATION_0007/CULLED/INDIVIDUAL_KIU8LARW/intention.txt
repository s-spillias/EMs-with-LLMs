Assessment:
The current model uses a purely exponential growth formulation for COTS, which tends to over-predict population increases during outbreak events. Residual analysis indicates systematic errors at outbreak peaks. To more accurately capture the boom‐bust cycles of COTS, we introduce a logistic growth term via a new carrying capacity parameter. This added mechanism represents resource limitations, thereby capping growth at high densities and providing a self‐limiting effect. This change is ecologically justified as resource competition and habitat limitations are key factors in coral reef systems.
