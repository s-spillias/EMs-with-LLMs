Assessment:
The current model adequately represents several key ecological processes, such as density‐dependent competition and environmental triggers. However, it does not include a feedback mechanism to capture how the availability of coral prey constrains COTS growth. In reality, when coral cover is low, food limitations can curb further COTS population expansion, contributing to the boom‐bust dynamics observed during outbreaks.
To address this, we introduce a resource limitation mechanism by modulating the growth term with a factor based on the sum of fast and slow coral cover (scaled by their maximum potential of 200%). A new parameter, "resource_lim_coef", allows us to adjust the non‐linearity of this effect. Values greater than 1 strengthen the resource limitation at lower coral cover levels. This improvement is expected to better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
