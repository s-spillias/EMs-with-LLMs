Assessment and rationale for change

1) Model fit to data
- No residuals file was provided, so I could not quantitatively assess fit. Based on structure, the model likely:
  - Over-predicts persistence at low COTS densities (per-capita reproduction remains linear in N with only high-density limitation).
  - May mistime outbreak onsets and decay phases because there is no low-density threshold for successful spawning and fertilization.
  - Could under-represent outbreak amplitude and duration variability if recruitment is too smoothly tied to prey and temperature.

2) Alignment with the PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths:
  - Selective predation on fast vs slow corals via preference and Type III functional responses.
  - Coral competition and carrying capacities with space limitation.
  - Temperature-driven bleaching mortality.
  - COTS reproduction modulated by prey (feed_level) and temperature, plus density limitation at high N.
- Gaps relative to episodic outbreaks:
  - No mate-finding Allee effect for a broadcast spawner, which can generate threshold dynamics essential for boom-bust cycles.
  - Immigration is exogenous and lacks coupling to environmental pulses (e.g., runoff/phytoplankton) or lagged upstream densities.
  - No stage structure or juvenile refuge, which can shape outbreak duration and decay.
  - Conversion efficiency is static (not environment- or prey-state-modulated).

3) Parameter review and ecological consistency
- log_m0 is tightly constrained near ~0.9465 (m0≈2.58 yr^-1), implying high baseline adult mortality; this increases the need for realistic constraints on reproduction.
- log_r_f is tightly constrained at −2.9957 (r_f≈0.05 yr^-1), i.e., very slow intrinsic regrowth of fast corals; together with predation this supports bust phases but demands a realistic trigger for booms.
- With only a high-density limitation (K_cots) in reproduction, the model has no mechanism to suppress reproduction at low N, which can lead to spurious persistence and premature rebounds.

Chosen improvement: Allee effect in COTS reproduction
- Ecological basis: COTS are broadcast spawners; fertilization success increases nonlinearly with adult density and aggregation, producing mate limitation at low densities and threshold behavior during recovery. This is a well-documented mechanism for echinoderms and aligns with observed outbreak thresholds on the GBR.
- Mathematical representation:
  - Added a mating success multiplier: mate_success = N^h / (N^h + N_crit^h), with h≥1.
  - Updated births: dN_birth = epsN*b_max*temp_mult*feed_level*dens_mod*mate_success*N.
  - This preserves the original food and temperature modifiers and the high-density limitation, while adding low-density depensation necessary for realistic boom-bust dynamics.
- Parameters added:
  - log_N_crit: log-scale Allee threshold density (ind/m^2) where mating success is 50%. Suggested soft biological range 0.005–0.5 ind/m^2; initialization at log(0.05).
  - log_h_allee_plus: log(h−1) ensures h≥1; controls steepness of the threshold. Initialization at 0 implies h=2 (moderate threshold) if optimized upward; bounds allow flexibility.
- Implementation notes:
  - No data leakage: only previous time-step states and exogenous drivers are used for transitions.
  - Added a soft bound penalty on N_crit to encourage plausible adult densities for fertilization thresholds.

Expected impacts
- Better timing of outbreak initiation (requires surpassing N_crit).
- More realistic amplitude and duration of outbreaks due to stronger nonlinearity in recruitment.
- Reduced spurious persistence at low densities, improving bust phases.

Next steps (pending residuals)
- If residuals show systematic underprediction of peak magnitude despite Allee improvement, consider:
  - Environmental pulse on immigration (e.g., runoff/chl-a with a 1–2 year lag).
  - Temperature-dependent conversion efficiency or stage-structured survival.
- If residuals show delayed decay, re-evaluate density-dependent mortality mD or allow a bleaching–predation interaction term.
