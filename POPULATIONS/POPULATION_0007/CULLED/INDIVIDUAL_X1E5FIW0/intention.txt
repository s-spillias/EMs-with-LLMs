Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
The current model simulates COTS outbreaks using exponential growth modulated by an environmental trigger. However, it omits a key density-dependent mechanism that can curb excessive growth, which is important for capturing realistic boomâ€“bust cycles. This refactor introduces a logistic regulation term by adding a carrying capacity (log_cots_cap). Ecologically, as COTS populations increase, resource limitation and intraspecific competition should slow further expansion, naturally accounting for the observed outbreak termination. This improvement is expected to better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef.
