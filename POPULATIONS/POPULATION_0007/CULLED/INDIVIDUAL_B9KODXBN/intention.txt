Assessment: The current model uses a linear environmental trigger based on sea surface temperature (SST) and larval immigration, which may be too simplistic to capture the rapid and extreme outbreak dynamics observed in COTS populations. Residual analysis indicates that higher SST values could be driving non-linear effects not captured by the linear term.
Chosen Improvement: We introduce a quadratic term for SST in the environmental trigger. This non-linear modification accounts for the possibility that extreme temperature conditions amplify outbreak initiation beyond a simple linear response. The new parameter, sst_poly_effect, scales this quadratic contribution.
