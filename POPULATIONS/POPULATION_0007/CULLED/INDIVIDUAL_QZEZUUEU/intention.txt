After evaluating residuals, the model tends to underpredict outbreak magnitudes when larval immigration is high because the current linear response overestimates recruitment at high larval inputs. To address this, I have introduced the parameter "trigger_sat" to implement a saturating effect on larval immigration. The new trigger function is:

    trigger = 1.0 + 0.1 * sst_dat[t-1] + 0.05 * (cotsimm_dat[t-1] / (trigger_sat + cotsimm_dat[t-1]));

This modification is ecologically justified by the known limitations on larval settlement and the increased mortality at high larval densities.
