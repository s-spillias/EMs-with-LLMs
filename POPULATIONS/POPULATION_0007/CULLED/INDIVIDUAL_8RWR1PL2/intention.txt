Assessment and Improvement:
The current model provides a reasonable representation of COTS dynamics using logistic growth and a Type II (saturating) coral predation term. However, Type II may oversimplify the predation response at low coral cover, potentially underestimating the delay in predation that allows rapid COTS population outbreaks. To better capture the episodic, boom-bust cycles of COTS outbreaks, we implement a Holling Type III functional response. This modification uses a sigmoidal (non-linear) response where predation efficiency is low when coral cover is scarce (due to squared terms) and increases more rapidly with increasing coral. This change is ecologically justified as it allows for a more realistic representation of the delay in predation at low prey density while maintaining parameter parsimony.
