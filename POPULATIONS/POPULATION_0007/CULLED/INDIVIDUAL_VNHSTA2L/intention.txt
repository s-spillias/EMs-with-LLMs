Assessment:
The current model uses a quadratic term for SST (sst_quad_coef) to modify outbreak triggering. However, ecological theory and residual analysis suggest that outbreak initiation is more likely to occur once SST exceeds a critical threshold rather than varying smoothly in a quadratic fashion. 

Improvement:
We replace the quadratic SST effect with a logistic function that uses a threshold (sst_thresh) and a slope (sst_trigger_slope). This captures an abrupt transition in outbreak likelihood once a critical temperature is exceeded while maintaining baseline dynamics at lower temperatures.

This change is ecologically justified as SST thresholds are known to drive mass spawning and population shifts in marine systems.
