Assessment:
The current model implements logistic growth for COTS and uses a linear trigger function based on SST and larval immigration. However, this linear representation may overly smooth outbreak dynamics and fail to capture rapid, nonlinear escalation observed in empirical data. To improve ecological realism, I propose adding a quadratic SST term to the trigger multiplier. This change is justified by documented threshold responses in outbreak initiation, allowing the model to better simulate boom‚Äêbust cycles while avoiding data leakage by only utilizing t-1 values.
