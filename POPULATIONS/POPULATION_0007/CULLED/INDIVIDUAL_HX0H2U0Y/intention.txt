Assessment of current model relative to PROJECT CONTEXT (NPZ dynamics):
- Fit to data: The residuals file was not provided here, so a quantitative residual analysis could not be reproduced. Structurally, the observation models (lognormal for COTS abundance and logit-normal for coral cover) are appropriate.
- Alignment with NPZ context: The model addresses COTS–coral dynamics and includes an NPZ-consistent resource limitation pathway on COTS recruitment. This is represented via a food-limitation term that depends on a log-scale AR(1) food index driven by SST anomalies (bottom-up control).
- Missing or oversimplified processes: Direct N–P–Z state variables are not modelled; instead, a single resource index summarizes environmental control on larval survival. Immigration remains exogenous. Coral thermal stress is represented via bleaching modifiers.

Parameter review:
- Many parameters have weak range penalties that match broad ecological priors. Literature-based values (e.g., T_opt_bleach) are retained.
- Food limitation parameters (K_food, p_food) are active and identifiable with the environmental driver.
- The previously proposed latent random-effect vector for log-food required a parameter vector (logFood) to be provided at load time. This was not present in the parameters configuration, causing runtime failure in the model phases. To remove this dependency while retaining ecological realism, the log-food index is now computed deterministically from SST anomalies using (mu_logFood, rho_food, beta_sst_food). Consequently, the process SD (sigma_food) was removed because we are not estimating process noise for the latent state in this configuration.

Chosen single ecological improvement (retained with an implementation adjustment):
Resource limitation mechanism with environmental modifier:
- Implement a deterministic AR(1) log-food index driven by SST anomalies:
    logFood_t = mu_logFood + rho_food * (logFood_{t-1} - mu_logFood) + beta_sst_food * (SST_{t-1} - mean(SST))
  This preserves the intended NPZ-consistent bottom-up pathway without requiring a vector parameter.

Rationale:
- Captures key environmental control on recruitment timing/magnitude (bottom-up NPZ pathway) using available SST.
- Avoids the need to pass a PARAMETER_VECTOR of unknown length from the parameter file, which caused the earlier failure.
- Parsimonious and robust: reduces overfitting risk associated with an unconstrained random effect while still allowing persistent interannual variability via rho_food and sensitivity to SST via beta_sst_food.

Mathematical changes (implemented):
- Removed PARAMETER_VECTOR(logFood) and the AR(1) likelihood block. No process noise term is estimated.
- Internal deterministic recursion computes logFood_t from mu_logFood, rho_food, beta_sst_food and SST anomalies (using t−1 to prevent leakage).
- Food limitation on recruitment:
    Food_t = exp(logFood_t)
    f_food_t = (Food_{t-1} / (K_food + Food_{t-1}))^{p_food}
  Recruitment:
    Rec_t = alpha_rec * stock(C_{t-1}) * f_Allee(C_{t-1}) * f_Trec(SST_{t-1}) * f_food_t + cotsimm_{t-1}
- All prediction equations use previous time-step values of drivers and states, avoiding data leakage.

Parameters added/removed/updated:
- Retained: mu_logFood [-10, 10], rho_food [-0.99, 0.99], beta_sst_food [-5, 5] with ecological justifications (long-term mean, persistence, SST linkage).
- Removed: sigma_food (process SD) because the latent state is now deterministic; including it without a random-effect state would be inappropriate.

Expected impact on fit and residuals:
- Should reduce systematic recruitment misfit by matching boom/bust timing to environmental conditions (through SST anomalies).
- If future evidence supports substantial stochasticity in the food environment, the latent state can be reintroduced as a random effect with a parameter-vector entry added to the parameter configuration (so the loader has initial values and length T).

Reporting:
- food_index = exp(logFood_state) is reported for diagnostics.
- No response-variable current time steps are used in prediction equations; all drivers are from t−1 (no data leakage).
