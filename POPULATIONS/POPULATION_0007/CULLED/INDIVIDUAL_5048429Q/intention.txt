This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef. It captures the characteristic boom-bust cycles of COTS populations alongside their selective predation on coral communities (fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae spp. and Porities spp.). Environmental triggers (e.g., sea surface temperature and larval immigration rates) drive outbreak events, while saturating resource limitations, threshold effects, and feedback loops regulate both outbreak magnitude and coral recovery. The model uses smooth transitions and minimal constants for numerical stability, ensuring robust ecological predictions.
