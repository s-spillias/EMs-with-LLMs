This TMB model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef.
It captures boom-bust dynamics where COTS populations rapidly increase to outbreak levels due to favorable 
environmental conditions and resource availability, then decline as selective predation on fast-growing 
(Acropora spp.) and slow-growing (Faviidae spp. and Porites spp.) corals helps restore balance.
Key ecological mechanisms include saturating growth functions, threshold effects, indirect feedback loops, 
and environmental modifiers that trigger and sustain outbreak events.
