Assessment:
The current model uses a basic linear environmental trigger (1 + 0.1*sst_dat + 0.05*cotsimm_dat) to modulate the COTS growth rate. While this suffices for gradual changes, it may not capture the abrupt shifts observed in outbreak dynamics.
Improvement:
We propose replacing the linear trigger with an exponential function (exp(0.1*sst_dat + 0.05*cotsimm_dat)). This form better captures the threshold-like response where small changes in environmental conditions trigger a rapid, exponential outbreak of COTS.
Ecological Justification:
Environmental factors such as elevated sea surface temperature and larval immigration may interact non-linearly to trigger sudden population explosions. The exponential function allows for synergistic effects that can better represent these rapid outbreak events.
