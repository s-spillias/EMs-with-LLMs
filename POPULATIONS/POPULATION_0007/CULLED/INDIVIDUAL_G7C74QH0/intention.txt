Assessment:
The current model includes environmental triggers and density‐dependent effects, but the linear predation term does not account for predator saturation. In nature, predators often experience a saturating functional response (Michaelis–Menten kinetics) when prey is abundant, due to handling time and satiation. This can help to realistically capture the boom‐bust cycles observed in COTS outbreaks.

Improvement:
A saturating functional response has been introduced in the coral predation dynamics via two new parameters, log_half_sat_fast and log_half_sat_slow. These parameters represent the coral cover levels at which predation efficiency on fast- and slow-growing coral reaches half its maximum, adding ecologically justified nonlinearity to better depict predation dynamics.
