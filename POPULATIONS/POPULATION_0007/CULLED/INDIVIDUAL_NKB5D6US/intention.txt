Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
--------------------------------------
Residuals indicate the model struggles to match the timing and magnitude of outbreak cycles. 
Ecologically, COTS reproduction is strongly limited by available coral prey. The current model 
uses only an environmental trigger and density-dependent self-limitation (competition) but omits 
a direct resource limitation effect from coral cover.

Improvement:
------------
A new saturating resource limitation is introduced by adding a parameter 'half_sat_coral'. 
This parameter modulates the effective COTS reproduction rate based on the combined coral cover 
(fast-growing and slow-growing) from the previous time step. When coral cover is high, resource 
limitation is minimal (the saturating factor approaches 1), whereas when coral cover is low, 
the reproduction rate is reduced. This mechanism helps capture the boom-bust cycles observed 
in the Great Barrier Reef COTS outbreaks.

Ecological Justification:
-------------------------
COTS reproduction is inherently tied to the availability of coral prey. Including this resource 
limitation mechanism provides a more realistic representation of the predator-prey dynamics and 
helps prevent unrealistically high reproduction rates when prey becomes scarce.
