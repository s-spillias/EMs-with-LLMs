Intention:
This model simulates episodic outbreaks of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of boom-bust cycles. It models logistic growth with outbreak triggers (using a smooth threshold function) and environmental modulation (via sea-surface temperature effects) on COTS dynamics. The model further incorporates the impact of COTS predation on coral communities—differentiating between fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp.—using saturating functional responses. All predictions use only previous time step values to prevent data leakage, and the likelihood is computed via lognormal error distributions with small constants to ensure numerical stability.
