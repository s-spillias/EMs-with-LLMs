Assessment and Improvement:
The current model captures key processes such as growth, mortality, and competition but lacks an explicit resource limitation mechanism for COTS growth. Predation and recovery on coral are modeled separately, yet the feedback from coral availability on COTS proliferation is oversimplified. 
We introduce a new parameter, `half_sat_coral`, to model the saturation of COTS growth with respect to coral cover. The effective growth rate is now modulated by the saturating term (coral_resource/(half_sat_coral + coral_resource)), where coral_resource is the sum of the previous time stepâ€™s fast- and slow-growing coral cover. This change better captures boom-bust cycles by limiting outbreaks when coral resources are depleted.
