Temporary compatibility note (dataset mismatch)

- The current dataset provides columns: Year, cots_dat, fast_dat, slow_dat, sst_dat, cotsimm_dat, but does not include NPZ variables (N_dat, P_dat, Z_dat). The previous model version expected N_dat/P_dat/Z_dat and failed at data read time.
- To restore functionality and avoid data leakage while the NPZ data are unavailable, the NPZ observational block has been temporarily disabled in model.cpp. The model now only includes prediction vectors and likelihoods for cots_dat, slow_dat, and fast_dat using leak-free persistence dynamics:
  - x_pred(t) = max(0, x_pred(t-1)), initialized at t=0 from the corresponding observation.
- All NPZ-related parameters remain declared (and weakly range-penalized) to stay compatible with parameters.json and phase setup; they are not used in the current likelihood until NPZ data columns are provided.

Assessment and alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT (NPZ plankton model)

1) Model fit to data
- No residuals file was provided, and NPZ observations are currently absent from the dataset. Consequently, a quantitative fit assessment for N, P, Z cannot be performed at this time.
- The placeholder components for cots/slow/fast are decoupled from the NPZ context and exist solely to satisfy interface requirements without introducing data leakage.

2) Relevance to PROJECT CONTEXT
- The intended context is an NPZ mixed-layer model. The temporary change above is purely to maintain workflow compatibility. Once N_dat, P_dat, and Z_dat are available, the NPZ process equations and likelihood should be re-enabled to address the project goals directly.

3) Missing or oversimplified ecological processes
- The resource-limited primary production and trophic coupling (NPZ) previously described remain the recommended structure. At present, with NPZ data absent, only placeholder persistence for the available series is active.

Chosen ecological improvement: Resource limitation via saturating nutrient uptake (Monod) [planned when NPZ data are available]
- Approach category: Resource limitation mechanisms.
- Rationale: Phytoplankton growth in the mixed layer is constrained by dissolved nutrients. Monod limitation f(N) = N/(K_N + N) adds realism with minimal complexity.
- Future extensions (conditional on residuals and data availability): temperature modifiers (Q10/Arrhenius), variable assimilation efficiency, explicit detritus pool, light limitation.

Notes on data usage and leakage
- The active components use only lagged predicted states in process equations. Initialization uses the first observation at t=0. No current time-step observations are used inside process updates.

Next steps
- Provide NPZ data columns (N_dat, P_dat, Z_dat). Re-enable the NPZ dynamics and likelihood to evaluate fit and refine parameters within ecologically realistic bounds.
- After NPZ residuals are available, examine patterns to decide whether to add temperature/light modifiers or additional compartments.

Summary
- The compile failure was due to missing NPZ data columns. The model is adjusted to run with the currently available dataset using leak-free persistence for cots/slow/fast, while retaining NPZ parameters for future reinstatement of the full NPZ model once appropriate data are supplied.
