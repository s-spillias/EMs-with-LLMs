ASSESSMENT

1) Fit to data (residuals)
- Residuals file was not provided in this chat; the following assessment focuses on structural adequacy and expected residual patterns.
- Given the current structure, typical issues that often show up are:
  - Timing mismatches in outbreak onset if recruitment pulses are not sufficiently state- and environment-modulated.
  - Overly persistent adult densities if internal (juvenile-stage) negative feedback is weak.
  - Coral cover predictions drifting high if consumption and bleaching do not adequately constrain regrowth, or drifting low if predation parameters are too strong.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- The model includes key features needed for episodic boom–bust cycles:
  - Adult density-dependent mortality (muC + gammaC*C)
  - Recruitment driven by adult density with an Allee effect and temperature dependence
  - Resource dependence of recruitment via a coral resource index
  - A juvenile pool introducing a biologically realistic delay to outbreaks
  - Multi-prey functional response on corals and bleaching impacts on coral growth
- Missing feedback: a strong internal negative feedback at the juvenile stage (documented in COTS ecology through density-dependent early survival, predation on small juveniles, limited shelter, and possible cannibalism). This mechanism is important to sharpen boom-bust dynamics and improve timing and duration of outbreaks.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Juvenile density dependence: Not explicitly modeled; leads to overly persistent juvenile pools and can smooth outbreaks unrealistically.
- Environmental drivers beyond SST for recruitment (e.g., nutrient/runoff pulses) are represented only via exogenous immigration cotsimm_dat; acceptable if such data are provided, but otherwise outbreaks may be mis-timed if recruitment pulses are environmental in origin.
- Adult effects on early stages (intercohort competition or cannibalism) are absent; these help terminate outbreaks.

REVIEW OF CURRENT PARAMETERS
- T_opt_bleach updated_from_literature with narrowed bounds; current bleaching effect enters as a smooth exponential multiplier on coral growth plus linear additional loss per °C. Structure is still appropriate.
- Attack/efficiency parameters (aF > aS, qF > qS) reflect stronger preference/impact on fast-growing corals; consistent with ecological knowledge.
- rF > rS, K_tot < 100% are reasonable for reef coral cover constraints.
- Juvenile parameters mJ and muJ are present, but without density dependence they may not generate sufficiently episodic behavior on their own across sites/years.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT

Add density-dependent juvenile survival with an indirect adult feedback:
- Mechanism: Early-stage crowding and predation produce a Beverton-Holt-like saturation of juvenile survival, with crowding contributed by both juveniles and adults.
- Mathematical form (per year, using only previous states):
  J_survive = ((1 - mJ - muJ) * J_prev) / (1 + betaJ * (J_prev + thetaJ * C_prev))
  J_t = J_survive + Rec_in
  C_t = C_prev + mJ*J_prev - (muC + gammaC*C_prev)*C_prev
- Parameters:
  - betaJ (m^2 ind^-1): strength of juvenile crowding; suggested bounds [0, 10]
  - thetaJ (dimensionless): relative contribution of adults to juvenile crowding; suggested bounds [0, 5]
- Expected effects on fit and dynamics:
  - Sharper, more episodic outbreaks (faster collapse once densities get high).
  - Reduced residual autocorrelation in adult abundance during bust phases.
  - Improved timing when recovery from busts depends on both immigration and relaxation of crowding.

NOTES ON IDENTIFIABILITY AND INTERACTIONS
- betaJ will trade off with muJ and mJ; bounds and weak penalties (as implemented) help stabilize estimation.
- thetaJ helps separate pure juvenile self-crowding from adult-mediated feedback, improving interpretability.
- Recommendation when residuals become available: check for overdispersion during peaks and examine whether betaJ > 0 is supported; also review posterior correlations among {betaJ, muJ, mJ}.
