Assessment:

The current model uses a linear combination of sea surface temperature (SST) and larval immigration to create an environmental trigger that modulates COTS growth in a logistic framework. Although this captures basic boom-bust cycles, it does not fully represent the non-linear temperature effects that can drive sudden outbreak events during extreme conditions.

Improvement:

We introduce an "outbreak sensitivity" modifier that applies a saturating non-linear effect of temperature. Mathematically, we add a term of the form:
    outbreak_sensitivity * (sst^2 / (1.0 + sst^2))
to the trigger calculation. This additional term amplifies the effective growth rate when SST reaches high values, reflecting ecological thresholds and feedback mechanisms that are known to underlie episodic outbreak events. All predictions continue to use only previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
