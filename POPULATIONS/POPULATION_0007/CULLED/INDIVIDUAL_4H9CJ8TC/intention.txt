Purpose: Predict episodic Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS; Acanthaster cf. solaris) outbreaks and their impacts on coral cover (fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites) on the Great Barrier Reef, emphasizing timing, magnitude, and duration of boom-bust cycles.

Ecological functioning:
- Trophic coupling and feedbacks: COTS population growth depends on food (live coral cover) through a saturating food-limitation function. Coral is reduced by COTS feeding via a multi-prey Holling functional response with preference toward fast-growing Acropora. This creates positive feedbacks that can trigger outbreaks (high coral → high COTS growth) and subsequent busts (coral depletion → food-limited COTS decline).
- Environmental modulation: Sea-surface temperature (SST) modulates COTS reproductive success via a smooth, peaked temperature response and an additional outbreak amplifier that smoothly increases recruitment above a temperature threshold. Coral growth is also temperature-modulated around taxon-specific optima.
- Multiple limitation pathways: COTS dynamics include food-dependent recruitment efficiency and additional mortality under food scarcity. Coral growth is limited by space (shared carrying capacity) and predation pressure. Feeding is saturating with respect to prey availability and shares consumption between coral groups via preference-weighted availability.
- Forcing and immigration: Exogenous larval immigration contributes to COTS numbers; SST modifies both predator (COTS) reproduction and coral growth.
- Smoothness and stability: All transitions are smooth (no hard thresholds). Small constants prevent division by zero, and soft penalties discourage biologically implausible states without hard constraints.

Data-model linkage:
- State variables predicted annually from initial observed states: cots_pred (ind/m2), fast_pred (% cover), slow_pred (% cover).
- Forcings: sst_dat (°C), cotsimm_dat (ind/m2/yr).
- Observation model: Lognormal likelihoods with minimum standard deviations to handle wide dynamic range and small values.
