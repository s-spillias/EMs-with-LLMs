Assessment and Improvement Rationale:
Based on analysis of the residuals and model performance, the current formulation underestimates the decline phase following COTS outbreaks. This is likely due to an oversimplification of population regulation mechanisms. To better capture the boom-bust dynamics observed in the field, we have incorporated a density-dependent competition term into the COTS dynamics. This term (competition * cots_predÂ²) simulates the effect of intensified intraspecific competition or cannibalism at high population densities, ultimately contributing to the crash following outbreak events. The new parameter, log_competition, enables calibration of this effect against ecological data.
