Assessment:
- The model fits the outbreak data reasonably well overall, yet it tends to overpredict outbreak intensities when coral cover is low.
- One key oversimplification is that COTS growth is driven solely by an environmental trigger without explicit resource (coral availability) limitation.
- To better capture the boom-bust cycles and the selective predation on coral, we incorporate a resource limitation mechanism. A new parameter, "log_coral_dependency", is introduced to modulate the effective intrinsic growth rate of COTS based on the combined cover of fast- and slow-growing corals.
- Ecologically, this represents the half-saturation constant for coral dependency, ensuring that when coral availability is low, COTS growth is suppressed, thereby improving the accuracy in timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.
