Assessment and Improvement:
The current model effectively captures the basic boom-bust dynamics of COTS populations through logistic growth, environmental triggers, and predation on coral communities. However, the linear formulation of the SST effect in the environmental trigger may oversimplify the impact of high temperatures on outbreak onset. High SST values are likely to produce threshold effects â€“ small increases in SST produce little change until a critical point is reached when outbreaks are triggered rapidly. 

To improve ecological realism, we have introduced a quadratic term in the environmental trigger function. The new parameter (sst_quad) allows the model to nonlinearly amplify the impact of elevated SST, better capturing the abrupt onset of outbreak events. This enhancement is consistent with ecological observations of rapid and severe outbreak conditions.
