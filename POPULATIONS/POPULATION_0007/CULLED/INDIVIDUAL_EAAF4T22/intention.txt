ASSESSMENT AND RATIONALE

1) Model fit to data
- Note: A residuals file was referenced but not provided in this context. The assessment below is therefore based on model structure and typical COTS dynamics. Please share the residuals to validate/adjust these conclusions.
- Expected residual patterns with current structure:
  - Adult COTS: Potential over-prediction or overly persistent high densities after peaks because recruitment scales superlinearly with adults (C^phi, phi > 1) but has no high-density taper other than adult mortality. This can prolong outbreaks.
  - Coral covers: During outbreaks, fast coral (Acropora) declines should be sharp and slow coral declines flatter. The current multi-prey functional response can capture this, but if consumption saturates too weakly (small h, large aF, etaF > 1), residuals may show under-prediction of the speed/magnitude of fast coral loss at very low cover (Type-III softens feeding too much at low F).
  - Timing: Without a strong cap on recruitment at high adult density, peaks can arrive too quickly and last too long.

2) Alignment with PROJECT CONTEXT
- Strengths:
  - Outbreak initiation: Allee effect + superlinear fecundity (phi > 1) allows fast take-off once adults exceed a threshold, consistent with episodic outbreaks.
  - Boom-bust driver: Density-dependent mortality (gammaC) and coral resource consumption feedbacks produce declines following peaks.
  - Environmental modifiers: Recruitment has an SST Gaussian optimum; coral growth and bleaching include an SST threshold response.
- Gaps:
  - Recruitment scaling lacks high-density taper. Real systems show fertilization saturation, egg/larval survival bottlenecks, and post-settlement limits that cap recruitment at high spawner densities.
  - The resource term in recruitment (based on coral cover) is an oversimplification of larval ecology (larvae depend on plankton/nutrients rather than coral cover). While it may be a proxy for habitat/settlement or local conditions, it risks coupling recruitment to adult food in a way that can sustain unrealistically long outbreaks.

3) Missing or oversimplified processes
- Stock–recruitment saturation: Missing. Without it, C^phi with phi > 1 can create unrealistically persistent peaks.
- Exogenous recruitment pulses (nutrients/runoff): Partially represented via cotsimm_dat as an additive term; however, the structural lack of taper in the endogenous stock-recruitment relationship is the more pressing issue for boom-bust realism.
- Temperature effects on maturation/juvenile survival: Not included; could be secondary for this iteration.

PARAMETER REVIEW
- T_opt_bleach is updated from literature (value 32.65 °C and bounds 31–34.3 °C). Its usage as a threshold (with exponential growth reduction and linear additional mortality per °C) is consistent with threshold-driven bleaching; no structural change required.
- Most other parameters remain initial estimates. Given their roles:
  - phi > 1 supports outbreak onset but needs a compensating high-density taper to avoid sustained outbreaks.
  - gammaC generates busts at high densities and is appropriate to retain.
  - wF, wS in recruitment represent a proxy resource term; kept for continuity, but flagged as ecologically coarse.

ONE ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT

Chosen approach: Add a high-density taper to the stock–recruitment function (Beverton–Holt type saturation on adult spawners).

Ecological justification:
- At high adult densities, fertilization success, egg production efficiency, larval survival, or settlement success saturate because of limited environmental capacity or density-dependent processes.
- This preserves rapid outbreak initiation (Allee + superlinearity at low-to-moderate densities) while preventing unrealistically long plateaus at peak abundance, better matching observed boom-bust timing and duration.

Mathematical change:
- Replace the purely superlinear stock term C^phi with a Beverton–Holt taper:
  stock_term = C^phi / (1 + C / C_sat_rec)
- Recruitment becomes:
  Rec = alpha_rec * stock_term * f_Allee * f_food * f_Trec + cotsimm
  where C_sat_rec is the characteristic adult density (ind m^-2) where recruitment begins to taper.
- Notes:
  - This retains the existing Allee effect (f_Allee) and temperature optimum (f_Trec).
  - cotsimm remains additive to preserve exogenous larval inputs.
  - This single additional parameter minimally increases complexity but adds a critical nonlinearity for outbreak duration realism.

New parameter:
- C_sat_rec (units: ind m^-2)
  - Ecological meaning: Half-saturation-like scale for adult density in the stock–recruitment relationship (Beverton–Holt taper).
  - Suggested bounds: lower_bound = 0.01, upper_bound = 50.0 (broad, covering sparse to dense adult fields).
  - Priority: 2 (important for dynamics, but estimable from data alongside existing recruitment parameters).

Assumptions and data usage:
- No use of current-year observations in state updates; only previous time step states are used.
- This change is compatible with the current data inputs and preserves the role of cotsimm_dat as an additive exogenous source.

NEXT STEPS ON RESIDUALS
- Please provide the residuals file to verify:
  - Reduction of positive residual bias at outbreak peaks (shorter/lower predicted peaks).
  - Improved timing of downturns (earlier bust onset).
  - Any remaining structure in coral residuals that would motivate subsequent tuning of functional response (e.g., etaF) or handling saturation (h).
