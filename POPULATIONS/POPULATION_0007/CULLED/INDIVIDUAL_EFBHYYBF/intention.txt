ASSESSMENT

Data fit:
- The residuals file was not provided, so I could not quantify fit. Structurally, the model uses lognormal observation error with a small delta for stability and avoids data leakage (only initial states use *_dat). Please share residuals to validate patterns (e.g., persistent positive residuals during outbreak peaks or phase-lag errors).

Project context alignment:
- The current model includes:
  - Coral community dynamics (fast/slow) with logistic growth, competition, background and bleaching mortality, and predation by COTS via a Holling type III functional response with selectivity.
  - COTS dynamics via a Ricker process modified by food (Acropora) and temperature, plus immigration filtered by coral-dependent settlement.
- This structure can generate regulation and environmental sensitivity, and immigration can induce pulses. However, a key mechanism for episodic outbreaks of COTS is missing: a fertilization Allee effect. COTS are broadcast spawners with strong density-dependent fertilization success; at low adult densities, per-capita recruitment is depressed, producing depensation. This mechanism helps create threshold-like outbreak initiation and contributes to boom-bust cycles when combined with environmental modifiers.

Potentially missing or oversimplified processes:
- Positive density dependence (Allee effect) in COTS reproduction at low adult density.
- Stage structure and delay (cryptic juveniles) – more complex to add.
- Exogenous nutrient pulses increasing larval survival – needs covariates.
- Predator control on juveniles – adds many parameters.

PARAMETER REVIEW

- Many parameters are annotated as literature or initial estimates; none flagged as updated_from_literature=true in the provided file. Current values are ecologically plausible (e.g., p_fast ≈ 0.8; q_FR ≈ 2; T_bleach ≈ 29.5 °C; sigma_T ≈ 1.5 °C). No scaling issues identified that force an equation structural change aside from the missing Allee mechanism.

CHOSEN ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT

Add a fertilization Allee effect to COTS growth:
- Mathematical form: f_allee(N) = N^q_allee / (A50_allee^q_allee + N^q_allee), with q_allee ≥ 1 and A50_allee > 0.
- Apply as a multiplicative factor on the per-capita growth term in the Ricker exponent:
  growth_term = r_cots * ((1 - gamma_food) + gamma_food * f_food_t) * f_temp_t
  growth_term <- growth_term * f_allee(N_{t-1})
- Ecological rationale: Broadcast spawning requires proximity; fertilization success rises sharply with density, yielding depensation at low densities. This makes outbreak initiation threshold-like and better captures episodic dynamics while preserving existing food and temperature effects.
- Parameters introduced:
  - allee_A50_raw (log scale). Transform: allee_A50 = exp(allee_A50_raw) ∈ (0, ∞).
  - q_allee_raw (log scale). Transform: q_allee = 1 + exp(q_allee_raw) ∈ [1, ∞).
- Suggested soft bounds (on natural scale via smooth penalties): allee_A50 ∈ [0.001, 10], q_allee ∈ [1, 5].
- Identifiability considerations: Allee parameters primarily influence low-density dynamics; they should be identifiable if the time series contains pre-outbreak phases. Immigration pulses (cotsimm_dat) remain essential triggers when populations are very low.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- No use of current-step *_dat response variables in prediction; only previous state values (cots_prev, fast_prev, slow_prev) and current covariates (sst_dat(t), cotsimm_dat(t)) are used, which is permitted.
- Added reporting for f_allee, and ADREPORT for transformed parameters (allee_A50, q_allee).
- No changes to the observation model.
