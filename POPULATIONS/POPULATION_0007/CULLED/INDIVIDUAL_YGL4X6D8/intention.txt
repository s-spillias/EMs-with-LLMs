Assessment:
The current model uses a fixed logistic function with a unit steepness to trigger outbreak effects, which may oversimplify the complex, non-linear population dynamics of COTS outbreaks. Observed epidemic outbreaks tend to display a sharper transition. By introducing an additional parameter, "outbreak_steepness", we enable a more flexible, non-linear outbreak trigger. This change improves the model's capacity to capture the rapid onset and decline of outbreaks, aligning better with ecological observations and enhancing prediction accuracy for the timing, magnitude, and duration of such events.
