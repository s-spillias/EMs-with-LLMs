Assessment: The current model fits the data moderately well, but it oversimplifies the outbreak dynamics by not accounting for a critical threshold that triggers rapid population explosions. To address the project context—accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of boom–bust cycles—we introduce a nonlinear outbreak amplifier. A sigmoid function, activated when COTS density exceeds a critical threshold (outbreak_threshold), amplifies the growth rate by a factor (outbreak_amplification). This mechanism reflects ecological realities where outbreak events are triggered only once densities reach a critical level.
