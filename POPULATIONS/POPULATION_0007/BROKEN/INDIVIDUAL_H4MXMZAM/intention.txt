Assessment and Improvement Rationale:

1. The current model uses an exponential growth term modulated by an environmental outbreak trigger;
   however, it does not account for the resource limitation imposed by coral cover.
2. Given that COTS outbreaks (boom-bust cycles) depend heavily on the availability of coral prey,
   feedback from coral depletion should slow starfish growth during prolonged outbreak conditions.
3. The proposed change incorporates a resource limitation mechanism by modulating the intrinsic growth
   rate of COTS with the combined available coral cover (fast + slow). This captures the ecological
   reasoning that abundant coral promotes growth, while declining coral restricts it.
4. Only previous time step values of the predictions are used, avoiding data leakage.
