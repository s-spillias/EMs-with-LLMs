Project Assessment:
1. Data Fit: Residual analysis suggested that the model was misfitting the predation dynamics.
2. Model Context: While the original model captures boom-bust cycles in COTS outbreaks, it oversimplifies the predation processes.
3. Ecological Improvement: A Michaelisâ€“Menten formulation for predation has been introduced. This reflects that as coral cover increases, predation rates saturate due to predator limitations. Two new parameters (half_sat_fast and half_sat_slow) represent the coral cover levels at which predation reaches half its maximum rate.
4. Note: All predictions continue to use only past state values to avoid data leakage.
