Assessment and rationale for model refinement

1) Fit to data
- The residuals file was not provided in this chat, so I cannot compute formal diagnostics. Please share it to refine this assessment.
- Based on structure, immediate addition of recruitment to the adult pool likely produces phase errors (adult peaks too closely tracking environmental pulses) and limits the persistence of outbreak plateaus, which can degrade fit when observations show delayed booms and multi-year busts.

2) Alignment with project context
- Strengths: The model includes Allee effects on recruitment, resource limitation via coral cover, temperature effects on recruitment and bleaching, multi-prey functional response with Type-II/III blend, and shared space competition between coral groups. These are aligned with COTS–coral dynamics on the GBR.
- Gap: The model lacks an explicit juvenile stage and maturation delay between larval settlement and adult emergence. Empirically, COTS exhibit a 1–3 year lag from spawning to measurable increases in adults. This lag is central to reproducing episodic boom–bust cycles and their timing relative to environmental drivers and coral cover.

3) Potentially missing or oversimplified processes
- Juvenile stage and maturation delay (key for outbreak timing).
- Optional: predator control and disease are omitted (acceptable unless data available).
- Immigration is included as an exogenous driver; leave as-is.
- Observation model seems adequate for current data streams.

Chosen improvement: add juvenile stage with maturation delay
- Approach: Indirect pathway and feedback mechanism.
- Implementation:
  - Recruitment now populates a juvenile compartment J (ind m^-2).
  - Adults increase via maturation mJ * J; adults still experience baseline and density-dependent mortality.
  - Juveniles experience proportional mortality muJ and maturation loss mJ.
  - All process calculations at time t use state and drivers from t-1 only (no data leakage).
- Equations:
  - Rec_{t-1} = alpha_rec * C_{t-1}^phi * f_Allee(C_{t-1}) * f_food(F_{t-1}, S_{t-1}) * f_Trec(SST_{t-1}) + cotsimm_{t-1}
  - C_t = C_{t-1} + mJ * J_{t-1} - (muC + gammaC * C_{t-1}) * C_{t-1}
  - J_t = J_{t-1} + Rec_{t-1} - mJ * J_{t-1} - muJ * J_{t-1}
  - Coral processes unchanged (growth, bleaching, and consumption).
- Parameters added:
  - mJ (yr^-1, 0–1): annual maturation fraction.
  - muJ (yr^-1, 0–1): annual juvenile mortality proportion.
  - Bounds reflect proportional interpretations and ensure stability in discrete-time updates.
- Initialization:
  - Juvenile state J_0 set to 0 (no observation available); this avoids parameterized initial conditions and preserves the no-leakage rule. The filter-up effect of Rec will populate J from year 1 onward.
- Expected benefits:
  - Introduces realistic delay between spawning and adult outbreaks, improving timing of peaks.
  - Allows build-up of juvenile cohorts leading to sharper booms and sustained plateaus before density-dependent adult mortality collapses the population, better matching observed boom–bust cycles.
  - Maintains existing ecological realism for coral dynamics and COTS–coral interactions.

Notes for future refinement (pending residuals review)
- If residuals show systematic early peaks, mJ may be too high; if peaks are too delayed or muted, mJ may be too low or muJ too high.
- If outbreak magnitudes are still underpredicted, consider allowing temperature and/or coral resource to also modulate juvenile survival (muJ) or maturation (mJ), but only if supported by data.
