Assessment:
----------
The current model captures basic COTS dynamics via logistic growth modified by environmental triggers and mortality, along with coral recovery and linear predation. However, using a purely linear predation term oversimplifies natural predation processes, which typically saturate at high prey densities. 

Improvement:
-----------
Introduce a saturating functional response in the predation term for both fast-growing and slow-growing corals by adding half‚Äêsaturation constants. This adjustment (via parameters log_half_sat_fast and log_half_sat_slow) reflects that predation rates tend to plateau when coral cover is high, better capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks and their ecological impacts.
