Assessment and Rationale:
The current model produces residuals that suggest a potential nonlinear relationship with sea surface temperature (SST). Although the trigger function currently considers SST linearly (1.0 + 0.1*sst + 0.05*cotsimm), ecological theory and observed outbreak patterns indicate that extreme SSTs might have disproportionate effects on outbreak initiation. 

To improve model realism and better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, we introduce a quadratic SST term in the trigger function. The new parameter `sst_quad_coef` will allow the model to flexibly adjust the curvature of the SST effect, representing the intensified impact of temperature extremes on outbreak dynamics.
