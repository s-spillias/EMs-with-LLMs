  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with several substantive formulation differences from the TRUTH Python model. Key matches: phytoplankton linear mortality and grazing-driven zooplankton growth (i.e., growth through grazing with an assimilation efficiency) and recycling from mortality/grazing are present. Key differences: phytoplankton nutrient uptake in the candidate is a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limited term and omits the TRUTH model's explicit light-dependent limitation (the a/(b + c*P) factor). Grazing is Holling type II (P/(K_p+P)) in the candidate vs. a Type III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) in TRUTH. Zooplankton mortality is quadratic in the candidate (m_z * Z^2) vs. linear in TRUTH. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton (k*(N0-N) and -(s+k)*P in TRUTH). The candidate also uses an Euler forward time-stepping implementation and a lognormal observation error model (implementation/modeling details, not additional ecological processes). Overall the candidate uses alternate, literature-common functional forms (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling II grazing, quadratic zooplankton mortality) rather than exact TRUTH matches for several components.",
