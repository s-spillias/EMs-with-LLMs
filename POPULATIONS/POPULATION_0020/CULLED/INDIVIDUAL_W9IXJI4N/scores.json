  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical roles (uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) but uses simpler/switching functional forms than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as classic Michaelis\u2013Menten (V_max * N/(K_n+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH's combined nutrient-and-P-dependent term (N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) * P). Grazing is a Holling type II (g_max * P/(K_p+P) * Z) instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) functional response. Recycling is present via (1-beta)*grazing plus linear mortality recycling (m_p*P, m_z*Z), but the candidate omits environmental mixing/entrainment (no k*(N0 - N) or P mixing term). Zooplankton growth and mortality appear in the usual assimilated-grazing minus linear death form. No additional ecological state variables or novel biogeochemical processes are introduced in the candidate (extra components count = 0).",
