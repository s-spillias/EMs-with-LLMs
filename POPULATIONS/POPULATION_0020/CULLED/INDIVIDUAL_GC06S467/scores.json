  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N, P, Z) with nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-mediated interactions and recycling, and zooplankton mortality. However the functional forms differ from the TRUTH model in key ways: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten V_max * N/(K_n+N) \u00d7 P rather than the TRUTH's combined nutrient + P-dependent light limitation a/(b+cP); grazing is Holling type II (g_max * P/(K_p+P) * Z) instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form; the candidate includes both linear and quadratic zooplankton mortality (m_z Z + m_z_q Z^2) and does not include an explicit mixing/dilution term (k*(N0-N) or (s+k)*P etc.) present in TRUTH. Overall the candidate matches many ecological roles but mostly via alternate (literature) functional forms, with one extra process (quadratic Z mortality).",
