  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth -> grazers assimilate a fraction of grazing and die), but with simpler functional forms than the TRUTH model. The candidate uses classic Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake and a Holling type II grazing (P/(K+P)) with linear mortality and instantaneous remineralization of mortalities/unassimilated grazing. The TRUTH model uses a more complex phytoplankton growth term (N/(e+N) multiplied by a/(b + c P)) and a Hill-type grazing with P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) (exponent 2), and it includes an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0 - N)) that the candidate lacks. Assimilation/mortality bookkeeping differs in detail (different coefficients and routing fractions), but all canonical roles are present except explicit nutrient mixing and explicit phytoplankton mixing/entrainment.",
