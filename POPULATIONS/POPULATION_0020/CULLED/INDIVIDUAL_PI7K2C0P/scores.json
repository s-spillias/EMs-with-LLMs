  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a classical NPZ structure but in a simplified form relative to the TRUTH model. It uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake and a Holling type II grazing functional response, linear (first-order) mortalities for P and Z, and returns recycling to N via unassimilated grazing and mortality. Key TRUTH-specific processes are missing or replaced: the TRUTH model uses a compound uptake term that includes an additional P-dependent (light/self-shading) factor (a/(b + c P)) and a type-III / Hill-like grazing term P^2/(mu^2 + P^2); it also contains explicit mixing/entrainment terms (k*(N0 - N) and k*P) and specific recycling parameterization (gamma*q*Z and r*P). The candidate also omits environmental mixing/entrainment altogether and uses a discrete Euler update (implementation detail) and a lognormal observation model (not an ecological process). Overall, all canonical ecological roles are present except mixing terms; forms are often alternate (Michaelis\u2013Menten and Holling-II) rather than exact TRUTH matches.",
