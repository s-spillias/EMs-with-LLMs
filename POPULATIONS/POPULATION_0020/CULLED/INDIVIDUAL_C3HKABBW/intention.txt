This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton ecosystem based on the Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) framework. It describes the flow of carbon through the lower trophic levels of the oceanic mixed layer. The model includes the following key processes:
1.  Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, limited by nutrient availability, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
2.  Phytoplankton growth, which is directly coupled to nutrient uptake.
3.  Zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton, represented by a Holling Type II functional response, which assumes a saturating predation rate at high phytoplankton densities.
4.  Zooplankton growth, based on an assimilation efficiency of grazed phytoplankton.
5.  Recycling of nutrients back into the inorganic pool through natural mortality of both phytoplankton and zooplankton, and from inefficient zooplankton grazing (excretion).
The model conserves total mass, ensuring that carbon is cycled within the system without external inputs or losses.
