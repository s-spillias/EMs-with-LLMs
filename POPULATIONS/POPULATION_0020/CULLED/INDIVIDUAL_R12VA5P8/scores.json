  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, phytoplankton loss by grazing and mortality, zooplankton growth from grazing and linear mortality) but uses simpler/higher-level functional forms than the TRUTH model. Specifically, the candidate uses classical Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation for uptake and a Holling type II grazing function (P/(K_P+P)), whereas the TRUTH model uses a more complex uptake term that combines N-limitation with an additional P-dependent modifier (a/(b + c*P)) and a quadratic/sigmoidal grazing formulation P^2/(mu^2 + P^2). The candidate includes instantaneous recycling from unassimilated grazing and from dead P and Z, matching the ecological role of recycling in TRUTH though via different algebra. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and does not include explicit physical loss (mixing) for phytoplankton that is present in TRUTH. Implementation-level extras (observation likelihood, soft parameter penalties, forward-Euler integrator, small-number guards) are present but are modeling/estimation details rather than novel ecological processes.",
