  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing by zooplankton, recycling from grazing and mortalities, and linear mortalities for P and Z. However the functional forms differ from the TRUTH in key ways: uptake is simple Michaelis-Menten (no explicit light limitation factor present in TRUTH), grazing is Holling type II rather than the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (a type-III/quadratic numerator) form, and there is no environmental mixing/entrainment term for N, P, or Z. Assimilation-efficiency-based growth for Z and linear mortalities match the canonical roles in TRUTH but use different parameter names and grazing kernels.",

TRUTH uses a more complex form '(N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c*P))*P' (nutrient and light/biomass limitation). The candidate therefore matches an alternate (Michaelis-Menten) rather than the exact TRUTH form."

TRUTH includes recycling terms but with different partitioning and parameterization (e.g. 'r*P' and terms involving 'beta * lambda_*P^2/(mu^2+P^2) * Z' and 'gamma * q * Z'). The candidate's (1-beta)*grazing and explicit mortality-to-N terms are plausible recycling implementations but are not the same algebraic form as the TRUTH and are not one of the enumerated alternates exactly, so rated SIMILAR_NOT_LISTED."
