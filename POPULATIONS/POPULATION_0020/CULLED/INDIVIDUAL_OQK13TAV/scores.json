  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard, simpler NPZ: Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by P, Holling type-II grazing, linear mortality for P and Z, and recycling of a fraction of grazing plus mortalities back to nutrients. It omits TRUTH's explicit light/packaging limitation (the a/(b+cP) term), omits the environmental mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N)) and the TRUTH grazing functional form (P^2/(mu^2+P^2) \u2014 a sigmoidal/Type-III form). The candidate therefore matches many canonical ecological roles but typically via alternate (simpler) mathematical choices (Michaelis-Menten uptake, Holling II grazing, linear mortality and recycling via (1-beta)*grazing). It also contains non-ecological implementation extras (numerical Euler integration, positivity enforcement, observation/error model).",
