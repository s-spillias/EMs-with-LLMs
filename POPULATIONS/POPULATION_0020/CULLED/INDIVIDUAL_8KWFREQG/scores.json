  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ with Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, Holling type-II grazing, assimilation-based zooplankton growth, and linear mortalities. It therefore captures the core ecological roles (uptake \u2192 P, grazing \u2192 Z, recycling \u2192 N) but uses alternate functional forms for uptake/grazing compared with the TRUTH model: TRUTH uses a product of nutrient limitation and a P-dependent light/self-shading factor and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Type-III-like) grazing, plus an explicit mixing term for N. The candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for N (and P/Z), and replaces some TRUTH terms with simpler linear mortality/recycling and a Holling-II grazing. The candidate also includes implementation features (Euler integration, positivity constraint, lognormal observation model) that are computational/observation-model choices but not new ecological processes.",
