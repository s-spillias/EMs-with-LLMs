  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N, P, Z with uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) but uses simpler/alternate functional forms compared with the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are Michaelis-Menten in the candidate (no explicit light/self-shading dependence on P), grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) vs Holling Type III\u2013like (TRUTH). Mortality for P and Z are linear in both models and map directly. The candidate omits the explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH and also omits phytoplankton mixing/sinking. Several implementation choices (Euler forward integration, positivity enforcement, lognormal observation error and penalty terms) are present in the C++ code but are implementation/observation components rather than new ecological processes.",
