  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N, P, Z with uptake, grazing, mortality, and recycling) but uses different functional forms than the TRUTH reference for several key processes. Phytoplankton uptake is implemented as a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten term in N (no explicit light/self-shading factor present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling Type II (candidate) versus a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (sigmoidal/Type III-like) form in TRUTH. Recycling in the candidate is represented as (1-beta)*grazing plus mortality recycling (linear and an extra quadratic Z^2 term) rather than the TRUTH's mixture of r*P and predator-driven recycling terms. The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton. An extra ecological process in the candidate is quadratic zooplankton mortality (m_z2 * Z^2). Numerical integration (Euler forward) and observation/error model pieces are present in the candidate but are not ecological processes.",
