  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles: nutrient uptake by phytoplankton (Michaelis-Menten), grazing by zooplankton (Holling-type saturating), recycling of a fraction of grazing back to nutrients, and linear mortality for P and Z. However it omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term present in the TRUTH model and it uses simpler functional forms for uptake and grazing (Michaelis-Menten and Holling II) rather than the compound nutrient+light limitation and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (Type III) grazing used in TRUTH. The candidate also implements non-ecological numerical/estimation features (Euler integration, positivity enforcement, lognormal observation model) that are not ecological processes.",
