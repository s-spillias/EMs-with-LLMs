  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements a conventional NPZ structure: Monod-type nutrient uptake, Holling type II grazing, linear mortality for P and Z, and recycling of nutrients via unassimilated grazing plus mortality returns. Compared with the TRUTH (ground-truth) model, the candidate lacks the TRUTH's grazing functional form (TRUTH uses a Type-III P^2/(mu^2+P^2) term), lacks the TRUTH nutrient/light-modulating factor a/(b + c*P) in the uptake term, and omits the explicit physical mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient and phytoplankton equations (k*(N0 - N) and the k*P mixing contribution). The candidate also implements observation/likelihood machinery, positivity enforcement, Euler integration and optimizer parameter penalties (implementation features, not ecological processes). Overall the candidate is an ecologically plausible alternate NPZ formulation (Monod uptake + Holling-II grazing + linear mortality and recycling) but is not a structural match to the TRUTH in grazing nonlinearity or mixing terms.",
