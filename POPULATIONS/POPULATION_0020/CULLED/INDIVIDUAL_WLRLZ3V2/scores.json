  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ formulation but differs from the TRUTH model in a few key mechanistic choices. The candidate uses a single Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake term (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) with no explicit light/self-shading term, a Holling Type II grazing (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z), instantaneous recycling from unassimilated grazing ((1-beta)*grazing) and linear mortalities returned to nutrients (m_P*P, m_Z*Z). It omits the TRUTH model's mixing/entrainment term in nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and the explicit light/self-shading limitation term that appears multiplicatively in the TRUTH uptake. Zooplankton growth and mortalities are represented with the same conceptual components (assimilation* grazing minus linear mortality) but with a different functional form for grazing and different parameter names. The candidate also contains implementation/estimation components (observation likelihood, parameter soft-penalties, non-negativity floor, forward Euler solver) that are statistical/numerical rather than new ecological processes.",
