  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard, simpler NPZ formulation: Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by P (bilinear uptake), Holling type II grazing, linear (first-order) mortality for P and Z, and recycling via excretion fraction of grazing plus mortality terms. It omits the TRUTH model's extra nonlinearity in uptake (the a/(b + c*P) light/self-shading factor), the TRUTH nonlinear P^2/(mu^2+P^2) grazing functional form, and the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N). The candidate therefore matches canonical ecological roles but generally as alternate (simpler) functional forms; several TRUTH-specific terms are not present.",
