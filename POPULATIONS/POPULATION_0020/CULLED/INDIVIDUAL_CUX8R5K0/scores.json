  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements a standard 3-state NPZ with Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, a Holling-type grazing, linear mortality terms, and immediate recycling of unassimilated grazing and mortalities into nutrients. Many ecological roles from the TRUTH model are present but several functional forms differ: uptake in the TRUTH is multiplicative (nutrient Michaelis-Menten times an additional P-dependent light/competition term) and grazing in the TRUTH is a Type-III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) form; the candidate uses a simpler Michaelis-Menten (N/(K_N+N))*P uptake and a Holling type-II grazing (P/(K_P+P)). The candidate omits the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in dN/dt (k*(N0-N)) and omits explicit mixing losses in P and Z present/possible in TRUTH. Observation/error and numerical-integration details are present in the candidate but are not ecological processes.",
