This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton ecosystem, consisting of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z). The model is based on the following interactions:
- Phytoplankton growth is dependent on nutrient availability, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
- Zooplankton graze on phytoplankton, represented by a Holling Type II functional response.
- A fraction of grazed phytoplankton is assimilated into zooplankton biomass.
- Both phytoplankton and zooplankton experience natural mortality.
- Dead organic matter from phytoplankton and zooplankton, along with unassimilated grazed matter, is assumed to be instantaneously remineralized back into the nutrient pool.
This structure creates a closed system where nutrient cycling drives the population dynamics of the plankton community.
