  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but with several formulation differences from the TRUTH reference. It uses Monod/Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake (uptake = V_max * N/(K_n+N) * P) and a Holling type-II grazing (grazing = g_max * P/(K_p+P) * Z). Zooplankton growth is the assimilated fraction of grazing (beta * grazing) and nutrient recycling is applied as the non-assimilated fraction (1-beta)*grazing plus mortality recycling. The candidate uses linear phytoplankton mortality and quadratic zooplankton mortality, and it does not include an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term or the TRUTH-specific P-saturating light term (a/(b + c*P)) or the external nutrient source k*(N0-N). Numerical/observation features (Euler integration, positivity clamps, lognormal observation likelihood, parameter penalties) are present but are not ecological processes.",
