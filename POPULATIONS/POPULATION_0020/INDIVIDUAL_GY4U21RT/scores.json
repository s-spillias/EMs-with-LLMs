  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the canonical NPZ roles (nutrient uptake -> phytoplankton growth, grazing -> zooplankton growth, mortality -> recycling) but uses simpler, alternate functional forms compared with the TRUTH model. Specifically, the candidate uses Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake and Holling type-II grazing with linear mortalities and an explicit assimilation parameter. It lacks the TRUTH model's Type\u2011III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) grazing, the TRUTH phytoplankton light/ self-shading term a/(b + c P), and the explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term k*(N0 - N). Non-ecological additions include an Euler time-stepping implementation, positivity enforcement, lognormal observation error, and optimizer penalties.",

This is the standard unassimilated-grazing+(mortality) recycling form.
