This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton food web, consisting of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z). The model is based on a system of coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the flow of carbon between these three compartments.

Key ecological processes include:
1.  Phytoplankton Growth: Phytoplankton consume nutrients for growth, following a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) uptake kinetic. Growth is thus limited by nutrient availability.
2.  Zooplankton Grazing: Zooplankton graze on phytoplankton, with a Holling Type II functional response, meaning their consumption rate saturates at high phytoplankton concentrations.
3.  Nutrient Regeneration: Nutrients are recycled back into the system through several pathways: sloppy eating and excretion by zooplankton, and the remineralization of dead phytoplankton and zooplankton.
4.  Mortality: Both phytoplankton and zooplankton experience mortality. Phytoplankton have a linear mortality rate, while zooplankton have a quadratic mortality term, which represents processes like predation by higher trophic levels and helps stabilize the population.

The model is designed to be fitted to time-series data of N, P, and Z concentrations, allowing for the estimation of key ecological parameters that govern the plankton dynamics.
