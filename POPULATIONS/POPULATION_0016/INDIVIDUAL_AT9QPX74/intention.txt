Assessment:
- The current model captures basic COTS-coral feedbacks and environmental drivers, but may not fully reproduce the abrupt onset and collapse of COTS outbreaks observed in nature.
- Key ecological process missing: an Allee effect (reduced recruitment at low COTS densities due to mate limitation), which is important for generating realistic boom-bust cycles.

Chosen improvement:
- Add an Allee effect to the COTS recruitment term. This will suppress recruitment at low COTS densities, making outbreaks less likely to spontaneously arise from very low populations and allowing for more realistic outbreak timing and duration.

Mathematical implementation:
- Modify the COTS recruitment term to include a factor: (cots_prev / (A + cots_prev)), where A is a new Allee threshold parameter.
- This term is near zero at very low COTS densities, and approaches 1 at high densities.

Ecological justification:
- Mate limitation and fertilization failure at low COTS densities are well-documented and critical for outbreak dynamics (see Pratchett et al. 2017, "Booms, Busts, and Population Resilience of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish").
- Including this effect improves the model's ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks, as required by the project context.
