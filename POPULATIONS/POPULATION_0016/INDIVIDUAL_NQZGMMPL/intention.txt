Assessment:
- The current model captures the main ecological interactions between COTS and coral, including resource limitation, environmental drivers, and feedbacks.
- However, the outbreak threshold is modeled as a smooth sigmoid function of coral cover, which may not fully capture the abrupt, episodic nature of real COTS outbreaks.
- Real-world outbreaks are often characterized by nonlinear positive feedbacks, where high COTS densities facilitate further recruitment and rapid population explosions.

Improvement:
- To better capture the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks, I am adding a nonlinear positive feedback to the COTS recruitment term.
- This is implemented as a higher-order (quadratic) function of previous COTS density, controlled by a new parameter `phi`.
- Ecological justification: Positive density-dependent feedbacks (e.g., aggregation, facilitation, predator swamping) are known to contribute to the explosive, self-reinforcing nature of COTS outbreaks.

Implementation:
- Added parameter `log_phi_feedback` to control the strength of the positive feedback.
- Modified the COTS recruitment term in the process model to include this feedback.
- This change should allow the model to generate more abrupt, episodic outbreaks, improving fit to observed boom-bust cycles.
