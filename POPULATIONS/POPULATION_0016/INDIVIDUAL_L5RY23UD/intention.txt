Assessment:
- The current model includes resource limitation, environmental drivers, and feedbacks between COTS and coral, but does not fully capture the episodic, explosive nature of COTS outbreaks.
- The outbreak threshold is a smooth function of coral cover, but there is no explicit positive feedback in COTS recruitment based on previous COTS abundance, which is a key ecological process in outbreak dynamics.
- Field studies indicate that high COTS densities can amplify recruitment in subsequent years, leading to rapid population booms.

Improvement:
- Add a lagged positive feedback mechanism to COTS recruitment, where high COTS abundance in the previous year increases recruitment in the current year.
- This is implemented as a saturating Hill-type function of previous COTS abundance, controlled by a new parameter (phi_cots).
- This change is ecologically justified as it allows the model to generate sharper, more episodic outbreaks, better matching observed boom-bust cycles and the timing/magnitude of population explosions.
