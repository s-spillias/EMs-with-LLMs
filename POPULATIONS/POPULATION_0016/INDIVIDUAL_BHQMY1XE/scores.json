  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes but with some structural differences. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by a self-shading light limitation (algebraically equivalent to the TRUTH light factor), and phytoplankton grazing is a Holling type\u2011III form matching the TRUTH functional family. Phytoplankton linear mortality is present, matching TRUTH. Zooplankton growth via assimilated grazing is present and matches TRUTH conceptually; however the candidate uses quadratic (density\u2011dependent) zooplankton mortality (an alternate formulation) and omits an explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for N, P, and Z that TRUTH includes for nutrients (k*(N0-N)) and for phytoplankton (mixing appears as k*P in TRUTH). The candidate adds a new detritus pool (D) with detritus grazing, remineralization and sinking (extra processes not in TRUTH).",
