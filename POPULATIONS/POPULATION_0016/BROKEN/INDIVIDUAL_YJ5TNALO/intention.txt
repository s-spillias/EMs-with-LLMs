Assessment:
- The current model captures key processes for COTS outbreaks and coral dynamics, including resource limitation, temperature effects, and predation.
- However, it oversimplifies the feedback between coral prey availability (especially Acropora) and COTS recruitment/survival.
- In reality, COTS outbreaks are sustained by high coral cover, but populations crash rapidly when coral is depleted. The current model's logistic limitation may not produce sharp enough busts.

Improvement:
- I am adding a saturating (Michaelis-Menten) dependence of COTS recruitment on fast coral (Acropora) cover.
- This introduces a direct, non-linear feedback: COTS recruitment is high when Acropora is abundant, but drops sharply as Acropora is depleted, accelerating outbreak collapse.
- This is ecologically justified and should improve the timing and magnitude of boom-bust cycles.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter (log_h_cots_coral) controlling the half-saturation of Acropora effect on COTS recruitment.
- Modify the COTS recruitment term to include this feedback.
