Assessment:
- The current model captures the main processes (COTS growth, resource limitation, predation, coral recovery, SST effects) and should reproduce general boom-bust cycles.
- However, it uses fixed conversion efficiencies for COTS, which may not reflect ecological reality during outbreaks when high COTS densities lead to interference and reduced efficiency.
- This missing negative feedback may cause the model to overestimate outbreak magnitude/duration and not fully capture the self-limiting nature of outbreaks.

Improvement:
- I will introduce density-dependent conversion efficiency for COTS predation on coral. As COTS density increases, the efficiency of converting consumed coral into new COTS biomass will decrease.
- This is ecologically justified by increased interference and competition at high COTS densities, which is well-documented in outbreaking species.
- This feedback should help the model better capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, as well as the collapse phase.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter (gamma_eff) controlling the strength of density dependence.
- Modify the model so that e_fast and e_slow are multiplied by an exponential decay function of COTS density: e.g., e_fast_eff = e_fast * exp(-gamma_eff * cots_pred(t-1)).
- This approach is simple, interpretable, and adds only one parameter, but introduces an important ecological feedback missing from the current model.
