Assessment:
- The current model captures COTS boom-bust cycles via density-dependent recruitment, temperature effects, and immigration, and includes selective predation on fast and slow corals. However, it lacks a direct feedback from coral cover to COTS recruitment/survival, which is ecologically important for terminating outbreaks and preventing COTS persistence when coral is depleted.
- Resource limitation for COTS is currently only via COTS density (logistic), not by food (coral) availability.
- This may allow COTS outbreaks to persist unrealistically even when coral cover is low.

Ecological improvement:
- I added a saturating (Michaelis-Menten) dependence of COTS recruitment on total coral cover (fast + slow). This means COTS recruitment is reduced when coral is depleted, providing a negative feedback that helps end outbreaks and better matches observed boom-bust dynamics.
- This is implemented by multiplying the COTS recruitment term by (coral_total/(h_coral + coral_total)), where coral_total = fast_pred(t-1) + slow_pred(t-1) and h_coral is a new half-saturation parameter.
- This mechanism is ecologically justified because COTS larvae and juveniles depend on coral for settlement and survival, especially Acropora, and outbreaks cannot be sustained without sufficient prey.
