This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their interactions with two key coral groups: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. The model predicts the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks by incorporating:

- Resource limitation via saturating and threshold functional responses for COTS predation on corals.
- Environmental drivers (e.g., sea surface temperature, larval immigration) that can trigger or sustain outbreaks.
- Feedbacks between COTS abundance and coral cover, including selective predation and coral recovery.
- Process-specific efficiencies (e.g., conversion of consumed coral to COTS biomass).
- Smooth, numerically stable transitions and penalties to ensure robust parameter estimation.

The model is designed for use with time series data, predicting annual COTS abundance and coral cover, and is suitable for scenario analysis and forecasting under changing environmental conditions.
