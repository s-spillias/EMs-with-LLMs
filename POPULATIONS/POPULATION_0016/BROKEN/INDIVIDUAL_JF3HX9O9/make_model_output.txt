Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

 1 Model Fit: Without the residuals file, I cannot quantitatively assess fit, but the model structure suggests it can capture general boom-bust cycles and coral-COTS interactions. However, the current model uses simple Michaelis-Menten (Type II) predation and logistic growth, which may not fully capture the sharpness and duration of COTS outbreaks.                         
 2 Project Context: The model addresses the main ecological interactions (COTS recruitment, predation on corals, temperature effects, immigration), but may oversimplify the triggers and sustainers of outbreaks. In particular, the COTS recruitment term is a simple logistic function, which may not capture the hypothesised Allee effect (reduced recruitment at low densities)  
   known to be important for COTS outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 3 Missing Processes: A key ecological process often discussed for COTS is the Allee effect—where population growth is reduced at low densities due to difficulties in finding mates or fertilisation success. This can create a threshold for outbreak initiation and collapse, which is central to the boom-bust dynamics.                                                           

Chosen Improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

 • Add an Allee effect to COTS recruitment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
    • Justification: The Allee effect is well-supported in COTS ecology and is critical for accurately capturing outbreak thresholds and durations. It is a minimal but ecologically meaningful addition that can be implemented by modifying the COTS recruitment term to include a density threshold below which recruitment is strongly reduced.                                    
    • Mathematical Form: Modify the COTS recruitment term to:

      where A_cots is the Allee threshold parameter (in indiv/m2). This saturating function reduces recruitment at low densities and approaches 1 at high densities.

 Assessment:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 1. The current model structure captures the main interactions between COTS and coral communities and includes environmental drivers and immigration. However, the COTS recruitment term is a simple logistic function, which may not fully capture the sharpness and duration of COTS outbreaks observed in the field.                                                                
 2. The model addresses the project context by representing boom-bust cycles and selective predation, but it may oversimplify the mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 3. A key missing ecological process is the Allee effect in COTS recruitment, where low population densities lead to reduced recruitment due to mate limitation and fertilisation success. This effect is well-documented for COTS and is critical for accurately capturing outbreak thresholds and durations.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Chosen improvement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 - I have added an Allee effect to the COTS recruitment term. This is implemented as a saturating function of COTS density, reducing recruitment at low densities and allowing for threshold-like outbreak dynamics. This addition is ecologically justified and minimally increases model complexity while directly addressing a key process for outbreak initiation and collapse.    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 Implementation:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 - Added a new parameter `log_A_cots` (log Allee threshold for COTS recruitment) to parameters.json.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 - Modified the COTS recruitment term in model.cpp to include the Allee effect:
