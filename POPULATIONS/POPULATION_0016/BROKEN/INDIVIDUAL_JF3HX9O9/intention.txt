Assessment:
1. The current model structure captures the main interactions between COTS and coral communities and includes environmental drivers and immigration. However, the COTS recruitment term is a simple logistic function, which may not fully capture the sharpness and duration of COTS outbreaks observed in the field.
2. The model addresses the project context by representing boom-bust cycles and selective predation, but it may oversimplify the mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreaks.
3. A key missing ecological process is the Allee effect in COTS recruitment, where low population densities lead to reduced recruitment due to mate limitation and fertilisation success. This effect is well-documented for COTS and is critical for accurately capturing outbreak thresholds and durations.

Chosen improvement:
- I have added an Allee effect to the COTS recruitment term. This is implemented as a saturating function of COTS density, reducing recruitment at low densities and allowing for threshold-like outbreak dynamics. This addition is ecologically justified and minimally increases model complexity while directly addressing a key process for outbreak initiation and collapse.

Implementation:
- Added a new parameter `log_A_cots` (log Allee threshold for COTS recruitment) to parameters.json.
- Modified the COTS recruitment term in model.cpp to include the Allee effect: 
    recruit_cots = r_cots * cots_pred(t-1) * (1.0 - cots_pred(t-1)/K_cots) * (cots_pred(t-1)/(A_cots + cots_pred(t-1))) * temp_eff_cots;
- This change should improve the model's ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks as required by the project context.
