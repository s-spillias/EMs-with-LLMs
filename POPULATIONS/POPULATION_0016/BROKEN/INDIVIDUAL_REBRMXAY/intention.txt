Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, and includes penalties for parameter bounds. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here. The structure suggests a reasonable fit for capturing general trends, but the model may struggle with the precise timing and magnitude of outbreak peaks and busts, especially if environmental triggers or feedbacks are not sufficiently flexible.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model incorporates key processes: COTS logistic growth, coral predation (with selectivity), SST effects, immigration, and a smooth outbreak threshold based on total coral cover. These mechanisms are ecologically relevant for boom-bust dynamics and selective predation. However, the outbreak threshold is implemented as a smooth step function, which may oversimplify the abruptness and feedbacks observed in real outbreaks.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: The outbreak threshold is a simple sigmoid function of total coral cover, which may not capture the non-linear, potentially abrupt, or hysteretic nature of COTS outbreaks. Additionally, the effect of coral cover on COTS growth is only through this threshold, not as a continuous, saturating resource limitation.

Chosen Improvement:
I propose to enhance the resource limitation mechanism on COTS population growth by introducing a saturating (Michaelis-Menten type) functional response of COTS growth to total coral cover, in addition to the outbreak threshold. This allows COTS population growth to respond non-linearly to available coral, better capturing the ecological reality that COTS require a minimum coral cover to sustain outbreaks, but also that growth saturates at high coral cover. This approach is ecologically justified as it reflects both the necessity of sufficient food for outbreaks and the diminishing returns at high coral abundance.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter: log_K_coral (log half-saturation constant for coral cover effect on COTS growth).
- Modify the COTS population update equation so that the logistic growth term is multiplied by a saturating function of total coral cover: (coral_total_prev / (coral_total_prev + K_coral)).
- Retain the outbreak threshold effect for abruptness, but allow the saturating function to modulate growth continuously.
- This change adds ecological realism and mathematical flexibility, improving the model's ability to capture the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks.
