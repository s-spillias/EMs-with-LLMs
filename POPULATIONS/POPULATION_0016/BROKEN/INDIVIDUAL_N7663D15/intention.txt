This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between adult COTS, fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.), and slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites spp.), capturing selective predation by COTS on these coral groups. Outbreaks are triggered and sustained by a combination of resource availability (coral cover), environmental conditions (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval immigration), and feedbacks between COTS and coral communities. Resource limitation is modeled using saturating (Michaelis-Menten) and threshold functions, with process-specific efficiencies and environmental modifiers. The model incorporates indirect effects, such as coral recovery following COTS declines, and uses smooth transitions and penalties to ensure numerical stability. Predictions are made for each time step using only information from previous time steps, enabling robust forecasting of future ecosystem states.
