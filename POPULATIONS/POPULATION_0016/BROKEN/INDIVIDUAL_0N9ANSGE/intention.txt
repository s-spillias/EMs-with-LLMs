Assessment:
- The current model captures basic COTS boom-bust dynamics and coral predation, but may not fully reproduce the abruptness of outbreak collapses observed in nature.
- Key ecological process missing: density-dependent (quadratic) mortality for COTS, which is important for terminating outbreaks via mechanisms such as disease or intraspecific competition.

Improvement:
- Add a quadratic mortality term to the COTS population equation: mortality = m_cots * COTS + m2_cots * COTS^2
- This allows mortality to increase rapidly at high COTS densities, enabling more realistic outbreak collapses.
- Parameter 'log_m2_cots' (log of quadratic mortality coefficient) is added to parameters.json with ecological justification.

Ecological justification:
- Outbreaking species often experience density-dependent mortality due to disease, cannibalism, or resource depletion.
- Including this term improves the model's ability to capture the timing and magnitude of COTS population crashes, a key feature of episodic outbreaks.

Implementation:
- Add 'log_m2_cots' parameter to parameters.json.
- Update model.cpp to include quadratic mortality in COTS dynamics.
