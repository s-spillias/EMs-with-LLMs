This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their predation on coral communities. The model tracks three main state variables: adult COTS abundance, fast-growing coral cover (Acropora spp.), and slow-growing coral cover (Faviidae and Porites spp.). COTS population dynamics are driven by density-dependent recruitment, resource (coral) availability, and environmental forcing (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval immigration). Outbreaks are triggered by favorable environmental conditions and/or increased larval supply, and are sustained by high coral prey availability, with saturating functional responses to capture resource limitation and predation efficiency. Coral cover declines due to COTS predation, with differential vulnerability between fast- and slow-growing corals, and recovers via intrinsic growth, subject to resource limitation and environmental modification. Feedbacks include the reduction of COTS recruitment and survival at low coral cover, and indirect effects of environmental variables on both COTS and coral processes. The model is designed for robust prediction of outbreak timing, magnitude, and duration, and for exploring the ecological mechanisms underlying COTS-driven coral decline and recovery.
