Assessment:
- The current model includes lagged state variables, lognormal likelihoods, and environmental (SST) effects, and models COTSâ€“coral dynamics with selective predation and recovery.
- However, the resource limitation for COTS is a simple weighted sum of coral cover, which may not capture the abrupt population crashes observed after outbreaks.
- The model may underrepresent the non-linear, saturating limitation of COTS recruitment when coral is depleted, potentially smoothing over the sharp boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS outbreaks.

Chosen improvement:
- Introduce a saturating (Michaelis-Menten) resource limitation for COTS population growth, replacing the current linear resource term.
- This will allow COTS recruitment to be strongly limited when coral cover is low, better capturing the collapse phase of outbreaks and improving the timing and magnitude of population peaks and crashes.
- Add a new parameter, K_resource (half-saturation constant for coral resource availability), to control the nonlinearity.

Ecological justification:
- Outbreaks of COTS are often followed by rapid declines as coral prey is depleted; a saturating resource limitation better reflects this feedback and is supported by ecological theory for consumer-resource systems.
- This change is expected to improve model fit to observed boom-bust cycles and outbreak durations.

Implementation:
- Add log_K_resource to parameters.json.
- In model.cpp, replace the linear resource term in COTS growth with a Michaelis-Menten saturating function using K_resource.
