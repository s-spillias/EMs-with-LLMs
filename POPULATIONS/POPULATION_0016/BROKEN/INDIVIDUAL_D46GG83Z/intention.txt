Assessment:
- The current model captures the main features of COTS outbreaks, including logistic growth, selective predation, coral recovery, and environmental effects.
- However, the outbreak threshold is implemented as a smooth step function of total coral cover, which may be too simplistic.
- In reality, COTS population growth should be limited by coral food availability in a continuous, saturating manner, not just a threshold.

Improvement:
- Replace the outbreak threshold effect with a saturating food limitation function: food_lim = coral_total_prev / (coral_total_prev + K_food)
- This provides a gradual limitation on COTS growth as coral is depleted, better capturing the decline phase of outbreaks and preventing unrealistically high COTS growth when coral is scarce.
- Add a new parameter log_K_food (log half-saturation constant for food limitation).
- Remove the current outbreak threshold effect from the COTS growth equation and use the new food_lim term instead.

Ecological justification:
- This change reflects the continuous, saturating effect of coral prey availability on COTS population growth, which is supported by ecological theory and observations of boom-bust cycles in COTS populations.
