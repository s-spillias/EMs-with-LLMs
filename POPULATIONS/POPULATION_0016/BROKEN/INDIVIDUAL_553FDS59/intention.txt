Assessment:
- The current model captures the main ecological processes driving COTS outbreaks, including logistic growth, selective predation, coral recovery, SST effects, and an outbreak threshold based on total coral cover.
- However, the outbreak threshold is implemented as a smooth sigmoid, which may not produce sufficiently sharp boom-bust cycles observed in real COTS populations.
- The model may underpredict the abruptness of COTS collapse after coral depletion, as seen in empirical data.

Improvement:
- Replace the smooth sigmoid outbreak threshold with a Hill function (generalized logistic) to allow for a sharper, more ecologically realistic transition between outbreak and collapse.
- This introduces a new parameter (hill_n) controlling the steepness of the outbreak threshold, enabling the model to better capture the timing and magnitude of COTS population explosions and crashes.
- Ecological justification: COTS outbreaks are triggered when coral cover exceeds a threshold, but populations collapse rapidly when coral is depleted. The Hill function provides a flexible, non-linear feedback mechanism that better reflects this dynamic.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter 'log_hill_n' (log-transformed for estimation stability) to parameters.json.
- In model.cpp, replace the sigmoid outbreak threshold with the Hill function using hill_n = exp(log_hill_n).
