Assessment:
- The current model captures many key ecological processes relevant to COTS outbreaks, including feedbacks between COTS and coral, environmental drivers, and resource limitation.
- However, the resource limitation on COTS is modeled as a saturating function of *total* coral cover (fast + slow), which may oversimplify the selective nature of COTS feeding and outbreak dynamics.
- Ecological evidence suggests that COTS outbreaks are primarily sustained by fast-growing Acropora (fast coral), and that COTS populations can crash abruptly when fast coral is depleted, even if slow coral remains.

Improvement:
- Refine the COTS carrying capacity to depend more strongly on fast coral cover, with a weaker contribution from slow coral cover.
- Implement this by introducing new parameters `w_fast` and `w_slow` to weight the contribution of fast and slow coral to COTS carrying capacity.
- This change better captures the abruptness of busts and the selectivity of resource limitation, improving the model's ability to simulate boom-bust cycles and outbreak collapses.
