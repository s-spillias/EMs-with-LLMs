Assessment:
1. The current model captures general COTS boom-bust cycles and coral decline/recovery, but the outbreak trigger is a smooth function of coral cover, which may not generate the sharp, episodic outbreaks observed in nature.
2. The model addresses most key processes (logistic COTS growth, selective predation, coral recovery, SST and immigration effects), but the outbreak mechanism is likely too gradual.
3. Missing/oversimplified: The outbreak trigger lacks a sharp threshold, which is ecologically important for capturing sudden COTS population explosions.

Improvement:
To better represent the abrupt onset of COTS outbreaks, I will replace the current outbreak threshold function with a Hill (sigmoidal) function. This introduces a new parameter (hill_outbreak) controlling the sharpness of the outbreak trigger. This change is ecologically justified, as field observations show outbreaks are triggered rapidly when coral cover exceeds a threshold. The Hill function allows for more realistic, episodic boom-bust dynamics without excessive complexity.
