  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements the same broad NPZ roles (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth \u2192 remineralization/mortality) but uses different functional forms in several places and omits an explicit mixing/entrainment term present in the TRUTH model. Uptake and grazing in the candidate are standard Monod / Holling-II forms (common alternates) rather than the TRUTH's combined nutrient+light limitation and P^2-based (sigmoidal) grazing. The candidate adds density-dependent quadratic mortality for both P and Z (extra processes not in TRUTH). Several recycling pathways are present but differ in algebraic form from TRUTH (e.g., candidate uses direct linear Z\u2192N excretion and P^2 mortality\u2192N whereas TRUTH includes a grazing-dependent saturating return and a separate fraction of zooplankton mortality returned).",
