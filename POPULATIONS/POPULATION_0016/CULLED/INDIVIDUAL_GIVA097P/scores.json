  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes (nutrient uptake driving phytoplankton growth, Holling-type III grazing transferring biomass to zooplankton, assimilation, mortality, and recycling) but differs from the TRUTH formulation in three main ways: (1) nutrient uptake/growth is a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten form (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH's coupled N/(e+N) * (a/(b + c P)) * P (i.e., missing the explicit P-dependent light/shading factor a/(b+cP)); (2) there is an explicit combined remineralization term of dead organic matter (epsilon*(p_mortality+z_mortality)) not present in the TRUTH in that form; and (3) the candidate omits explicit environmental mixing/entrainment terms (k*(N0 - N), and the (s+k)*P and k terms in TRUTH). Grazing and assimilated grazing (zooplankton growth) are algebraically the same Holling type III forms and therefore match the TRUTH grazing structure. Several mortality terms are present but include quadratic forms as alternates to the TRUTH's primarily linear losses. Non-ecological extras (likelihood, observation-error specification, positivity enforcement) are present but not counted as ecological components.",
