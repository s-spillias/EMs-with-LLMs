Assessment:
1. The current model structure is appropriate for fitting to time series of COTS and coral cover, but the resource limitation on COTS recruitment is oversimplified.
2. The model sums fast and slow coral cover for COTS carrying capacity, but COTS outbreaks are ecologically known to be triggered and sustained primarily by the abundance of fast-growing Acropora (fast coral).
3. This may limit the model's ability to accurately capture the timing and magnitude of outbreak events, especially the boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS dynamics.

Improvement:
I will refine the resource limitation mechanism by making COTS carrying capacity more sensitive to the abundance of fast coral, using a non-linear (Hill-type) function of fast coral cover. This better reflects the ecological reality that COTS outbreaks are triggered and sustained by fast coral, and that slow coral alone does not support large COTS populations. This change is justified by strong ecological evidence for selective predation and outbreak triggers, and should improve the model's ability to predict outbreak timing and magnitude.
