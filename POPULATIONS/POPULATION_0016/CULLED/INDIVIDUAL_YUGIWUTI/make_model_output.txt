You are a leading expert in constructing dynamic ecosystem models. You always use robust ecological theory to construct your models, which will be used for predicting future ecosystem states given data on initial conditions. Please create a Template Model Builder model for the following topic:Modeling episodic outbreaks of Crown of Thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef, with emphasis on accurately capturing the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model should predict the characteristic boom-bust cycles where COTS numbers rapidly increase to outbreak levels then decline, while accounting for their selective predation on coral communities (slow-growing Faviidae and Porites, and fast-growing Acropora species). Special attention should be given to mechanisms that trigger and sustain outbreak events.. Start by writing intention.txt, in which you provide a concise summary of the ecological functioning of the model. In model.cpp, write your TMB model with the following important considerations:

1. ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES:
- Consider multiple forms of resource limitation (e.g., saturating functions, threshold effects)
- Include process-specific efficiencies where biologically relevant
- Think about how environmental conditions might modify rates
- Consider indirect effects and feedback loops between components
- Use functional responses that capture observed biological behaviors

2. NUMERICAL STABILITY:
- Always use small constants (e.g., Type(1e-8)) to prevent division by zero
- Use smooth transitions instead of hard cutoffs in equations
- Bound parameters within biologically meaningful ranges using smooth penalties rather than hard constraints

3. LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION:
- Always include observations in the likelihood calculation, don't skip any based on conditions
- Use fixed minimum standard deviations to prevent numerical issues when data values are small
- Consider log-transforming data if it spans multiple orders of magnitude
- Use appropriate error distributions (e.g., lognormal for strictly positive data)

4. MODEL STRUCTURE:
- Include comments after each line explaining the parameters (including their units and how to determine their values)
- Provide a numbered list of descriptions for the equations
- Ensure all _pred variables are included in the reporting section and called using REPORT()
- Use '_pred' suffix for model predictions corresponding to '_dat' observations. Use the same _dat names as are found in the data file. Use the exact same time variable name as is provided in the first column of the datafile.
- IMPORTANT: Never use current time step values of response variables (variables ending in '_dat') in prediction calculations. Only use values from previous time steps to avoid data leakage.

For the parameters.json file, please structure it as an array of parameter objects, where each parameter object must include the following fields:
- parameter: The name of the parameter matching the model.cpp
- value: The initial value for the parameter
- description: A clear description of what the parameter represents, including units
- source: Where the initial value comes from (e.g., 'literature', 'expert opinion', 'initial estimate')
- import_type: Should be 'PARAMETER' for model parameters, or 'DATA_VECTOR'/'DATA_SCALAR' for data inputs
- priority: A number indicating the optimization priority (1 for highest priority parameters to optimize first)
Example structure:
{
  "parameters": [
    {
      "parameter": "growth_rate",
      "value": 0.5,
      "description": "Intrinsic growth rate (year^-1)",
      "source": "literature",
      "import_type": "PARAMETER",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]

 This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their interactions with two coral functional groups: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. The model is designed to capture the episodic, boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS populations,       
 including the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks.

 - Density-dependent COTS recruitment and mortality, with outbreak triggers linked to environmental drivers (e.g., larval immigration, temperature).

 The model avoids data leakage by using only lagged (previous time step) values of state variables for predictions. All predictions are compared to observed data using appropriate likelihoods, with robust handling of small values and parameter bounds. The model is intended for scenario exploration and forecasting of COTS outbreaks and coral community trajectories under    
 varying environmental and management conditions.

**************************************************

Based on the search results, the key points regarding the population recruitment potential and growth dynamics of the Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster spp.) are:

1. Periodic population outbreaks: The search results indicate that the Crown-of-Thorns starfish (CoTS) population experiences periodic outbreaks, with a cycle of 14-17 years observed in the past (Babcock et al., 2016). This suggests that a new wave of population irruptions is expected to commence in the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in the near future.

2. Rapid growth and recruitment potential: The ability of juvenile CoTS to exhibit rapid growth compared to other sympatric sea stars is likely to increase their recruitment into adult populations and lead to outbreaks (Pratchett et al., 2014). This rapid growth dynamic contributes to the potential for population explosions.

3. Monitoring and projections: Efforts are being made to advance projections of CoTS populations to support management and conservation strategies (Babcock et al., 2016). This includes tracking the total number of CoTS observations, both current and from past monitoring programs, to better understand the population dynamics and potential for outbreaks.

Asking claude
After carefully reviewing the search results, I cannot find a specific numerical value for the log intrinsic COTS recruitment rate (log(year^-1)). 

While the search results discuss COTS population dynamics, recruitment potential, and periodic outbreaks, they do not provide a precise quantitative value for the intrinsic recruitment rate.

Therefore, my response is:

Search results found for log_m_cots
**************************************************

Based on the search results, the annual mortality rate for Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) population dynamics can be summarized as follows:

Small juvenile Crown-of-Thorns starfish (3 mm in diameter) have a high mortality rate of 2.6% per day (Pratchett et al., 2017). This high mortality rate is largely attributed to predation by mobile predators, which account for 73% of the mortality (Pratchett et al., 2017).

In contrast, larger juvenile Crown-of-Thorns starfish (13 mm in diameter) have a lower mortality rate of 0.82% per day (Pratchett et al., 2017). The search results indicate that there were no significant differences in mortality rates between different sites (Pratchett et al., 2017).

Additionally, a study by Hock et al. (2014) found that incorporating zone-specific Crown-of-Thorns starfish mortality rates into their projections reduced severe underpredictions from 7.1% to 5.6%, which is critical for managers to accurately predict and manage outbreaks.

In summary, the annual mortality rates for Crown-of-Thorns starfish vary based on their size, with smaller juveniles (3 mm) experiencing much higher mortality rates (2.6% per day) compared to larger juveniles (13 mm) at 0.82% per day. Incorporating these size-specific mortality rates into population models is important for improving the accuracy of outbreak predictions.

Let's analyze the mortality rates and convert them to the appropriate units.

The search results provide daily mortality rates for different sizes of Crown-of-Thorns starfish:
- 3 mm juveniles: 2.6% per day
- 13 mm juveniles: 0.82% per day

To convert daily rates to annual log mortality rate (log(year^-1)):

For 3 mm juveniles:
- Daily rate: 0.026
- Annual rate: 1 - (1 - 0.026)^365 = 0.9999 or 99.99%
- Log mortality rate: log(0.9999) = -0.0001

For 13 mm juveniles:
- Daily rate: 0.0082
- Annual rate: 1 - (1 - 0.0082)^365 = 0.9726 or 97.26%
- Log mortality rate: log(0.9726) = -0.0279

Calculating the average:
- Min: -0.0279
- Max: -0.0001
- Value: (-0.0001 + -0.0279) / 2 = -0.014

Response:
{"min": -0.0279, "max": -0.0001, "value": -0.014}

Search results found for log_r_fast
**************************************************

According to the search results, fast-growing branching Acropora coral species can grow at rates up to 20 cm per year (HKBIH - Corals). These Acropora corals are primarily found in the eastern and northeastern waters, often associated with well-established coral communities in shallow water (HKBIH - Corals).

The study "Variation in growth rates of branching corals along Australia's Great Barrier Reef" found that temperature has a significant influence on the spatiotemporal patterns of branching coral growth (Cantin et al., 2010). This suggests that environmental factors like temperature can impact the growth rates of these fast-growing Acropora species.

Additionally, the article "Reef accretion and coral growth rates are decoupled in Holocene reef frameworks" notes that fast-growing branching corals from the Acroporidae and Pocilloporidae families are capable of extending over 100 cm per year (Cramer et al., 2020). This further supports the high growth rates observed in these Acropora coral species.

In summary, the search results indicate that fast-growing branching Acropora coral species can grow at rates up to 20 cm per year, with environmental factors like temperature playing a significant role in their growth patterns (HKBIH - Corals; Cantin et al., 2010; Cramer et al., 2020).

To convert the coral growth rate to log(%/year), I'll:
1. Use the given growth rates of 20 cm/year
2. Convert to percentage growth
3. Take the logarithm

Calculation:
- Growth rate: 20 cm/year
- Assuming coral diameter/volume relates to growth
- Percentage growth ≈ (20 cm / initial size) * 100%
- Assuming initial size of 10 cm, percentage growth = (20/10) * 100% = 200%
- Log(200%) = log(2) = 0.30

Therefore, the JSON response would be:

{"min": 0.2, "max": 0.4, "value": 0.30}

Key points:
- Converted linear growth rate to percentage growth
- Took logarithm of percentage
- Provided a range to account for variability in initial size and growth conditions
- Used log base 10 as typically expected in scientific notation

**************************************************

According to the search results, slow-growing massive coral reef species typically have growth rates ranging from 0.5 cm to 2 cm per year (NOAA CoRIS). However, under favorable conditions such as high light exposure, consistent temperature, and moderate wave action, some species can grow up to 4.5 cm per year (NOAA CoRIS).

The slow growth rate of massive corals has been a limiting factor in their use for restoration efforts (Microfragmenting for the successful restoration of slow growing...). Additionally, the accretion of Holocene reef frameworks is not directly related to the growth rate of the living corals, as modern Pacific corals have been shown to vary in growth rate by up to 10-fold (Reef accretion and coral growth rates are decoupled in Holocene...).

In summary, the growth rates of slow-growing massive coral reef species typically range from 0.5 cm to 2 cm per year, but can reach up to 4.5 cm per year under optimal conditions. This slow growth rate has been a challenge for coral restoration efforts.

To convert the coral growth rates to log(%/year), I'll:
1. Take the growth rates (0.5 to 4.5 cm/year)
2. Convert to % growth per year
3. Take the log of those values

- Min: (0.5 cm/year / 100 cm) * 100% = 0.5%/year
- Max: (4.5 cm/year / 100 cm) * 100% = 4.5%/year
- Average: (0.5 + 4.5) / 2 = 2.5%/year

Log transformation:
- Min log: log(0.5) = -0.30
- Max log: log(4.5) = 0.65
- Average log: log(2.5) = 0.40
