This model simulates the population dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef, with explicit representation of their interactions with two coral functional groups: fast-growing Acropora spp. and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites spp. The model is designed to capture the episodic, boom-bust cycles characteristic of COTS populations, including the timing, magnitude, and duration of outbreaks. 

Key ecological processes include:
- Density-dependent COTS recruitment and mortality, with outbreak triggers linked to environmental drivers (e.g., larval immigration, temperature).
- Resource limitation via saturating (Michaelis-Menten) functional responses for COTS predation on corals, with process-specific efficiencies.
- Feedbacks between COTS abundance and coral cover, including selective predation (preference for Acropora).
- Environmental modification of rates (e.g., temperature effects on COTS survival and coral growth).
- Indirect effects such as coral recovery following COTS decline.

The model avoids data leakage by using only lagged (previous time step) values of state variables for predictions. All predictions are compared to observed data using appropriate likelihoods, with robust handling of small values and parameter bounds. The model is intended for scenario exploration and forecasting of COTS outbreaks and coral community trajectories under varying environmental and management conditions.
