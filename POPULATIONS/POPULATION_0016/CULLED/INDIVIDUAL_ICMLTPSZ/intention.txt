This model simulates episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents interactions between adult COTS, fast-growing Acropora corals, and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites corals. COTS predation reduces coral cover, with selectivity for fast-growing species. Outbreaks are triggered and sustained by a combination of resource availability (coral cover), larval immigration, and environmental conditions (e.g., sea-surface temperature). Resource limitation is modeled using saturating and threshold functions, and feedbacks include coral recovery and COTS-induced coral mortality. The model incorporates process-specific efficiencies, environmental modifiers, and smooth transitions to ensure numerical stability. Predictions are made for each state variable at each time step, with likelihoods calculated using lognormal errors to account for the positive, right-skewed nature of abundance and cover data. All predictions are based solely on previous time step values to avoid data leakage.
