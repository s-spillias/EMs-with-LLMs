This model simulates the dynamics of a simple marine plankton food web, consisting of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z). The core interactions are:
1. Phytoplankton growth is limited by the availability of nutrients, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
2. Zooplankton preys on phytoplankton, described by a Holling Type II functional response.
3. Mortality affects both phytoplankton (density-dependent quadratic loss) and zooplankton (linear loss).
4. Nutrients are recycled back into the system through the mortality of both plankton groups, zooplankton excretion, and inefficient grazing by zooplankton.

The model is structured as a system of ordinary differential equations solved over time to predict the concentrations of N, P, and Z.
