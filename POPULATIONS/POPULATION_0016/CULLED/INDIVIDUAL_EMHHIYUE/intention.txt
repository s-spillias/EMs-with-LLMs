Assessment:
- The current model captures the general boom-bust dynamics of COTS and their impact on coral cover, including feedbacks and environmental drivers.
- However, the outbreak trigger is modeled as a smooth sigmoid, which may not adequately represent the abrupt, nonlinear onset of COTS outbreaks observed in nature.
- Key ecological process missing/oversimplified: The sharpness of the outbreak threshold. Real outbreaks often occur rapidly once coral cover exceeds a critical value, suggesting a need for a steeper, more nonlinear outbreak trigger.

Chosen improvement:
- Replace the current outbreak_mod sigmoid with a higher-order (sharper) sigmoid function, introducing a new parameter controlling the steepness ("sharpness") of the outbreak threshold.
- This will allow the model to better capture the timing and abruptness of outbreak events, improving fit to observed boom-bust cycles without introducing data leakage or excessive complexity.

Implementation:
- Add parameter log_outbreak_sharpness to parameters.json, with ecological justification.
- In model.cpp, replace the hard-coded sigmoid steepness (currently 5) with exp(log_outbreak_sharpness).
- Document all changes and rationale.
