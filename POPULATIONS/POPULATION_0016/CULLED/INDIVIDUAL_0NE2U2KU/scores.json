  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes but with several structural differences from the TRUTH Python model. Phytoplankton growth is driven by a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (instead of TRUTH's two-factor nutrient\u00d7light-like limitation). Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type III (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) matching TRUTH's functional form (parameter names differ). Recycling to nutrients in the candidate is split among unassimilated grazing, explicit excretion, and an added remineralization of dead organic matter; TRUTH uses a different recycling parameterization (terms involving beta*lambda_, gamma*q, r*P). The candidate adds quadratic mortality terms and an explicit remineralization term that are not in TRUTH. Important omissions relative to TRUTH: no explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for N, P or Z, and no explicit light limitation term in the phytoplankton growth formulation. Numerical solution differences (explicit Euler stepping in candidate vs RK45 in TRUTH) and different initialisation/observation treatment may also affect dynamics.",
