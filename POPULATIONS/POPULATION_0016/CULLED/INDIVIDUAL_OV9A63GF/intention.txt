Assessment:
- The current model captures key processes: COTS predation, resource limitation, environmental drivers, and positive feedbacks.
- However, the outbreak onset is controlled by a fixed-steepness sigmoid on total coral cover, which may not be flexible enough to capture the abrupt, episodic nature of real COTS outbreaks.
- Ecological studies suggest outbreaks are often triggered when coral cover exceeds a critical threshold, with the sharpness of this transition varying between systems.

Improvement:
- Add a new parameter, `log_outbreak_steepness`, to control the steepness of the outbreak threshold sigmoid in COTS recruitment.
- This allows the model to fit sharper or smoother outbreak transitions as required by the data, improving its ability to reproduce the timing and magnitude of boom-bust cycles.
- Ecological justification: Outbreaks are often abrupt and threshold-driven; allowing the steepness to be estimated increases realism and flexibility.
