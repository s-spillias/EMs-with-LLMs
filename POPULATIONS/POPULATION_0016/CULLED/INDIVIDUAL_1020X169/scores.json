  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with all three state variables and the major fluxes (uptake, grazing, recycling, and mixing for nutrients). Where it differs from the TRUTH Python NPZ is mostly in the functional-form choices: the candidate uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake (N/(K+N)) rather than the two-factor N * light-like limitation in TRUTH, uses a Holling type III grazing that is structurally equivalent to TRUTH, and replaces TRUTH's linear zooplankton mortality with quadratic (density-dependent) mortality. The candidate also explicitly remobilizes mortality (remineralization from both P and Z) and includes both linear and quadratic phytoplankton mortality. Numerically it uses explicit Euler stepping (discrete) and lognormal observation errors for fitting (non-ecological model machinery). Overall: same ecological roles present, but some functional forms differ (mix of TRUTH_MATCH and ALTERNATE), and a few additional mortality/recycling terms are introduced.",
