  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling and nutrient mixing present. Key matches: Holling-type III grazing and assimilation map closely to the TRUTH formulation and the nutrient mixing term is the same linear entrainment form. Main differences: phytoplankton uptake is implemented as a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten form (no explicit light/self-shading factor present in TRUTH), phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality include additional quadratic (density-dependent) terms, and the candidate adds an explicit detritus (D) pool with remineralization. The candidate also omits an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking term present in TRUTH and does not include an explicit zooplankton mixing term (TRUTH also lacks zooplankton mixing).",
