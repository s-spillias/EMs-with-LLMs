  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the major NPZ processes (nutrient uptake, grazing, mortality, recycling) using standard functional forms. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited growth (no separate light/biomass limitation term present). Grazing is Holling-type III (P^2/(K^2+P^2)) and matches the TRUTH functional form. Phytoplankton mortality is linear as in TRUTH; zooplankton growth is assimilation of grazing as in TRUTH. Key differences: the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and for plankton that exists in the TRUTH model (k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P), and zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) rather than TRUTH\u2019s linear loss. Recycling is present but parameterized differently (explicit unassimilated grazing + excretion + a lumped remineralization term). Overall the candidate uses alternates for uptake and zooplankton mortality and matches TRUTH for grazing, phytoplankton mortality, and assimilated grazing structure.",
