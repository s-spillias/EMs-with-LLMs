Assessment:
- The current model captures the main feedbacks between COTS and coral, including selective predation and environmental modulation of outbreaks.
- However, it oversimplifies coral community dynamics by allowing fast and slow coral to regrow independently, which can result in total coral cover exceeding ecological limits (e.g., >100% substrate cover).
- This misses a key ecological process: competition for space between coral groups, which is critical for realistic outbreak dynamics and coral recovery.

Improvement:
- I will implement explicit space competition between fast and slow corals by introducing a shared carrying capacity (K_total) for total coral cover.
- This ensures that the sum of fast and slow coral cover cannot exceed the available substrate (e.g., 100%), making the model more ecologically realistic and improving the timing/magnitude of COTS outbreaks.
- A new parameter (log_K_total) will be added to control the maximum total coral cover.
- This change is justified because coral species compete for limited space, and this competition shapes both coral recovery and the conditions that trigger/sustain COTS outbreaks.
