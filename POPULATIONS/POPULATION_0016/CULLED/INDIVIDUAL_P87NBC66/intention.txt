Assessment of Current Model:
1. Model Fit: The model uses lognormal likelihoods and reports predictions for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here. The structure is appropriate for time series fitting, but the fit quality should be checked with residuals.
2. Addressing Project Context: The model captures the boom-bust dynamics of COTS and their predation on coral, with feedbacks between COTS and coral cover. Outbreaks are triggered by a flexible coral cover threshold, and environmental drivers (SST, larval immigration) modulate recruitment. However, the model assumes that COTS predation rates on corals are constant (per capita), and does not account for possible non-linearities in predation efficiency at high or low coral cover.
3. Missing/Oversimplified Processes: A key ecological process that may be oversimplified is the functional response of COTS predation on coral. The current model uses a Type II (hyperbolic) functional response, but does not allow for possible predator satiation or interference at high COTS densities, which could dampen outbreak peaks and better capture bust phases.

Chosen Improvement:
I will introduce a density-dependent predation efficiency term (i.e., a non-linear, saturating effect of COTS density on their per capita predation rate on coral). This reflects that at high COTS densities, interference or satiation may reduce the per capita impact on coral, which is ecologically plausible and can help the model better capture the decline phase of outbreaks and avoid unrealistically high coral mortality during peaks.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter "log_gamma_pred" (log COTS interference/satiation parameter) to parameters.json, with ecological justification.
- In model.cpp, modify the predation terms (pred_fast and pred_slow) to include a denominator (1 + gamma_pred * cots_prev), representing reduced per capita predation at high COTS densities.
- This change is justified as it introduces a higher-order, non-linear feedback that is well-supported in predator-prey theory and is likely to improve the realism of outbreak dynamics.
