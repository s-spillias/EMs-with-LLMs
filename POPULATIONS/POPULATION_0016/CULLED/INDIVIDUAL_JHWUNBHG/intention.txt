Assessment:
- The current model captures the general feedbacks between COTS and coral, but the outbreak recruitment function uses a simple Michaelis-Menten (saturating) response to coral cover.
- This may not generate the sharp, threshold-like COTS outbreaks observed in the field, potentially underestimating the abruptness and magnitude of population explosions.
- Outbreaks in nature often occur only when coral cover exceeds a critical threshold, leading to rapid COTS population increases.

Ecological improvement:
- Replace the simple Michaelis-Menten outbreak modifier with a Hill function (higher-order saturating response) to coral cover.
- This introduces a "switch-like" nonlinearity, allowing for sharper, more realistic outbreak onsets and collapses.
- The Hill exponent (>1) controls the abruptness of the outbreak threshold, and is ecologically justified for systems with strong positive feedbacks or cooperative processes in recruitment.

Implementation:
- Add a new parameter "hill_exp" (Hill exponent) to parameters.json.
- Update the outbreak modifier in model.cpp to use the Hill function:
    outbreak_mod = pow(coral_sum, hill_exp) / (pow(K_outbreak, hill_exp) + pow(coral_sum, hill_exp))
- This change should improve the model's ability to reproduce the timing and magnitude of COTS outbreaks, as required by the project context.
