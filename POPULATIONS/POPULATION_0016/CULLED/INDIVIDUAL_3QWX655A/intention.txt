Assessment:
- The current model captures the main boom-bust dynamics of COTS outbreaks and includes feedbacks between COTS and coral, environmental drivers (SST, larval immigration), and a flexible outbreak threshold.
- However, it does not include direct competition between fast and slow coral for space, which is ecologically important on real reefs and may help explain residual patterns (e.g., overestimation of coral recovery or failure to capture shifts in coral composition).

Chosen improvement:
- Add a symmetric interspecific competition term between fast and slow coral in the logistic growth equations. This will allow the model to better capture competitive exclusion and resource limitation, improving predictions of coral community dynamics during and after COTS outbreaks.

Justification:
- Fast-growing Acropora and slow-growing massive corals compete for limited substrate. Including competition is ecologically realistic and may improve model fit and interpretability, especially for the timing and magnitude of coral recovery phases.
