This model simulates the dynamics of a simplified marine planktonic ecosystem, comprising three key components: Nutrients (N), Phytoplankton (P), and Zooplankton (Z). The model captures the fundamental processes governing the flow of energy and matter through the lower trophic levels of the oceanic mixed layer.

The core interactions are as follows:
1.  **Nutrient Uptake:** Phytoplankton consume dissolved nutrients from the water column for growth. This process is dependent on both nutrient availability and phytoplankton biomass.
2.  **Grazing:** Zooplankton consume phytoplankton as their primary food source. This predation pressure controls the phytoplankton population.
3.  **Nutrient Regeneration:** Nutrients are returned to the system through two main pathways: the mortality of both phytoplankton and zooplankton, and the excretion of waste products by zooplankton during grazing (sloppy eating).

This formulation creates a closed-loop system where nutrients are cycled from an inorganic state (N) to organic matter (P and Z) and back again, driving the characteristic boom-and-bust cycles often observed in plankton populations.
