This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between adult COTS, fast-growing corals (Acropora spp.), and slow-growing corals (Faviidae and Porites spp.), capturing selective predation by COTS on these coral groups. Outbreaks are triggered and sustained by a combination of larval immigration, resource availability, and environmental conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature), with feedbacks between COTS abundance and coral cover. Resource limitation is modeled using saturating and threshold functions, and process-specific efficiencies are included for predation and coral recovery. Environmental modifiers affect COTS recruitment and coral growth. The model avoids data leakage by only using lagged (previous time step) values of state variables for predictions. All predictions are compared to observed data using appropriate likelihoods, with robust handling of small values and parameter bounds. This framework enables robust prediction of future COTS outbreaks and coral community trajectories under varying environmental and management scenarios.
