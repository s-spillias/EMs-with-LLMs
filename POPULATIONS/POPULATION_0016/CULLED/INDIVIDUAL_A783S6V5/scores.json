  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements most standard NPZ processes but uses different mathematical choices and routing compared with the TRUTH model. Uptake is a canonical Michaelis\u2013Menten formulation rather than TRUTH's multiplicative nutrient\u00d7light term. Grazing is the same Holling type\u2011III functional form as TRUTH and zooplankton growth is implemented as assimilated grazing (matching TRUTH structurally). Recycling is present but routed through an explicit detritus pool (with remineralization and sinking) rather than immediate direct recycling to nutrients as in TRUTH. Explicit mixing/entrainment terms for N, P or Z (e.g. k*(N0-N) or (s+k)*P) are absent in the candidate.",
