Assessment:
- The current model captures the main boom-bust dynamics of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) and their impact on coral communities, using logistic growth, predation, and environmental drivers.
- However, the effect of coral cover on COTS carrying capacity is modeled as a linear function, which may not reflect the saturating nature of resource limitation in real ecosystems.
- This linearity could lead to overestimation of COTS densities at high coral cover and may not accurately capture the observed outbreak peaks and busts.

Ecological improvement:
- I am introducing a saturating (Michaelis-Menten) function for the effect of total coral cover on COTS carrying capacity.
- This change allows COTS carrying capacity to increase rapidly with coral cover at low levels, but approach an asymptote at high coral cover, reflecting diminishing returns and more realistic resource limitation.
- This should improve the model's ability to reproduce the timing, magnitude, and duration of COTS outbreaks, and prevent unrealistically high COTS densities when coral is abundant.

Implementation:
- Added parameter: log_K_coral_half (log half-saturation constant for coral effect on COTS K).
- In model.cpp, K_cots_eff is now calculated as:
    K_cots_eff = K_cots * (coral_sum / (K_coral_half + coral_sum + eps));
- This change is ecologically justified as it better represents the non-linear relationship between resource (coral) availability and consumer (COTS) population growth.
