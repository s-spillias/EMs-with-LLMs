  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical ecological roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing, recycling, mortality, zooplankton growth via assimilation) but generally using simpler/alternative functional forms than the TRUTH Python model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited form rather than the TRUTH's additional P-dependent light limitation (a/(b + c*P)). Grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate versus a Type III\u2013like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) in TRUTH. Recycling is present (unassimilated grazing, excretion, remineralization) but not via the same coefficients/functional forms. The candidate omits explicit environmental mixing/entrainment terms for N, P, and Z that appear in TRUTH (k*(N0 - N) and mixing-related losses), and it adds a quadratic zooplankton mortality term not present in TRUTH. The candidate also embeds an observation/likelihood model (lognormal errors) and soft parameter penalties for estimation (not ecological processes).",
