  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ interactions but with several structural differences from the TRUTH model. Phytoplankton uptake in the candidate is implemented as a standard Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH product form that combines nutrient limitation and a P-dependent light/self-shading term (N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) * P). Grazing is implemented as a Holling-type III (P^2/(K_P^2+P^2) * Z) and matches the TRUTH functional form (same P^2/(mu^2+P^2) dependence). Phytoplankton linear mortality and zooplankton assimilated grazing (assimilation efficiency * grazing) are present and correspond closely to TRUTH. Key differences: the candidate lacks the TRUTH environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients and phytoplankton, includes a continuous excretion term proportional to Z (excretion = gamma*Z) and a quadratic zooplankton mortality (m_Z * Z^2) rather than TRUTH's linear zooplankton mortality. Remineralization in the candidate bundles phytoplankton and zooplankton mortalities into a single epsilon*(p_mortality + z_mortality) term feeding N. Numerically, the candidate uses an explicit Euler time-stepping solver and includes observation and penalty structures (non-ecological).",
