  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements most canonical ecological processes present in a NPZ model but not always in the same mathematical form as the TRUTH reference. Phytoplankton uptake is represented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten term (no explicit light limitation factor), grazing is Holling type\u2011III and matches the TRUTH functional form, and zooplankton growth uses an assimilation efficiency applied to the same Holling\u2011III grazing. The candidate adds explicit quadratic mortality terms and an explicit remineralization term that are not in the TRUTH model. Important omissions relative to TRUTH are an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient equation (k*(N0-N)) and explicit physical mixing losses for P and Z.",
