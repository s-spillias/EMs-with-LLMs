  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the standard three-compartment structure (N, P, Z) with uptake, grazing, recycling, and physical supply represented, but uses alternate functional forms in several places relative to the TRUTH Python model. Uptake is implemented as a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten (N-limitation) times P, whereas the TRUTH model multiplies N-limitation by an additional a/(b+c*P) term (interpretable as light/self-shading). Grazing is Holling-type III with an explicit refuge (P_ref) in the candidate vs. a Holling-type III-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) in TRUTH. Recycling in the candidate is decomposed into unassimilated grazing, excretion, and an explicit remineralization term; TRUTH routes recycling through particular parameter combinations (beta*lambda_..., gamma*q*Z). Physical mixing of nutrients (N0 - N) is implemented identically (same mathematical form). Several extra process terms appear in the candidate (refuge threshold, quadratic P- and Z-mortality, explicit remineralization), and the candidate omits explicit physical loss (mixing/sinking) for P and Z that appear in/are represented in TRUTH's formulation for P (TRUTH has -(s + k)*P). Overall the candidate matches the TRUTH model in structure but differs by using alternate (and in some cases additional) mechanisms for grazing, mortality and recycling.",
