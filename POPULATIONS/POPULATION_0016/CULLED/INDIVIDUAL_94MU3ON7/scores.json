  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure but differs from the TRUTH model in several important ways. It uses a Michaelis\u2013Menten style nutrient uptake (multiplicative with P) and a Holling-Type-III (sigmoidal P^2/(K^2+P^2)) grazing that is algebraically equivalent to the TRUTH grazing. Zooplankton growth is grazing-based with an assimilation efficiency (matching TRUTH in role). The candidate explicitly routes mortality into a detritus pool and returns nutrients via detritus remineralization, which is not present in the TRUTH formulation. The candidate also includes linear+quadratic mortality terms and an explicit excretion term; it omits the environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH (k*(N0-N) for nutrients and the mixing term in P). Overall: core predator\u2013prey (grazing/assimilation) terms are present and grazing matches TRUTH exactly; uptake, recycling, and mortality follow commonly used alternates and an explicit detritus pool is an extra process; mixing terms from TRUTH are mostly absent.",
