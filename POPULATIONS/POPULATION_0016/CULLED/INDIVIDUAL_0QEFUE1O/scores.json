  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core ecological roles (nutrient uptake, grazing, assimilation, mortality, recycling) but uses alternate mathematical forms relative to the TRUTH Python model. Uptake is implemented as classical Michaelis\u2013Menten (N/(K+N))*P rather than TRUTH's N/(e+N) times a P-dependent term a/(b+cP). Grazing is Holling type II (P/(K_P+P)*Z) vs TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2)*Z functional form. The candidate explicitly includes linear plus quadratic mortality for both P and Z and an explicit remineralization term that returns mortality losses to N. The candidate lacks explicit environmental mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton (e.g., TRUTH's k*(N0-N) and (s+k)*P), and it omits explicit mixing for zooplankton as well. Overall, the candidate matches the ecological roles but primarily via alternate, commonly used formulations (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling II grazing, assimilation efficiency), and adds explicit quadratic mortality and remineralization processes not in TRUTH.",
