  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the same core NPZ processes as the TRUTH model (nutrient uptake with light limitation, Holling type-III grazing with assimilation, recycling/excretion, and mixing of nutrients). Several terms match the TRUTH structure exactly (Holling III grazing, nutrient mixing, linear phytoplankton mortality, assimilated grazing \u2192 Z growth). Other terms are implemented as common alternates from the literature: the nutrient uptake light function differs in form, zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) rather than linear, and recycling/excretion/remineralization are parameterized differently. The candidate omits an explicit mixing loss for phytoplankton (P) that appears in TRUTH as a -k*P term (inside TRUTH's (s+k)*P). Numerical/estimation code (lognormal observation model, penalties, positivity clamps, Euler time stepping) is present but not counted as new ecological processes.",
