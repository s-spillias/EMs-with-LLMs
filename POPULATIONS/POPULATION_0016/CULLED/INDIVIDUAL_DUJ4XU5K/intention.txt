This model simulates the episodic outbreaks ("boom-bust" cycles) of Crown-of-Thorns starfish (COTS) on the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the timing, magnitude, and duration of population explosions. The model explicitly represents the interactions between adult COTS, fast-growing Acropora corals, and slow-growing Faviidae/Porites corals. COTS predation reduces coral cover, with selectivity for fast-growing species. Resource limitation is modeled via saturating and threshold functions, and environmental drivers (e.g., sea-surface temperature, larval immigration) modulate COTS recruitment and outbreak probability. Feedbacks include coral depletion reducing COTS carrying capacity and coral recovery following COTS decline. The model is designed for robust prediction of outbreak events and their ecosystem impacts, using likelihood-based inference with lognormal errors and careful attention to numerical stability and ecological realism.
