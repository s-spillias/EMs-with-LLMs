  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake by P, grazing by Z, recycling, and mixing) but uses simpler/alternate forms for some terms and adds an explicit detritus compartment and density-dependent mortalities. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are Michaelis\u2013Menten style (no explicit light-limitation factor present in TRUTH). Grazing is Holling type-III, matching the TRUTH functional form. Zooplankton growth is assimilated grazing (structurally equivalent). Candidate includes additional detritus dynamics and quadratic mortality terms that are not present in the TRUTH equations.",
