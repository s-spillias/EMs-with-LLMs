Assessment of Current Model:

1. Model Fit to Data:
- The model uses lognormal likelihoods for COTS, fast coral, and slow coral, with observation error parameters. However, without the residuals file, direct assessment of fit is not possible here. The structure is appropriate for time series, but the fit should be checked for systematic bias, autocorrelation, or inability to capture outbreak peaks and busts.

2. Addressing Project Context:
- The model captures key features: COTS population booms (via logistic growth modulated by SST and immigration), predation on both fast and slow corals, and feedbacks where coral depletion limits COTS. Outbreaks are triggered by a smooth threshold on coral cover.
- Environmental drivers (SST, larval immigration) are included.
- Resource limitation is present via coral-dependent COTS carrying capacity.
- However, the model may oversimplify the feedback from coral depletion to COTS decline, and the outbreak threshold is a simple sigmoid.

3. Missing or Oversimplified Processes:
- The model assumes COTS recruitment is a smooth function of coral cover, but does not explicitly account for possible non-linear or saturating effects of coral availability on COTS recruitment or survival.
- It does not include density-dependent predation efficiency or variable predation rates as coral cover changes.
- There is no explicit representation of coral-algal competition, which can affect coral recovery post-outbreak.
- The outbreak threshold is a simple sigmoid, which may not capture the sharpness or delay of real-world outbreaks.

Chosen Improvement: 
**Introduce a saturating (Michaelis-Menten type) functional response for COTS recruitment as a function of coral cover.**
- Ecological Justification: In reality, COTS recruitment and outbreak potential may saturate at high coral cover, due to limits in larval settlement, food handling, or behavioral aggregation. This non-linear response can better capture the rapid onset and abrupt decline of outbreaks, and prevent unrealistically high COTS recruitment at very high coral cover.
- Mathematical Form: Replace the current outbreak_mod (sigmoid) with a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) function of total coral cover: outbreak_mod = coral_sum / (K_outbreak + coral_sum), where K_outbreak is a new parameter representing the coral cover at which COTS recruitment is half-maximal.
- This approach is simple, ecologically interpretable, and avoids data leakage.

Implementation:
- Add parameter log_K_outbreak to parameters.json.
- In model.cpp, replace the sigmoid outbreak_mod with the saturating function.
- Document the change and justification.
