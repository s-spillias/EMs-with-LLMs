  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the main canonical processes (nutrient uptake, grazing, recycling, mortality, mixing) but with several structural differences from the TRUTH python model. Uptake in the candidate is a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten (N/(K+N)) times P, whereas TRUTH multiplies nutrient saturation by a second factor a/(b + c P) (i.e. a P-dependent term). Grazing is implemented with the same Holling-type III P^2/(K^2+P^2) functional form as TRUTH (variable names differ). Recycling and excretion are present in the candidate but are organized differently (unassimilated grazing + explicit remineralization parameter) compared with the TRUTH terms. The candidate also adds quadratic mortality terms and an explicit zooplankton washout term that do not appear in the TRUTH equations. Overall the candidate matches several canonical families (Michaelis-Menten uptake, Holling type-III grazing, linear washout) but uses alternates for mortality and recycling and includes a few extra processes relative to TRUTH.",
