  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, a Holling-type III grazing function, assimilation to zooplankton, and mortality/recycling pathways. Many ecological roles in the TRUTH model are present but several formulations differ: uptake in the candidate lacks the TRUTH model's additional light-dependent factor a/(b + c P), the candidate lumps remineralization of dead biomass via an explicit epsilon parameter and returns excretion independently of mortality, and it adds a quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Some TRUTH terms (explicit mixing/entrainment terms for N and P, and the TRUTH-style mixing term in P) are not present in the candidate. Overall the candidate is consistent with common alternate formulations in the literature (Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake, Holling type III grazing, linear mortality), with one clear extra process (quadratic zooplankton mortality) plus an explicit excretion formulation differing from TRUTH.",
