  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure but uses simpler, classic functional forms compared to the TRUTH model. Uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by P (bilinear), whereas TRUTH uses a two-factor uptake: nutrient limitation N/(e+N) times a P-dependent light/size term a/(b + cP)*P. Grazing in the candidate is Holling type II (I_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) while TRUTH uses a sigmoidal (type III) P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form. The candidate includes linear mortality and explicit excretion/mortality recycling terms to N, but it does not include an explicit nutrient mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N)) present in TRUTH, nor an explicit phytoplankton mixing/sinking term. Overall, most canonical processes are present but several are implemented with alternate (simpler) formulations and the mixing term for nutrients is missing.",
