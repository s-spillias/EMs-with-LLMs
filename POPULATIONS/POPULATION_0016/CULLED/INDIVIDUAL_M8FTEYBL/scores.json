  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ fluxes (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, Holling-type III grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, and mortalities) and maps them to observation likelihoods. Many process families match the TRUTH model or standard alternates: nutrient uptake is Michaelis\u2013Menten, grazing is Holling Type III (same algebraic form as TRUTH), and zooplankton growth is grazing\u00d7assimilation. Differences: the candidate omits explicit physical mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH for N and P (and Z), represents mortality differently (adds quadratic mortality and channels dead matter through an explicit remineralization term epsilon), and uses a direct remineralization/excretion bookkeeping (sloppy feeding, excretion, remineralization) rather than the exact terms in TRUTH. Implementation uses an Euler forward discretization rather than continuous ODE integration (implementation detail).",
