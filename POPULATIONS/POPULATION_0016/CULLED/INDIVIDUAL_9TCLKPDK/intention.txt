Assessment:
- The current model captures key feedbacks and environmental drivers relevant to COTS outbreaks and coral dynamics.
- However, the outbreak threshold for COTS recruitment is hard-coded (sigmoid at coral_sum - 10), which may not reflect real-world variability in outbreak triggers.
- This rigidity could limit the model's ability to fit the timing and magnitude of observed outbreaks, as required by the project context.

Improvement:
- Introduce a new parameter, `outbreak_thresh`, representing the coral cover threshold at which COTS outbreaks are triggered.
- This parameter will be estimated from the data, allowing the model to flexibly capture site- or context-specific outbreak dynamics.
- Ecological justification: Outbreaks may be triggered at different coral cover levels depending on local conditions; a flexible threshold improves realism and fit.
- Implementation: Replace the hard-coded value in the outbreak_mod sigmoid with the new parameter.
