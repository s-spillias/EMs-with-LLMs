  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the same core NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth + mortality) but uses different functional forms in key places. Phytoplankton growth and nutrient uptake are implemented as simple Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient-limited uptake (V_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH model's multiplicative nutrient \u00d7 light-like term (N/(e+N) * a/(b + c P) * P). Grazing is Holling type II (I_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) instead of the TRUTH model's P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) (a Hill-type with exponent 2). The candidate includes recycling from unassimilated grazing and from mortalities returning to nutrients, but it lacks the explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term in the nutrient equation present in TRUTH. The candidate adds a quadratic zooplankton mortality term (m_Z2 * Z^2) that is not present in TRUTH. Numerical/estimation features (forward-Euler stepping, lognormal observation errors, parameter penalties) are present but are not ecological processes.",
