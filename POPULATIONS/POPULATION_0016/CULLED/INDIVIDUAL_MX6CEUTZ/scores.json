  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core trophic interactions (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, Holling type-III grazing, assimilation-driven zooplankton growth, and phytoplankton linear mortality) in ways that are directly comparable to the TRUTH model. The grazing functional form and the use of an assimilation efficiency to drive Z growth are essentially the same as TRUTH. However the candidate omits the TRUTH model's P-dependent light limitation factor (a/(b + c*P)) in the uptake term and it does not include an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for nutrients or phytoplankton. The candidate uses Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake (alternate to TRUTH's combined N\u2013and\u2013P dependent uptake/light term), implements zooplankton quadratic mortality (alternate to TRUTH's linear Z mortality), and adds an explicit continuous excretion term (gamma * Z) and an explicit remineralization of dead matter (epsilon*(p_mortality + z_mortality)). Numerically it uses forward Euler time stepping and enforces non-negativity; the TRUTH model uses continuous-time ODEs with RK45. Overall: core ecological roles present, grazing and assimilation match TRUTH closely, but uptake light-limitation and mixing terms are missing and some mortality/recycling choices differ.",

TRUTH used (N/(e+N))*(a/(b + c*P))*P which multiplies N-limitation with a P-dependent light/inhibition factor; the candidate lacks the P-dependent (a/(b+c*P)) light term, so it is an alternate (Michaelis\u2013Menten) formulation."
