Assessment:
- The current model captures the main feedbacks and drivers of COTS outbreaks, including logistic COTS growth, resource limitation by coral, environmental modulation (SST, immigration), and COTS predation on both fast and slow coral types.
- However, the model treats fast and slow coral regrowth as independent logistic processes, without explicit competition for space. In reality, these coral groups compete for limited substrate, and this competition can influence recovery rates and community composition after COTS outbreaks.

Improvement:
- I am adding explicit Lotka-Volterra competition terms to the logistic regrowth equations for both fast and slow coral. This will allow the model to capture the effects of interspecific competition on coral recovery, which is important for predicting the duration and magnitude of post-outbreak coral community shifts.
- Two new parameters are introduced: the effect of fast coral on slow coral regrowth, and vice versa. This approach is ecologically justified and adds minimal mathematical complexity while improving the model's ability to capture key system dynamics relevant to episodic COTS outbreaks.
