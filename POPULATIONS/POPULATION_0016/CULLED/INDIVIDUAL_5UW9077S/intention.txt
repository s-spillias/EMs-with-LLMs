Assessment:
- The current model captures key feedbacks and environmental drivers for COTS outbreaks, but the resource limitation on COTS (carrying capacity) is modeled as a linear function of total coral cover.
- Ecological evidence suggests that COTS carrying capacity should saturate at high coral cover due to behavioral and density-dependent constraints.
- The linear form may overestimate COTS population growth at high coral cover, potentially distorting the timing and magnitude of outbreaks.

Improvement:
- Replace the linear scaling of COTS carrying capacity with a saturating (Michaelis-Menten) function of total coral cover.
- Introduce a new parameter, K_cots_half, representing the coral cover at which COTS carrying capacity is half its maximum.
- This change better reflects the diminishing returns of coral availability for supporting COTS populations and should improve the model's ability to reproduce realistic boom-bust cycles.

Justification:
- The saturating function is ecologically justified and mathematically simple, avoids overfitting, and does not introduce data leakage.
- This modification is expected to improve the timing and magnitude of predicted COTS outbreaks, aligning the model more closely with observed dynamics.
