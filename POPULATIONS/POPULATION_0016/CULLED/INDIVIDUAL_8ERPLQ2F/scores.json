  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake and a Holling Type III grazing, and it routes grazing assimilation/unassimilated fractions and excretion back to nutrients. It differs from the TRUTH model in three main ways: (1) the candidate omits an explicit environmental mixing/entrainment term for N (k*(N0-N)) and does not include mixing losses for P or Z; (2) it uses quadratic mortality closures for P and Z (density-dependent losses) and an explicit remineralization term that recycles both P and Z mortalities to nutrients\u2014process forms not present in TRUTH; (3) some parameter/term names differ (e.g., V_max/K_N vs a/(b + c*P) factor in TRUTH), so several components match literature alternates rather than being exact algebraic matches to TRUTH. Numerically, the candidate uses an Euler time step and a statistical observation model (lognormal likelihood) which are modeling choices but not ecological processes.",
