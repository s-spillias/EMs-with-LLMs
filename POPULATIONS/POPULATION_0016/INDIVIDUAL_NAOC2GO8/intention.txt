Assessment:
- The current model captures key features of COTS-coral dynamics, including boom-bust cycles, resource limitation, environmental drivers, and selective predation.
- However, it assumes constant per capita COTS predation rates, regardless of COTS density.
- Ecological studies indicate that at high COTS densities, interference or intraspecific competition reduces per capita feeding efficiency, which can affect outbreak magnitude and duration.

Improvement:
- I will introduce a density-dependent predation efficiency term for COTS, so that per capita predation rates on corals decline at high COTS densities.
- This is implemented by multiplying the predation terms by exp(-gamma_cots * cots_prev), where gamma_cots >= 0 is a new parameter.
- This modification is ecologically justified and can help the model better capture the decline and duration of COTS outbreaks.
