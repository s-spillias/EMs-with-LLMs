  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, grazing with a Holling-type III functional response, assimilation to zooplankton, and recycling) but with several structural differences from the TRUTH model. Uptake is implemented as Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation multiplied by a self-shading term (1/(1+alpha*P)) rather than TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) light term. Grazing uses the same Holling type III P^2/(K^2+P^2) form as TRUTH, and phytoplankton linear mortality is present in both. Key differences: recycling of phytoplankton mortality is routed through an explicit detritus state with remineralization and sinking (a process/state not present in TRUTH), zooplankton mortality is quadratic (density-dependent) rather than linear, and there is no explicit physical mixing/entrainment term for nutrients/phytoplankton/zooplankton that matches TRUTH's k*(N0-N) or (s+k)*P. Overall the candidate matches many ecological roles but mixes alternate formulations (detritus pool, quadratic Z mortality, different light limitation, and different routing of mortality) rather than being algebraically identical to TRUTH.",
