MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
-------------------------
The model implements a comprehensive NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) system with:
- Seasonal light variation (sinusoidal with amplitude and phase parameters)
- Temperature dependence via Q10 formulation for growth, grazing, and remineralization
- Self-shading by phytoplankton
- Nutrient recycling from mortality and inefficient grazing
- Michaelis-Menten kinetics for nutrient uptake and grazing

STRENGTHS:
- Mechanistic representation of key processes
- Temperature sensitivity appropriately parameterized
- Seasonal forcing captures annual cycles
- Parameter values updated from literature with realistic bounds

IDENTIFIED GAP:
--------------
The model uses a CONSTANT zooplankton assimilation efficiency (epsilon = 0.3), which doesn't reflect the ecological reality that phytoplankton food quality varies with nutrient availability.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
-----------------------------------------
In natural plankton systems, phytoplankton elemental composition (C:N:P ratios) varies with nutrient availability:

1. NUTRIENT-REPLETE CONDITIONS:
   - Phytoplankton have balanced C:N ratios (Redfield ratio ~6.6:1 by mass)
   - High protein content, low carbohydrate storage
   - High nutritional value for zooplankton
   - Higher assimilation efficiency (epsilon → epsilon_max)

2. NUTRIENT-LIMITED CONDITIONS:
   - Phytoplankton accumulate carbon as carbohydrates/lipids
   - Elevated C:N ratios (can exceed 10:1 or higher)
   - Lower protein content
   - Lower nutritional value for zooplankton
   - Reduced assimilation efficiency (epsilon → epsilon_min)

This phenomenon, known as the "stoichiometric knife edge" or "light:nutrient hypothesis," has been extensively documented in plankton ecology literature (Sterner & Elser 2002, Ecological Stoichiometry; Urabe & Sterner 1996).

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
---------------------
Implement VARIABLE ASSIMILATION EFFICIENCY as a function of phytoplankton nutrient status:

epsilon(N,P) = epsilon_min + (epsilon_max - epsilon_min) * f_nutrient

where f_nutrient represents the nutritional quality of phytoplankton, approximated by the degree of nutrient limitation experienced during growth.

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
------------------------
Use the nutrient limitation factor (already calculated in the model) as a proxy for phytoplankton nutrient status:

nutrient_limitation = N / (K_N + N)

Then:
epsilon_effective = epsilon_min + (epsilon_max - epsilon_min) * nutrient_limitation

ECOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION:
- When N >> K_N: nutrient_limitation → 1, epsilon → epsilon_max (high quality food)
- When N << K_N: nutrient_limitation → 0, epsilon → epsilon_min (poor quality food)
- This creates a feedback: nutrient depletion reduces phytoplankton quality, which reduces zooplankton growth efficiency, which can allow phytoplankton recovery

PARAMETER CHANGES:
-----------------
REMOVE: epsilon (constant assimilation efficiency)

ADD:
- epsilon_min: Minimum assimilation efficiency under severe nutrient limitation
  * Typical value: 0.15-0.20 (zooplankton can only convert 15-20% of carbon-rich, protein-poor food)
  * Lower bound: 0.05 (some assimilation always occurs)
  * Upper bound: 0.40 (cannot exceed epsilon_max)

- epsilon_max: Maximum assimilation efficiency under nutrient-replete conditions
  * Typical value: 0.40-0.50 (zooplankton efficiently convert high-quality food)
  * Lower bound: 0.20 (must exceed epsilon_min)
  * Upper bound: 0.70 (biological maximum for zooplankton)

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
-----------------------------
1. More realistic bloom dynamics: Nutrient depletion reduces food quality, potentially limiting zooplankton response
2. Improved representation of nutrient recycling: Lower efficiency means more unassimilated material returned as nutrients
3. Potential for stoichiometric oscillations: Quality-quantity trade-offs in phytoplankton
4. Better match to observations where zooplankton don't fully control nutrient-limited phytoplankton blooms

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
--------------------
- The nutrient limitation factor is already calculated, so computational cost is minimal
- This modification maintains model stability (epsilon remains bounded between epsilon_min and epsilon_max)
- The change is mechanistically justified and adds ecological realism without excessive complexity
- Both new parameters have clear biological interpretations and can be constrained from literature
