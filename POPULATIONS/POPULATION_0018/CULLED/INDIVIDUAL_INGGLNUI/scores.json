  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the basic NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling from mortality and unassimilated grazing) and produces time-forward predictions. However it differs from the TRUTH NPZ in three main ways: (1) uptake in the candidate is a simple Michaelis\u2013Menten N-limited term (no explicit light limitation factor present in TRUTH), (2) grazing is Holling Type II in the candidate whereas TRUTH uses a Type-III (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) functional response, and (3) zooplankton mortality is implemented as quadratic density-dependent loss (m_Z * Z^2) rather than the TRUTH's linear mortality (q * Z). The candidate also omits the environmental mixing/entrainment term present in TRUTH for nutrients and phytoplankton (k*(N0 - N) and (s+k)*P). Recycling in the candidate is an aggregated term returning phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton mortality and unassimilated grazing to nutrients, which is structurally different but ecologically analogous to TRUTH's combination of specific recycling terms.",
