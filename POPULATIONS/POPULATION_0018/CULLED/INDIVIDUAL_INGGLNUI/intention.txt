NPZ Plankton Population Model

This model simulates the coupled dynamics of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z) in the oceanic mixed layer. The ecological functioning is based on the following processes:

1. Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton: Phytoplankton take up dissolved nutrients from the water column using a Michaelis-Menten (saturating) functional response, converting them into phytoplankton biomass with a specific efficiency.

2. Phytoplankton growth: Phytoplankton grow by consuming nutrients at a maximum rate that is limited by nutrient availability. Growth is temperature-independent in this formulation but could be extended.

3. Zooplankton grazing: Zooplankton consume phytoplankton using a Holling Type II functional response (saturating), which captures the handling time limitation at high prey densities. Only a fraction of consumed phytoplankton is converted to zooplankton biomass (assimilation efficiency).

4. Phytoplankton mortality: Phytoplankton experience natural mortality (disease, senescence, sinking) at a constant per-capita rate.

5. Zooplankton mortality: Zooplankton experience quadratic (density-dependent) mortality representing predation by higher trophic levels and other density-dependent losses.

6. Nutrient recycling: Nutrients are returned to the dissolved pool through phytoplankton mortality, inefficient zooplankton grazing (sloppy feeding), and zooplankton mortality. This creates a feedback loop that sustains the system.

The model captures the classic predator-prey oscillations often observed in plankton systems, with nutrients providing the basal resource that drives the entire food web. The saturating functional responses prevent unrealistic exponential growth and create more realistic dynamics including potential limit cycles or stable equilibria depending on parameter values.
