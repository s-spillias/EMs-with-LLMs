MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake kinetics
- Holling Type II grazing functional response
- Density-dependent zooplankton mortality
- Nutrient recycling pathways

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The current model only considers nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth, but in oceanic mixed layer systems, phytoplankton are typically co-limited by BOTH nutrients and light availability. This is a fundamental ecological process that is currently missing.

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: Light Limitation of Phytoplankton Growth

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. In the oceanic mixed layer, light availability is a primary driver of phytoplankton productivity
2. Light intensity decreases exponentially with depth due to water absorption
3. Phytoplankton biomass itself attenuates light (self-shading effect)
4. Growth is typically limited by the multiplicative interaction of light and nutrient availability

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Add a light limitation term (L) that represents the average light availability in the mixed layer:

L = (I_0 / (k_w * H)) * (1 - exp(-k_w * H - k_c * P * H))

Where:
- I_0 = surface light intensity (dimensionless, 0-1 scale)
- k_w = background light attenuation coefficient (m^-1)
- k_c = phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (m^2 (g C)^-1)
- H = mixed layer depth (m)

The phytoplankton growth term becomes:
nutrient_uptake = r_max * (N / (K_N + N)) * L * P

This represents co-limitation where both nutrient availability AND light availability constrain growth.

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
1. I_0: Surface light intensity (seasonal variation possible)
2. k_w: Water light attenuation coefficient
3. k_c: Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient
4. H: Mixed layer depth

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
- More realistic seasonal dynamics (light varies seasonally)
- Self-shading effects at high phytoplankton biomass
- Better representation of spring bloom dynamics
- Improved model fit to observed data patterns
