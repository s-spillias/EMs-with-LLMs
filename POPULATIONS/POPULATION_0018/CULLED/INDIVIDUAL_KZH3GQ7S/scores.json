  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth with assimilation, recycling from mortality and excretion) using standard alternative functional forms: Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by an explicit light limitation factor, Holling type II grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, and linear+quadratic zooplankton mortality. However, it departs from the TRUTH model in mixing/entrainment representation: the TRUTH uses a relaxation mixing term k*(N0 - N) (and includes k in phytoplankton losses), whereas the candidate uses a simple constant N_input source for nutrients and omits explicit P and Z mixing/entrainment terms. The candidate also adds an explicit light submodel (I_0, k_w, k_c, H) and density-dependent (quadratic) zooplankton mortality that are not present in the TRUTH formulation.",
