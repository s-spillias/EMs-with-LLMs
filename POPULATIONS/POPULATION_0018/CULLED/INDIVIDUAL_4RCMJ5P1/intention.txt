MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing NPZ model implements standard plankton dynamics with Monod nutrient uptake and Holling Type II grazing. However, it lacks a critical process for oceanic mixed layer systems: light limitation.

KEY MISSING PROCESS:
Light availability is a primary limiting factor for phytoplankton growth in oceanic systems. The current model assumes unlimited light, which leads to unrealistic dynamics where phytoplankton growth is only nutrient-limited.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
In oceanic mixed layers:
1. Light intensity decreases exponentially with depth (Beer-Lambert law)
2. Phytoplankton biomass causes self-shading, reducing light penetration
3. Growth is limited by the MINIMUM of nutrient and light availability (Liebig's Law)
4. This creates realistic bloom dynamics with self-limiting growth

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
Implement light limitation with self-shading by:

1. Adding light attenuation parameters:
   - I_0: Surface light intensity (W m^-2 or Î¼mol photons m^-2 s^-1)
   - k_w: Background light attenuation coefficient for water (m^-1)
   - k_c: Specific attenuation coefficient for phytoplankton self-shading (m^2 (g C)^-1)
   - H: Mixed layer depth (m)
   - I_k: Light saturation parameter for phytoplankton (W m^-2)

2. Calculating depth-averaged light availability:
   - Light at depth z: I(z) = I_0 * exp(-k_w * z - k_c * P * z)
   - Average light across mixed layer using analytical integration
   - Light limitation factor: f_I = (1 - exp(-I_avg/I_k))

3. Modifying phytoplankton growth:
   - Original: uptake = V_max * (N/(K_N + N)) * P
   - Modified: uptake = V_max * min(N/(K_N + N), f_I) * P
   - Or multiplicative: uptake = V_max * (N/(K_N + N)) * f_I * P

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
- More realistic phytoplankton bloom dynamics
- Self-limiting growth as blooms develop (negative feedback)
- Better representation of deep vs shallow mixed layer differences
- Potential for subsurface chlorophyll maxima if depth is variable

MATHEMATICAL APPROACH:
Using multiplicative limitation (both nutrient AND light must be available) rather than Liebig minimum, as this better represents the biochemical reality that both resources are needed simultaneously for photosynthesis.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Add 5 new parameters for light dynamics
- Modify EQUATION 1 (nutrient uptake) to include light limitation
- Use analytical solution for depth-averaged light to avoid numerical integration
- Maintain backward compatibility by setting light parameters to non-limiting values if desired
