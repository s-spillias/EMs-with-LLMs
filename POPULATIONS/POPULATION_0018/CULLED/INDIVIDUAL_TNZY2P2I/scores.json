  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) but uses simpler, common functional forms compared to the TRUTH model. Key differences: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use a Michaelis-Menten N-limitation \u00d7 biomass form rather than the two-factor N/(e+N) \u00d7 a/(b+cP) \u00d7 P in TRUTH; grazing is Holling Type II rather than the TRUTH P^2/(mu^2+P^2) formulation; zooplankton mortality includes an added quadratic density-dependent term not present in TRUTH; candidate uses a constant N_input source but omits the TRUTH mixing/dilution term k*(N0 - N) and omits the phytoplankton mixing/entrainment term. Nutrient recycling is present in both but parameterized differently (explicit excretion + mortality recycling in candidate). Numerically, the candidate uses forward Euler integration (discrete time steps) rather than continuous ODE solver; that is an implementation difference, not an ecological term.",
