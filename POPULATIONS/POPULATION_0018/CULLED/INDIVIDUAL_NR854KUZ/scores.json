  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a classic NPZ core (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth \u2192 grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth) but uses different functional forms and many additional ecological processes not present in the TRUTH python model. Uptake and growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis-Menten nutrient limitation times a light-saturation term (an alternate to the TRUTH's N/(e+N)*(a/(b+cP))*P form). Grazing is Holling type II (alternate to the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) predation kernel). Linear phytoplankton mortality matches the TRUTH exactly. The candidate, however, lacks the explicit mixing/entrainment term (k*(N0-N) or (s+k)*P) present in TRUTH, and it adds a detritus pool (production, remineralization, sinking), explicit seasonal light forcing and self-shading, Q10 temperature dependence on rates, and quadratic zooplankton mortality.",
