MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model implements a comprehensive NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) system with:
1. Seasonal light dynamics with self-shading
2. Temperature dependence via Q10 formulation for all biological rates
3. Variable zooplankton assimilation efficiency based on phytoplankton nutrient status
4. Holling Type II functional responses for nutrient uptake and grazing

Strengths:
- Well-parameterized from literature (most parameters have realistic bounds)
- Includes important environmental drivers (light, temperature)
- Variable assimilation efficiency captures food quality effects

=== IDENTIFIED GAP ===

The current model assumes FIXED STOICHIOMETRY - phytoplankton have a constant C:N ratio, with nutrient uptake exactly matching carbon growth (1:1 ratio in Equation 7).

However, real phytoplankton exhibit FLEXIBLE STOICHIOMETRY:
- Nutrient-replete cells: C:N ≈ 6.6 (Redfield ratio)
- Nutrient-limited cells: C:N can reach 15-20 or higher
- This affects nutrient demand, uptake efficiency, and recycling dynamics

The variable assimilation efficiency (epsilon_min to epsilon_max) partially captures downstream effects on zooplankton, but the mechanistic driver (phytoplankton stoichiometry) is not explicitly modeled.

=== PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT: DYNAMIC PHYTOPLANKTON C:N QUOTA ===

Implement a variable phytoplankton C:N ratio (Q) that responds to nutrient availability:

Q(N) = Q_min + (Q_max - Q_min) * exp(-N / K_Q)

Where:
- Q_min: minimum C:N ratio under nutrient-replete conditions (~6.6, Redfield ratio)
- Q_max: maximum C:N ratio under severe nutrient limitation (~15-20)
- K_Q: half-saturation constant for quota response (similar scale to K_N)

This affects three key processes:

1. NUTRIENT UPTAKE (modified Equation 7):
   Nutrient uptake = phyto_growth / Q(N)
   
   Under low nutrients: Q is high → less nutrient needed per unit carbon growth
   Under high nutrients: Q is low → more nutrient needed per unit carbon growth
   
   This creates a negative feedback: as nutrients decline, phytoplankton become more nutrient-efficient

2. FOOD QUALITY FOR ZOOPLANKTON (enhanced Equation 10):
   Current epsilon calculation uses nutrient_limitation as a proxy for food quality
   With explicit Q, we can use: food_quality = Q_min / Q(N)
   
   This provides a mechanistic basis for the existing variable assimilation efficiency

3. NUTRIENT RECYCLING (modified Equations 12-13):
   Nutrients released from phytoplankton mortality should reflect their actual nutrient content:
   nutrient_from_phyto = gamma_P * phyto_mortality / Q(N)
   
   Carbon-rich (high Q) phytoplankton release less nutrient when they die

=== ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION ===

This improvement:
1. Adds mechanistic realism based on well-established phytoplankton physiology (Droop 1968, 1974)
2. Creates stabilizing feedbacks: nutrient limitation → higher C:N → lower nutrient demand → slower nutrient depletion
3. Provides explicit mechanism for food quality variation (currently implicit via nutrient_limitation)
4. Affects nutrient cycling dynamics, potentially explaining bloom-crash patterns
5. Only adds 3 parameters (Q_min, Q_max, K_Q), all with clear biological meaning and measurable values

=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

- Q_min ≈ 6.6 (Redfield ratio in mol C/mol N, or equivalent in g C/g N)
- Q_max ≈ 15-20 (observed in severely N-limited cultures)
- K_Q ≈ 0.05-0.2 g C m^-3 (similar scale to K_N, controls steepness of quota response)
- The exponential form ensures smooth transition and biological realism
- This maintains backward compatibility: if Q_min = Q_max, the model reduces to fixed stoichiometry

=== EXPECTED OUTCOMES ===

1. More realistic nutrient dynamics during bloom development
2. Better representation of post-bloom nutrient regeneration
3. Mechanistic explanation for variable zooplankton growth efficiency
4. Potential for multiple stable states or oscillatory dynamics
5. Improved model fit during nutrient-limited phases
