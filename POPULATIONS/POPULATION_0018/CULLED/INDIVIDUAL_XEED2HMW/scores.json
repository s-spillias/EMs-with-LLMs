  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the core NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, phytoplankton growth and grazing, zooplankton growth and mortality) but often using different mathematical forms and many added ecological processes. Nutrient uptake is implemented as growth-linked uptake with a variable C:N quota (a Droop-like decoupling) rather than the TRUTH's direct Monod-like uptake. Grazing is implemented as Holling type II (saturating) instead of the TRUTH's sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) (type III). The candidate adds multiple extra processes not present in TRUTH: explicit temperature (Q10) modifiers, seasonal surface light with depth attenuation and self-shading, a dynamic stoichiometric quota (Q_current) used to decouple carbon growth and nutrient uptake, stoichiometry-dependent variable assimilation efficiency, and an explicit quadratic zooplankton mortality term. The candidate omits the TRUTH mixing/dilution form k*(N0 - N) (replaced by a constant N_input), and omits physical mixing/entrainment terms for phytoplankton and zooplankton present/expected in TRUTH for P (s+k) and absent for Z, respectively.",
