MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing NPZ model captures basic trophic interactions with:
- Nutrient-limited phytoplankton growth (Michaelis-Menten)
- Zooplankton grazing (Holling Type II)
- Nutrient recycling pathways
- Density-dependent zooplankton mortality

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The model lacks LIGHT LIMITATION, which is critical for phytoplankton in the oceanic mixed layer context. Phytoplankton growth depends on both nutrient availability AND light (photosynthetically active radiation). In the mixed layer, light attenuates exponentially with depth, and phytoplankton experience depth-averaged light conditions.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR LIGHT LIMITATION:
1. PROJECT CONTEXT explicitly mentions "oceanic mixed layer" where light is a primary limiting factor
2. Phytoplankton require light for photosynthesis - nutrient-only limitation is unrealistic
3. Light availability varies with:
   - Surface irradiance (seasonal, daily cycles)
   - Mixed layer depth (deeper mixing = lower average light)
   - Water clarity (attenuation by water and phytoplankton self-shading)
4. Co-limitation by light and nutrients creates more realistic population dynamics

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Add light limitation to phytoplankton growth rate using:
- I_0: Surface light intensity (PAR - photosynthetically active radiation)
- k_w: Background light attenuation coefficient (water clarity)
- k_c: Self-shading coefficient (phytoplankton reduce light penetration)
- H: Mixed layer depth
- Light limitation factor: (I_0/k_total*H) * (1 - exp(-k_total*H))
  where k_total = k_w + k_c*P

This represents depth-averaged light availability in a well-mixed layer with exponential attenuation.

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Modify phytoplankton growth to be co-limited by nutrients AND light:
- Original: r_max * (N/(K_N + N)) * P
- Modified: r_max * min(N/(K_N + N), Light_limitation) * P
  OR using multiplicative co-limitation: r_max * (N/(K_N + N)) * Light_limitation * P

The multiplicative form is more realistic as it allows for smooth transitions between limiting factors.

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
1. I_0: Surface light intensity (W m^-2 or Î¼mol photons m^-2 s^-1)
   - Typical range: 100-400 W m^-2 for oceanic conditions
   - Initial value: 200 W m^-2 (moderate light)

2. k_w: Background water attenuation coefficient (m^-1)
   - Typical range: 0.02-0.2 m^-1 for clear to turbid ocean water
   - Initial value: 0.04 m^-1 (clear oceanic water)

3. k_c: Phytoplankton self-shading coefficient (m^2 (g C)^-1)
   - Typical range: 0.01-0.1 m^2 (g C)^-1
   - Initial value: 0.03 m^2 (g C)^-1

4. H: Mixed layer depth (m)
   - Typical range: 10-200 m depending on season and location
   - Initial value: 50 m (moderate mixed layer)

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
1. More realistic seasonal dynamics (light varies seasonally)
2. Self-shading effects during blooms (negative feedback)
3. Deeper mixing reduces phytoplankton growth (dilution effect)
4. Better representation of spring bloom dynamics
5. Improved model fit to data showing light-driven patterns

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding a fundamental ecological process that is essential for oceanic mixed layer plankton dynamics.
