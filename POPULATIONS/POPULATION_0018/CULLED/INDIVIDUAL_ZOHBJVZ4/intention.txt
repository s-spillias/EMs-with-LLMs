MODEL ASSESSMENT:
=================

Current Model Structure:
- NPZ model with nutrient cycling (gamma_P, gamma_Z recycling efficiencies)
- Light limitation using Steele formulation with photoinhibition and self-shading
- Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake, Holling Type II grazing
- Linear + quadratic zooplankton mortality
- Mixed layer depth integration for light availability

Model Performance Considerations:
- The model captures basic plankton dynamics but assumes constant temperature
- All biological rate parameters (r_max, g_max, m_P, m_Z, m_Z2) are currently temperature-independent
- This is unrealistic for oceanic mixed layer systems where temperature varies seasonally

ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: Temperature-Dependent Metabolic Rates
==============================================================

Rationale:
----------
Temperature is a fundamental driver of metabolic rates in ectothermic organisms like plankton.
The Metabolic Theory of Ecology and extensive empirical evidence show that biological rates
follow exponential temperature dependence (Arrhenius or Q10 relationships).

In oceanic mixed layers:
- Temperature varies seasonally (5-25°C in temperate regions)
- Spring blooms are triggered by both light AND temperature increases
- Grazing pressure increases faster with temperature than phytoplankton growth
- This creates temperature-dependent predator-prey dynamics

Implementation:
---------------
Using Q10 formulation: rate(T) = rate(T_ref) * Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)

Where:
- T = current temperature (°C)
- T_ref = reference temperature where base rates are defined (°C)
- Q10 = factor by which rate changes per 10°C increase

Different processes have different Q10 values:
- Phytoplankton growth: Q10 ~ 1.5-2.5 (photosynthesis + respiration)
- Zooplankton grazing: Q10 ~ 2.0-3.0 (higher for heterotrophs)
- Mortality rates: Q10 ~ 1.5-2.0 (metabolic costs)

Mathematical Changes:
---------------------
1. Add temperature parameter T (data vector, varies with time)
2. Add reference temperature T_ref (parameter, typically 15-20°C)
3. Add Q10 coefficients: Q10_P (phytoplankton), Q10_Z (zooplankton), Q10_m (mortality)
4. Scale rates: r_max_T = r_max * Q10_P^((T-T_ref)/10)
5. Apply to: r_max, g_max, m_P, m_Z, m_Z2

Ecological Predictions:
-----------------------
- Warmer temperatures → faster growth and grazing
- Temperature-grazing coupling can prevent blooms in warm conditions
- Cold spring → delayed but potentially larger blooms
- Seasonal temperature cycles → realistic bloom phenology
- Captures metabolic constraints on population dynamics

This modification maintains model parsimony while adding critical environmental realism
for oceanic plankton systems.
