NPZ Model: Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton Dynamics in the Oceanic Mixed Layer

This model simulates the coupled dynamics of nutrients (N), phytoplankton (P), and zooplankton (Z) in a well-mixed oceanic surface layer. The model captures key ecological processes:

1. NUTRIENT DYNAMICS: Nutrients are depleted by phytoplankton uptake and replenished through remineralization of dead organic matter and zooplankton excretion. Nutrient limitation follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a half-saturation constant.

2. PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMICS: Phytoplankton grow through photosynthesis limited by nutrient availability, experience natural mortality, and are consumed by zooplankton. Growth follows a saturating functional response to nutrient concentration.

3. ZOOPLANKTON DYNAMICS: Zooplankton graze on phytoplankton with a Type II functional response (Holling disc equation), accounting for handling time and saturation at high prey densities. Zooplankton experience density-dependent mortality and excrete nutrients back into the system.

4. ENERGY TRANSFER: The model includes assimilation efficiencies representing the fraction of consumed biomass that is converted to consumer biomass versus being lost to respiration, excretion, and egestion.

5. NUTRIENT RECYCLING: A fraction of phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality is remineralized back to the nutrient pool, maintaining ecosystem productivity. This represents bacterial decomposition and the microbial loop.

The model represents a classic formulation used in biological oceanography to understand plankton bloom dynamics, trophic transfer efficiency, and nutrient cycling in pelagic ecosystems.
