  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure with explicit phytoplankton light limitation, Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, Holling-type grazing, linear phytoplankton mortality, and zooplankton growth from assimilated grazing. Many ecological roles of the TRUTH model are present but often in alternate mathematical form: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are represented as multiplicative nutrient\u00d7light limitation (with a Steele photoinhibition term) rather than the TRUTH's N/(e+N) * a/(b+cP) factor; grazing is Holling II instead of the TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form; recycling is present but expressed as excretion + mortality recycling; the candidate omits a TRUTH-like mixing relaxation term for nutrients (k*(N0 - N)) and omits phytoplankton mixing/entrainment loss. The candidate also adds explicit mixed-layer light attenuation/photoinhibition and a quadratic zooplankton mortality term that are not in TRUTH.",

TRUTH uses '- (N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P' \u2014 both are MM-style uptake multiplied by a light/other factor, so the candidate matches the Michaelis\u2013Menten uptake family but not the exact TRUTH algebra."
