MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT RATIONALE

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The existing NPZ model implements light-limited phytoplankton growth using a Monod (Michaelis-Menten) saturation function. While this captures light limitation at low intensities, it fails to represent photoinhibition - the well-documented phenomenon where excessive light intensity damages photosynthetic machinery and reduces growth rates.

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
1. Updated parameter I_0 = 443 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹ (range: 163-886) indicates high surface irradiance
2. At such high light levels, photoinhibition is ecologically significant in marine systems
3. The current monotonically increasing light response is unrealistic for surface mixed layers
4. Literature on phytoplankton photophysiology consistently shows hump-shaped P-I (photosynthesis-irradiance) curves

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Photoinhibition occurs when:
- High light intensities generate reactive oxygen species that damage PSII reaction centers
- Repair mechanisms cannot keep pace with damage rates
- Phytoplankton in well-mixed surface waters experience periodic exposure to inhibitory irradiances
- This is particularly important in oligotrophic (clear) waters where light penetrates deeply

PROPOSED MODIFICATION:
Replace the simple Monod light limitation function with a Steele-type formulation that includes photoinhibition:

OLD (Equation 2):
  light_limitation = I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)

NEW:
  light_limitation = (I_avg / I_opt) * exp(1 - I_avg / I_opt)

Where I_opt is the optimal light intensity for maximum photosynthesis.

MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES:
- At I_avg = I_opt: light_limitation = 1.0 (maximum growth)
- At I_avg < I_opt: growth increases with light (light-limited regime)
- At I_avg > I_opt: growth decreases with light (photoinhibited regime)
- At I_avg = 0: light_limitation = 0 (no growth in darkness)
- Smooth, differentiable function suitable for optimization

PARAMETER CHANGES:
- REMOVED: K_I (half-saturation for light) - no longer needed with Steele formulation
- ADDED: I_opt (optimal light intensity) - represents the irradiance at which photosynthesis is maximal
  * Typical values: 100-300 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹ for marine phytoplankton
  * Initial value: 150 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹
  * Bounds: 50-500 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
1. More realistic phytoplankton dynamics in high-light surface waters
2. Better representation of depth-integrated productivity
3. Potential for subsurface chlorophyll maxima formation (if depth structure added later)
4. Improved model fit when surface irradiance is high but phytoplankton growth is moderate

This modification maintains model parsimony (same number of light parameters) while significantly improving ecological realism for the oceanic mixed layer context.
