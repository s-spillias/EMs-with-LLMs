MODEL ASSESSMENT:
The current NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) model includes light limitation with self-shading and nutrient recycling, which are important processes. However, it lacks temperature dependence of biological rates, which is a critical driver of plankton dynamics in oceanic mixed layers.

IDENTIFIED GAP:
Temperature affects all biological rate processes in marine ecosystems. Metabolic Theory of Ecology and extensive empirical data show that phytoplankton growth, zooplankton grazing, and mortality rates typically have Q10 values of 2-3 (rates double or triple with each 10°C increase). Without temperature dependence, the model cannot capture:
1. Seasonal dynamics driven by mixed layer warming/cooling
2. Latitudinal gradients in plankton productivity
3. Responses to climate variability and change

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:
Implement temperature-dependent rate modifiers for key biological processes using the Arrhenius equation (exponential temperature dependence). This is the standard approach in marine biogeochemical models (e.g., NPZD models, DARWIN, PISCES).

MATHEMATICAL APPROACH:
Use the Q10 formulation: f_temp(T) = Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)
Where:
- T is the current temperature (°C)
- T_ref is a reference temperature (typically 15-20°C)
- Q10 is the temperature coefficient (typically 2-3 for biological rates)

This will be applied to:
1. Phytoplankton maximum growth rate (r_max)
2. Zooplankton maximum grazing rate (g_max)
3. Phytoplankton mortality rate (m_P)
4. Zooplankton mortality rates (m_Z, m_Z2)

ECOLOGICAL REALISM:
- Q10 values of 2-3 are well-established from laboratory and field studies
- Temperature data is readily available from oceanographic observations
- This modification maintains model parsimony while adding critical environmental forcing
- Allows model to capture temperature-driven phenology and productivity patterns

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Added Q10 and T_ref as parameters
- Temperature currently defaults to T_ref (constant temperature at reference value)
- When temperature data becomes available, it can be provided as a DATA_VECTOR
- Modified all biological rate calculations to include temperature multipliers
- At T = T_ref, f_temp = 1.0, so rates equal their baseline parameter values
- Model structure is ready for time-varying temperature forcing when data is available
