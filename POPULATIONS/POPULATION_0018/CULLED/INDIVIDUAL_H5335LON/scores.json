  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the basic NPZ roles (nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from zooplankton, grazing losses, phytoplankton and zooplankton mortalities, and zooplankton growth via grazing/assimilation). However, almost every term is implemented in an alternate form relative to the TRUTH NPZ (different functional responses, explicit light and temperature forcing, variable assimilation, and extra closure terms). Several canonical TRUTH terms (mixing/entrainment represented as k*(N0-N) and explicit P mixing loss -(s+k)*P) are absent or replaced by simpler/ different representations (constant N_input). The candidate therefore matches TRUTH in ecological roles but mostly via alternate functional forms and it introduces new processes (seasonal temperature/Q10 and explicit light attenuation/limitation, variable assimilation efficiency, quadratic zooplankton mortality, and a constant nutrient input term).",
