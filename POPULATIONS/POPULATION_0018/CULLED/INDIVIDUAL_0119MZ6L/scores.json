  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements the core NPZ processes but with several structural differences from the TRUTH model. Nutrient uptake is implemented as a Michaelis\u2013Menten type uptake co-limited by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert + Monod for light) \u2014 this is an extra, explicit light module not present in TRUTH. Recycling of nutrients from mortality and inefficient grazing is present but aggregated differently than in TRUTH. Phytoplankton mortality is a linear loss (matches TRUTH), but grazing is a Holling Type II formulation (TRUTH uses a different saturating P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form). Zooplankton grow from assimilated grazing (alpha*grazing) but have quadratic mortality (density-dependent) rather than the linear Z mortality in TRUTH. Important ecological processes in TRUTH representing environmental mixing/dilution for nutrients (k*(N0 - N)) and physical loss for phytoplankton (s + k) are missing in the candidate. The candidate also contains an explicit light attenuation + mixed-layer averaging component (I_avg, k_w, k_c, MLD) which is not in TRUTH.",
