MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake
- Holling Type II grazing
- Linear phytoplankton mortality and quadratic zooplankton mortality
- Nutrient recycling from mortality and inefficient grazing

IDENTIFIED GAPS:
1. CRITICAL MISSING PROCESS: Light limitation is absent from phytoplankton growth
   - In oceanic mixed layers, phytoplankton are co-limited by nutrients AND light
   - Light availability decreases with depth due to water absorption and self-shading
   - This is fundamental to realistic plankton dynamics, especially seasonal blooms

2. PARAMETER BOUND ISSUES:
   - Observation error parameters have inverted bounds (upper < lower)
   - These need correction for proper parameter estimation

PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
Add light limitation to phytoplankton growth using a multiplicative co-limitation framework.

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Light attenuation with depth (Beer-Lambert law):
   I(z) = I_0 * exp(-k_w * z - k_c * P * z)
   where:
   - I_0 = surface irradiance
   - k_w = background light attenuation by water
   - k_c = light attenuation by phytoplankton (self-shading)
   - z = depth

2. Average light in mixed layer:
   I_avg = I_0 * (1 - exp(-k_w * MLD - k_c * P * MLD)) / (k_w * MLD + k_c * P * MLD)

3. Light limitation function (Monod-type):
   f_light = I_avg / (K_I + I_avg)
   where K_I = half-saturation constant for light

4. Modified phytoplankton growth:
   uptake = V_max * f_nutrient * f_light * P
   where f_nutrient = N / (K_N + N)

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
- Phytoplankton require both nutrients and light for photosynthesis
- Light limitation is particularly important in:
  * Deep mixed layers (winter mixing)
  * High biomass conditions (self-shading during blooms)
  * Low light seasons (high latitudes)
- This creates realistic seasonal dynamics and bloom termination mechanisms
- Explains why high nutrients don't always lead to high phytoplankton biomass

NEW PARAMETERS ADDED:
1. log_I_0: Log surface light intensity (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
   - Typical range: 100-2000 μmol photons m^-2 s^-1
   - Varies seasonally and with latitude

2. log_k_w: Log background water light attenuation coefficient (m^-1)
   - Typical range: 0.02-0.2 m^-1
   - Depends on water clarity

3. log_k_c: Log phytoplankton-specific light attenuation (m^2 g C^-1)
   - Typical range: 0.01-0.1 m^2 g C^-1
   - Represents self-shading effect

4. log_K_I: Log half-saturation constant for light (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
   - Typical range: 20-100 μmol photons m^-2 s^-1
   - Species-dependent

5. log_MLD: Log mixed layer depth (m) - PARAMETER (constant)
   - Typical range: 10-200 m
   - Represents characteristic mixed layer depth for the system
   - Using as parameter since time-varying MLD data not available

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:
- More realistic seasonal bloom dynamics
- Better representation of light-nutrient co-limitation
- Improved model fit during low-light periods
- Mechanistic explanation for bloom termination beyond grazing

PARAMETER CORRECTIONS:
- Fixed inverted bounds on observation error parameters
- All sigma parameters now have consistent lower_bound < upper_bound

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
- MLD implemented as a constant parameter rather than time-varying data
- This assumes a characteristic mixed layer depth for the study period
- Can be updated to time-varying if MLD data becomes available
