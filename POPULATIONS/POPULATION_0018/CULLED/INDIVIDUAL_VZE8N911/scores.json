  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure: nutrient-limited, light-modulated phytoplankton growth, grazing-driven zooplankton growth with assimilation efficiency, recycling from mortality and unassimilated grazing, and observation/error machinery. Many ecological roles from TRUTH are present but functional forms differ. Nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth use Michaelis\u2013Menten (Monod) nutrient limitation multiplied by an explicit light limitation (Beer\u2013Lambert \u2192 Monod) rather than the TRUTH's a/(b + c*P) form. Grazing and zooplankton growth use Holling type II (P/(K+P)) rather than TRUTH's P^2/(mu^2+P^2). The candidate omits the TRUTH-style mixing/dilution term for N and P (TRUTH had k*(N0-N) and -k*P); instead it has a constant N_input source (no N sink proportional to N). The candidate also adds a quadratic zooplankton mortality term and an explicit light field (I_available, I_0, k_w, K_I).",

TRUTH: '- (N / (e + N)) * (a / (b + c * P)) * P'. Both use nutrient MM (N/(K+N)) multiplied by a light-dependent factor and scaled by P, but the light functional form differs (explicit Beer\u2013Lambert \u2192 Monod in candidate vs a/(b+cP) in TRUTH), so this is an alternate equivalent family."
