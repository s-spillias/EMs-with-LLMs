MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model represents a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system with light limitation and nutrient recycling. Key features include:
- Light limitation with self-shading (depth-averaged in mixed layer)
- Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake kinetics
- Holling Type II grazing functional response
- Nutrient recycling from mortality and inefficient feeding
- Quadratic zooplankton mortality (representing predation)

PARAMETER UPDATE OBSERVATION:
The parameter r_max (maximum phytoplankton growth rate) has been updated from literature with value 1.0 day^-1 and bounds [0.8, 1.2]. This update indicates that the growth rate is now based on empirical evidence.

CURRENT STATUS:
The model has been reverted to the baseline NPZ formulation without temperature dependence due to lack of temperature data in the current dataset. The temperature enhancement was removed to ensure the model compiles and runs with available data.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITY:
When temperature data becomes available, the model should be enhanced with temperature-dependent rate modification using Arrhenius/Q10 formulation:

f(T) = exp(k_T * (T - T_ref))

This would:
1. Apply temperature dependence to r_max (phytoplankton growth)
2. Apply temperature dependence to g_max (zooplankton grazing)
3. Apply temperature dependence to m_P and m_Z (mortality rates)
4. Enable exploration of seasonal dynamics and climate change scenarios

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR FUTURE ENHANCEMENT:
Temperature dependence is one of the most fundamental ecological relationships in aquatic systems. The Arrhenius formulation is widely used in biogeochemical models and supported by extensive empirical evidence. Adding this feature when data permits would:
- Increase model realism
- Make the literature-derived r_max value more interpretable as a reference rate
- Enable seasonal dynamics representation
- Provide foundation for climate change impact studies

CURRENT MODEL STRENGTHS:
- Includes light limitation with self-shading
- Nutrient recycling from both phytoplankton and zooplankton
- Holling Type II functional responses
- Literature-informed growth rate parameter
