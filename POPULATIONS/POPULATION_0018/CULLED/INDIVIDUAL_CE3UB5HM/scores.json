  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ NPZ implements the canonical NPZ roles (nutrient uptake, recycling, grazing, mortality, zooplankton growth) but uses alternate functional forms for several processes and omits explicit physical mixing terms present in the TRUTH model. Uptake and phytoplankton growth are modelled as a product of a Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient term and an explicit depth-averaged light limitation (an alternate to the TRUTH a/(b+cP) factor). Grazing/assimilation and zooplankton growth are present but use Holling Type II (P/(K_P+P)) rather than the TRUTH's Type-III-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2). Zooplankton mortality includes an added quadratic term and the candidate uses a simple constant nutrient input instead of a dilution/entrainment term proportional to (N0-N). Overall many biological processes match literature alternates, but physical mixing/entrainment terms for N, P, and Z (as in TRUTH) are not represented equivalently.",
