  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements an NPZ interaction network with the same high-level compartments (N, P, Z) and has the expected flows: phytoplankton growth, grazing, recycling and zooplankton mortality. However the mathematical forms differ in many places. The candidate uses multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation together with an explicit light limitation (and seasonal light forcing/attenuation) and Q10 temperature modifiers; grazing is Holling Type II rather than the TRUTH Type-III-like P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form; phytoplankton mortality is linear but stress-modulated rather than the TRUTH linear + explicit mixing term; nutrient mixing/dilution k*(N0 - N) from TRUTH is not present (replaced by a simple N_input source). Overall the candidate matches the ecological roles but uses alternate functional forms common in the literature and adds several extra processes (temperature/Q10, seasonal light and self-shading, stress-dependent mortality, quadratic zooplankton mortality).",
