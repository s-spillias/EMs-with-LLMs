  "qualitative_description": "The candidate C++ model implements the core NPZ interactions (nutrient uptake \u2192 phytoplankton growth, grazing \u2192 zooplankton growth, recycling from mortality and unassimilated grazing). However the mathematical forms differ from the TRUTH NPZ: uptake/growth are implemented as multiplicative Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient limitation \u00d7 saturating light limitation (with seasonal and depth-attenuation light physics), grazing is Holling type II (candidate) vs a sigmoidal P^2/(mu^2+P^2) form in TRUTH, and zooplankton growth uses a variable assimilation efficiency. Important omissions relative to TRUTH: the candidate lacks an explicit mixing/entrainment dilution term of the form k*(N0 - N) or -k*P/-k*Z (only a constant N_input source is present). The candidate also adds many ecological refinements not present in TRUTH (Q10 temperature modifiers, seasonal light and self-shading, stress-dependent phytoplankton mortality, variable assimilation efficiency, quadratic zooplankton mortality).",
