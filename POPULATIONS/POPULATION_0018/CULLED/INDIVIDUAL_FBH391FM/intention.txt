MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

=== CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION ===

The model represents a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) system with the following features:
- Light limitation with self-shading (via k_w and k_c parameters)
- Nutrient limitation via Michaelis-Menten kinetics
- Holling Type II functional response for zooplankton grazing
- Nutrient recycling from mortality and inefficient feeding
- External nutrient input

Strengths:
1. Includes realistic light attenuation in the mixed layer
2. Captures phytoplankton self-shading effects
3. Represents nutrient recycling pathways
4. Uses well-established functional forms for limitation processes

Weaknesses identified:
1. All biological rates are temperature-independent
2. Parameters like r_max, g_max, m_P, m_Z represent rates at an implicit reference temperature
3. Cannot capture seasonal temperature-driven dynamics
4. Missing a fundamental driver of metabolic processes in aquatic ecosystems

=== ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT: TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE FRAMEWORK ===

Rationale:
Temperature is one of the most important environmental drivers of plankton dynamics in the ocean. Metabolic rates, including photosynthesis, respiration, grazing, and mortality, all increase exponentially with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation or Q10 formulation. The current model parameters (e.g., r_max = 0.5 day⁻¹) implicitly represent rates at some reference temperature, but the model cannot respond to temperature variation.

Implementation:
Add temperature dependence framework using Q10 formulation for key biological rates:
- r_max: phytoplankton maximum growth rate
- g_max: zooplankton maximum grazing rate  
- m_P: phytoplankton mortality rate
- m_Z: zooplankton mortality rate

Mathematical form:
rate(T) = rate_ref * Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)

Where:
- rate_ref is the rate at reference temperature T_ref
- Q10 is the factor by which the rate increases for a 10°C temperature increase
- T is the ambient temperature
- T_ref is the reference temperature (typically 15-20°C for temperate systems)

Current implementation status:
The model now includes T_ref and Q10 parameters, establishing the temperature dependence framework. In the current version, temperature is held constant at T_ref (so temp_effect = 1.0), making the model functionally equivalent to the previous version but with the infrastructure ready for temperature forcing when temperature time series data becomes available.

Ecological justification:
1. Q10 values of 1.5-3.0 are well-documented for phytoplankton and zooplankton
2. Temperature drives seasonal succession in plankton communities
3. Allows model to capture spring blooms (warming) and fall decline (cooling)
4. Maintains existing parameter values as reference rates at T_ref
5. Adds minimal complexity (2 new parameters: Q10 and T_ref) for substantial ecological realism
6. Framework is ready for future temperature forcing data

Expected improvements when temperature forcing is added:
- Better representation of seasonal dynamics
- Ability to simulate temperature-driven regime shifts
- More realistic coupling between physical (temperature) and biological processes
- Improved model fit if observational data spans different temperatures/seasons

=== PARAMETER ADDITIONS ===

New parameters:
1. T_ref: Reference temperature (°C) - the temperature at which current rate parameters apply
2. Q10: Temperature coefficient (dimensionless) - factor by which rates increase per 10°C

The existing rate parameters (r_max, g_max, m_P, m_Z) now explicitly represent rates at T_ref.

Note: Temperature forcing data vector has been removed from parameters.json as it is not currently available in the dataset. The model uses T_ref as a constant temperature, but the Q10 framework is in place for future use when temperature time series data becomes available.
