MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a standard NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with:
- Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake (V_max, K_N)
- Holling Type II grazing (g_max, K_P)
- Linear phytoplankton mortality (m_P)
- Quadratic zooplankton mortality (m_Z)
- Nutrient recycling with efficiency parameters (alpha, gamma)

IDENTIFIED GAP:
The current model treats phytoplankton growth as purely nutrient-limited. However, in the oceanic mixed layer (PROJECT CONTEXT), phytoplankton are typically co-limited by BOTH nutrients AND light. Light availability is a critical factor that:
1. Decreases exponentially with depth due to water absorption
2. Is further reduced by phytoplankton self-shading (turbidity)
3. Creates important density-dependent feedback mechanisms
4. Explains realistic boom-bust dynamics in phytoplankton populations

PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
Add light limitation to phytoplankton growth using a depth-averaged light availability model appropriate for mixed layer dynamics.

MATHEMATICAL APPROACH:
Modify the nutrient uptake equation to include multiplicative light limitation:
- Original: uptake = V_max * (N/(K_N + N)) * P
- Modified: uptake = V_max * (N/(K_N + N)) * L_avg * P

Where L_avg is the depth-averaged light availability calculated as:
L_avg = (I_0 / (k_w + k_c * P) / H) * (1 - exp(-(k_w + k_c * P) * H))

NEW PARAMETERS:
1. log_I_0: Log surface light intensity (μmol photons m^-2 s^-1)
   - Represents photosynthetically active radiation at the surface
   - Literature range: 100-2000 μmol photons m^-2 s^-1
   - Initial value: log(500) ≈ 6.2

2. log_k_w: Log background light attenuation coefficient (m^-1)
   - Represents light absorption by water and dissolved materials
   - Literature range: 0.02-0.2 m^-1 for clear to coastal waters
   - Initial value: log(0.05) ≈ -3.0

3. log_k_c: Log phytoplankton-specific light attenuation coefficient (m^2 g C^-1)
   - Represents self-shading effect of phytoplankton biomass
   - Literature range: 0.01-0.05 m^2 g C^-1
   - Initial value: log(0.02) ≈ -3.9

4. log_H: Log mixed layer depth (m)
   - Depth over which phytoplankton are mixed
   - Literature range: 10-100 m depending on season and location
   - Initial value: log(30) ≈ 3.4

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Light is a fundamental resource for photosynthesis - its omission is a significant gap
2. Self-shading (via k_c parameter) creates realistic density-dependent regulation
3. Mixed layer depth affects average light availability experienced by phytoplankton
4. This mechanism can explain spring blooms (high light, high nutrients) and summer crashes (nutrient depletion despite high light)
5. The multiplicative form (nutrient × light) represents co-limitation, consistent with Liebig's law of the minimum in its continuous form

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
- More realistic phytoplankton dynamics with light-nutrient co-limitation
- Self-shading feedback preventing unrealistic phytoplankton blooms
- Better representation of seasonal dynamics in oceanic mixed layers
- Improved model fit if light limitation is indeed occurring in the data
