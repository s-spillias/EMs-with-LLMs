MODEL ASSESSMENT:

Current Model Performance:
- The model implements a comprehensive NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) framework with light limitation including photoinhibition
- Light dynamics use Steele formulation with self-shading, which is appropriate for the parameter values (I_opt = 150, I_0 = 443)
- Nutrient recycling pathways are included from both phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality
- Zooplankton mortality includes both linear and quadratic terms (density-dependent predation)

Key Ecological Gap Identified:
The model lacks temperature dependence for metabolic processes. Temperature is a fundamental driver of biological rates in marine ecosystems, affecting:
1. Phytoplankton growth and respiration rates
2. Zooplankton grazing and metabolic rates
3. Bacterial decomposition and nutrient remineralization

This is particularly important for:
- Seasonal dynamics (temperature varies significantly through the year)
- Vertical mixing events that bring different temperature water masses
- Climate change scenarios
- Comparison across different oceanic regions

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENT:

Add temperature-dependent metabolic scaling using Q10 formulation:

Ecological Justification:
- Metabolic Theory of Ecology shows that biological rates scale exponentially with temperature
- Q10 values (rate change per 10°C) are well-established for marine plankton:
  * Phytoplankton growth: Q10 ≈ 1.88 (Eppley, 1972; meta-analysis of culture studies)
  * Zooplankton grazing: Q10 ≈ 2.8 (Hansen et al., 1997; experimental feeding studies)
  * Bacterial remineralization: Q10 ≈ 2.0 (Rivkin & Legendre, 2001)
- Temperature effects are multiplicative with other limitation factors

Mathematical Implementation:
- Temperature-dependent structure added to model code
- Reference temperature (T_ref) and Q10 parameters for different processes included
- Rates scaled using: f(T) = Q10^((T - T_ref)/10)
- Applied to: r_max (phytoplankton growth), g_max (grazing), m_P (phytoplankton mortality), m_Z (zooplankton mortality)

Current Status:
- Temperature data (T_dat) is not yet available in the dataset
- Model currently runs with constant temperature at T_ref (15°C)
- When T = T_ref, temperature scaling factors equal 1.0 (no effect on rates)
- This maintains backward compatibility while preparing the model structure for future temperature forcing

Expected Improvements (when temperature data becomes available):
1. Better capture of seasonal bloom dynamics driven by temperature changes
2. More realistic representation of metabolic balance between autotrophs and heterotrophs
3. Improved model transferability across temperature regimes
4. Foundation for climate change impact assessments

Parameters Added:
- T_ref: Reference temperature for rate normalization (°C) - currently 15°C, typical for temperate oceans
- Q10_phyto: Temperature coefficient for phytoplankton processes (dimensionless, 1.88 from literature)
- Q10_zoo: Temperature coefficient for zooplankton processes (dimensionless, 2.8 from literature)

Note: T_dat (temperature time series) was removed from DATA_VECTOR requirements to allow model to compile and run without temperature observations. The temperature-dependent framework is in place and will become active when temperature data is provided.

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding a well-established ecological mechanism that will significantly affect plankton dynamics once temperature forcing is available.
