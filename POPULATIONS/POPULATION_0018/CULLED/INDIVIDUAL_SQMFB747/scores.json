  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a conventional NPZ structure with nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, recycling from mortalities and unassimilated grazing, and explicit grazing-driven zooplankton growth. Many terms correspond to standard alternate formulations in the literature (Michaelis\u2013Menten nutrient uptake, Holling-type grazing, linear + quadratic mortality) rather than the exact algebra used in the TRUTH Python model. The candidate also adds processes not present in the TRUTH model: explicit light limitation with photoinhibition, explicit Q10 temperature scaling on rates, and a quadratic zooplankton mortality term. Where TRUTH used a relaxation/mixing term k*(N0 - N) and a P^2/(mu^2+P^2)-type functional response, the candidate typically uses simpler constant input (N_input) and Michaelis-type saturating functions for nutrient/grazing and multiplicative light \u00d7 nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth.",
