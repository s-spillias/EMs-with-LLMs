  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard, parsimonious NPZ formulation: Monod/Michaelis-Menten nutrient uptake multiplied by P, Holling type-II grazing, linear (first-order) mortalities for P and Z, and recycling that returns mortality and un-assimilated grazing to N. These are ecologically plausible but differ from the TRUTH model in key functional forms: TRUTH uses a more complex phytoplankton limitation combining nutrient and light/self-shading (N/(e+N) * a/(b+cP) * P) and a Type-III-like grazing term (P^2/(mu^2+P^2)) with separate recycling terms. The candidate omits the environmental mixing/entrainment terms present in TRUTH for N and P. The candidate also includes modeling/estimation machinery (observation error SDs, soft parameter penalties, non-negativity guards, Euler integration) that are not ecological processes.",
