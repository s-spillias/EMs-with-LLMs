  "qualitative_description": "The C++ candidate implements a standard NPZ structure (N uptake by P, P growth/losses, Z growth from grazing, Z mortality) but uses different functional forms from the TRUTH python model. Key differences: nutrient uptake and phytoplankton growth are implemented as simple Michaelis-Menten (r_max * N/(K_N+N) * P) rather than the TRUTH's combined nutrient+phytoplankton-dependent term (N/(e+N) * a/(b + c*P) * P); grazing is Holling type II in the candidate (g_max * P/(K_P+P) * Z) vs a Hill-like P^2/(mu^2 + P^2) term in TRUTH; nutrient mixing is implemented as a constant input (N_input) rather than TRUTH's restoring term k*(N0 - N); zooplankton mortality includes an extra quadratic term (m_Z2 * Z^2) not present in TRUTH. The candidate does include nutrient recycling from phytoplankton mortality and from zooplankton (excretion + mortality) but with different partitioning than TRUTH. Overall, components are ecologically plausible and map to the canonical list, but several are alternates rather than exact matches.",
