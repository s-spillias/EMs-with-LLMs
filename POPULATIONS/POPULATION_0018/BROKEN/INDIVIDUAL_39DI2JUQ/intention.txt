NPZ Model: Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton Dynamics in the Oceanic Mixed Layer

This model simulates the coupled dynamics of nutrients, phytoplankton, and zooplankton in a marine ecosystem. The model captures key ecological processes:

1. Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, representing saturating resource limitation at high nutrient concentrations.

2. Phytoplankton growth is controlled by nutrient availability and experiences natural mortality and grazing pressure from zooplankton.

3. Zooplankton grazing follows a Holling Type II functional response, capturing handling time limitations and predator saturation at high prey densities.

4. Nutrient recycling occurs through phytoplankton mortality, zooplankton excretion, and zooplankton mortality, creating feedback loops that sustain the system.

5. The model includes grazing efficiency (assimilation efficiency) and excretion rates that determine how consumed phytoplankton biomass is partitioned between zooplankton growth, waste products, and nutrient regeneration.

This formulation represents a classic NPZ model structure widely used in biological oceanography, capable of producing realistic oscillatory dynamics and equilibrium states observed in marine ecosystems.
