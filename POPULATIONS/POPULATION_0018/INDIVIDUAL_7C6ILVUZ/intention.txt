MODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN

CURRENT MODEL EVALUATION:
The model implements a comprehensive NPZ (Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton) system with:
- Temperature-dependent metabolic rates using Q10 formulation
- Light limitation with phytoplankton self-shading
- Nutrient limitation via Michaelis-Menten kinetics
- Holling Type II functional response for grazing
- Nutrient recycling from mortality and sloppy feeding

PARAMETER ANALYSIS:
Review of parameters.json reveals that Q10_phyto has been updated from literature searches (value: 2.7, bounds: 2.0-3.4), indicating strong empirical support for temperature sensitivity. However, the current model implementation sets T_prev = T_ref (constant temperature), rendering all temperature factors equal to 1.0. While the Q10 framework is correctly implemented, it remains inactive until temperature data becomes available.

IDENTIFIED GAP - MISSING SEASONAL FORCING:
The most significant missing ecological process is SEASONAL LIGHT VARIATION. The current model uses a constant surface light intensity (I_0 = 443 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹), but oceanic mixed layer ecosystems experience dramatic seasonal changes in solar radiation that drive:
- Spring phytoplankton blooms (increasing light + nutrients)
- Summer productivity peaks (maximum light availability)
- Fall transitions (declining light)
- Winter light limitation (minimum productivity)

This seasonal forcing is fundamental to temperate and polar ocean dynamics and is often the primary driver of phytoplankton phenology, even more important than temperature in many systems.

PROPOSED ECOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT:
Implement SEASONAL LIGHT VARIATION using a sinusoidal function to modulate surface light intensity over an annual cycle.

ECOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATION:
1. Solar radiation varies predictably with season due to Earth's axial tilt
2. Light availability is the primary environmental driver of phytoplankton phenology in many oceanic regions
3. The model already has sophisticated light limitation machinery (depth averaging, self-shading via k_c)
4. Seasonal light variation interacts with existing processes:
   - Affects nutrient drawdown timing (spring bloom)
   - Modulates grazing pressure (zooplankton respond to phytoplankton blooms)
   - Influences nutrient recycling dynamics
5. This is a parsimonious addition (3 parameters) that captures a major environmental forcing

MATHEMATICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
Replace constant I_0 with time-varying function:
I_0(t) = I_0_mean * (1 + I_0_amplitude * sin(2π * (t - t_phase) / 365))

Where:
- I_0_mean: Annual mean surface light intensity (replaces current I_0)
- I_0_amplitude: Fractional amplitude of seasonal variation (0 = no seasonality, 1 = light varies from 0 to 2*mean)
- t_phase: Day of year when light peaks (phase shift, typically ~172 for Northern Hemisphere summer solstice)

NEW PARAMETERS:
1. I_0_mean: 443 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹ (current I_0 value becomes the mean)
   - Bounds: 163-886 (same as original I_0 range)
   
2. I_0_amplitude: 0.4 (dimensionless, 0-1)
   - Represents ±40% variation around mean (realistic for temperate latitudes)
   - Bounds: 0.0-1.0 (0 = no seasonality, 1 = maximum variation)
   
3. t_phase: 172 days (June 21, Northern Hemisphere summer solstice)
   - Bounds: 0-365 (allows fitting to different latitudes/hemispheres)

EXPECTED ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:
1. Spring bloom: Increasing light + winter nutrient accumulation → phytoplankton peak
2. Summer: High light but nutrient depletion → moderate phytoplankton, high zooplankton
3. Fall: Declining light + some nutrient replenishment → secondary bloom possible
4. Winter: Low light limits growth despite nutrient availability

This improvement maintains model parsimony while adding a critical environmental forcing that will enable the model to capture realistic seasonal dynamics in oceanic mixed layer plankton populations.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- The original I_0 parameter will be replaced by I_0_mean
- Time-varying I_0(t) is calculated at each time step before light limitation calculations
- All downstream light calculations (attenuation, depth averaging, limitation factor) remain unchanged
- This modification is backward compatible: setting I_0_amplitude = 0 recovers the original constant light model
